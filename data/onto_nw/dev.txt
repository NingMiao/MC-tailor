Investors unsettled by the stock market 's gyrations can take some comfort in the predictable arrival of quarterly dividend checks .
That has been particularly true this year with many companies raising their payouts more than 10 % .
But do n't breathe too easy : Those dividend increases may signal trouble ahead for stock prices , some analysts warn .
In the past , they say , the strongest dividend growth has often come at times when the stock - market party was almost over .
That can be a trap for unwary investors , says Richard Bernstein , senior quantitative analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co .
Strong dividend growth , he says , is `` the black widow of valuation '' -- a reference to the female spiders that attract males and then kill them after mating .
Stephen Boesel , president of T. Rowe Price Growth and Income Fund , explains that companies raise their payouts most robustly only after the economy and corporate profits have been growing for some time .
`` Invariably , those strong periods in the economy give way to recessionary environments , '' he says .
`` And recessionary environments are n't hospitable to the stock market . ''
Indeed , analysts say that payouts have sometimes risen most sharply when prices were already on their way down from cyclical peaks .
In 1976 , for example , dividends on the stocks in Standard & Poor 's 500 - stock index soared 10 % , following much slower growth the year before .
The S&P index started sliding in price in September 1976 , and fell 12 % in 1977 -- despite a 15 % expansion in dividends that year .
That pattern has n't always held , but recent strong growth in dividends makes some market watchers anxious .
Payouts on the S&P 500 stocks rose 10 % in 1988 , according to Standard & Poor 's Corp. , and Wall Street estimates for 1989 growth are generally between 9 % and 14 % .
Many people believe the growth in dividends will slow next year , although a minority see double - digit gains continuing .
Meanwhile , many market watchers say recent dividend trends raise another warning flag : While dividends have risen smartly , their expansion has n't kept pace with even stronger advances in stock prices .
As a result , the market 's dividend yield -- dividends as a percentage of price -- has slid to a level that is fairly low and unenticing by historical standards .
Put another way , the decline in the yield suggests stocks have gotten pretty rich in price relative to the dividends they pay , some market analysts say .
They are keeping a close watch on the yield on the S&P 500 .
The figure is currently about 3.3 % , up from 3.2 % before the recent market slide .
Some analysts say investors should run for the exits if a sustained market rebound pushes the yield below 3 % .
A drop below that 3 % benchmark `` has always been a strong warning sign that stocks are fully valued , '' says Mr. Boesel of T. Rowe Price .
In fact , `` the market has always tanked .
Always .
There 's never been an exception , '' says Gerald W. Perritt , a Chicago investment adviser and money manager , based on a review of six decades of stock - market data .
The last time the S&P 500 yield dropped below 3 % was in the summer of 1987 .
Stockholders who took the hint and sold shares escaped the October debacle .
There have been only seven other times -- in 1929 , 1933 , 1961 , 1965 , 1968 , 1971 and 1972 -- when the yield on the S&P 500 dropped below 3 % for at least two consecutive months , Mr. Perritt found .
And in each case , he says , a sharp drop in stock prices began within a year .
Still , some market analysts say the current 3.3 % reading is n't as troublesome as it might have been in years past .
`` It 's not a very meaningful indicator currently because corporations are not behaving in a traditional manner , '' says James H. Coxon , head of stock investments for Cigna Corp. , the Philadelphia - based insurer .
In particular , Mr. Coxon says , businesses are paying out a smaller percentage of their profits and cash flow in the form of dividends than they have historically .
So , while stock prices may look fairly high relative to dividends , they are not excessive relative to the underlying corporate strength .
Rather than increasing dividends , some companies have used cash to buy back some of their shares , notes Steven G. Einhorn , co-chairman of the investment policy committee at Goldman , Sachs & Co .
He factors that into the market yield to get an adjusted yield of about 3.6 % .
That is just a tad below the average of the past 40 years or so , he says .
What will happen to dividend growth next year ?
Common wisdom suggests a single - digit rate of growth , reflecting a weakening in the economy and corporate profits .
PaineWebber Inc. , for instance , is forecasting growth in S&P 500 dividends of just under 5 % in 1990 , down from an estimated 11 % this year .
In other years in which there have been moderate economic slowdowns -- the environment the firm expects in 1990 -- the change in dividends ranged from a gain of 4 % to a decline of 1 % , according to PaineWebber analyst Thomas Doerflinger .
The minority argument , meanwhile , is that businesses have the financial wherewithal this time around to declare sharply higher dividends even if their earnings weaken .
Dividend growth on the order of 12 % is expected by both Mr. Coxon of Cigna and Mr. Einhorn of Goldman Sachs .
Those dividend bulls argue that corporations are in the unusual position of having plenty of cash left over after paying dividends and making capital expenditures .
One indicator investors might want to watch is the monthly tally from Standard & Poor 's of the number of public companies adjusting their dividends .
A total of 139 companies raised dividends in October , basically unchanged from 138 a year ago , S&P said Wednesday .
That followed four straight months in which the number of increases trailed the year - earlier pace .
While the S&P tally does n't measure the magnitude of dividend changes , a further slippage in the number of dividend increases could be a harbinger of slower dividend growth next year .
In any case , opinion is mixed on how much of a boost the overall stock market would get even if dividend growth continues at double - digit levels .
Mr. Einhorn of Goldman Sachs estimates the stock market will deliver a 12 % to 15 % total return from appreciation and dividends over the next 12 months -- vs. a `` cash rate of return '' of perhaps 7 % or 8 % if dividend growth is weak .
But Mr. Boesel of T. Rowe Price , who also expects 12 % growth in dividends next year , does n't think it will help the overall market all that much .
`` Having the dividend increases is a supportive element in the market outlook , but I do n't think it 's a main consideration , '' he says .
With slower economic growth and flat corporate earnings likely next year , `` I would n't look for the market to have much upside from current levels .
INGERSOLL - RAND Co . -LRB- Woodcliff Lake , N.J . -RRB- --
William G. Kuhns , former chairman and chief executive officer of General Public Utilities Corp. , was elected a director of this maker of industrial and construction equipment , increasing board membership to 10 .
Cathryn Rice could hardly believe her eyes .
While giving the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills to ninth graders at Greenville High School last March 16 , she spotted a student looking at crib sheets .
She had seen cheating before , but these notes were uncanny .
`` A stockbroker is an example of a profession in trade and finance ... .
At the end of World War II , Germany surrendered before Japan ... .
The Senate - House conference committee is used when a bill is passed by the House and Senate in different forms . ''
Virtually word for word , the notes matched questions and answers on the social - studies section of the test the student was taking .
In fact , the student had the answers to almost all of the 40 questions in that section .
The student surrendered the notes , but not without a protest .
`` My teacher said it was OK for me to use the notes on the test , '' he said .
The teacher in question was Nancy Yeargin -- considered by many students and parents to be one of the best at the school .
Confronted , Mrs. Yeargin admitted she had given the questions and answers two days before the examination to two low - ability geography classes .
She had gone so far as to display the questions on an overhead projector and underline the answers .
Mrs. Yeargin was fired and prosecuted under an unusual South Carolina law that makes it a crime to breach test security .
In September , she pleaded guilty and paid a $ 500 fine .
Her alternative was 90 days in jail .
Her story is partly one of personal downfall .
She was an unstinting teacher who won laurels and inspired students , but she will probably never teach again .
In her wake she left the bitterness and anger of a principal who was her friend and now calls her a betrayer ; of colleagues who say she brought them shame ; of students and parents who defended her and insist she was treated harshly ; and of school - district officials stunned that despite the bald - faced nature of her actions , she became something of a local martyr .
Mrs. Yeargin 's case also casts some light on the dark side of school reform , where pressures on teachers are growing and where high - stakes testing has enhanced the temptation to cheat .
The 1987 statute Mrs. Yeargin violated was designed to enforce provisions of South Carolina 's school - improvement laws .
Prosecutors alleged that she was trying to bolster students ' scores to win a bonus under the state 's 1984 Education Improvement Act .
The bonus depended on her ability to produce higher student - test scores .
`` There is incredible pressure on school systems and teachers to raise test scores , '' says Walt Haney , an education professor and testing specialist at Boston College .
`` So efforts to beat the tests are also on the rise . ''
And most disturbing , it is educators , not students , who are blamed for much of the wrongdoing .
A 50 - state study released in September by Friends for Education , an Albuquerque , N.M. , school - research group , concluded that `` outright cheating by American educators '' is `` common . ''
The group says standardized achievement test scores are greatly inflated because teachers often `` teach the test '' as Mrs. Yeargin did , although most are never caught .
Evidence of widespread cheating has surfaced in several states in the last year or so .
California 's education department suspects adult responsibility for erasures at 40 schools that changed wrong answers to right ones on a statewide test .
After numerous occurrences of questionable teacher help to students , Texas is revising its security practices .
And sales of test - coaching booklets for classroom instruction are booming .
These materials , including Macmillan / McGraw - Hill School Publishing Co. 's Scoring High and Learning Materials -- are nothing short of sophisticated crib sheets , according to some recent academic research .
By using them , teachers -- with administrative blessing -- telegraph to students beforehand the precise areas on which a test will concentrate , and sometimes give away a few exact questions and answers .
Use of Scoring High is widespread in South Carolina and common in Greenville County , Mrs. Yeargin 's school district .
Experts say there is n't another state in the country where tests mean as much as they do in South Carolina .
Under the state 's Education Improvement Act , low test scores can block students ' promotions or force entire districts into wrenching , state - supervised `` interventions '' that can mean firings .
High test scores , on the other hand , bring recognition and extra money -- a new computer lab for a school , grants for special projects , a bonus for the superintendent .
And South Carolina says it is getting results .
Since the reforms went in place , for example , no state has posted a higher rate of improvement on the Scholastic Aptitude Test than South Carolina , although the state still posts the lowest average score of the about 21 states who use the SAT as the primary college entrance examination .
Critics say South Carolina is paying a price by stressing improved test scores so much .
Friends of Education rates South Carolina one of the worst seven states in its study on academic cheating .
Says the organization 's founder , John Cannell , prosecuting Mrs. Yeargin is `` a way for administrators to protect themselves and look like they take cheating seriously , when in fact they do n't take it seriously at all . ''
Paul Sandifer , director of testing for the South Carolina department of education , says Mr. Cannell 's allegations of cheating `` are purely without foundation , '' and based on unfair inferences .
Partly because of worries about potential abuse , however , he says the state will begin keeping closer track of achievement - test preparation booklets next spring .
South Carolina 's reforms were designed for schools like Greenville High School .
Standing on a shaded hill in a run - down area of this old textile city , the school has educated many of South Carolina 's best and brightest , including the state 's last two governors , Nobel Prize winning physicist Charles Townes and actress Joanne Woodward .
But by the early 1980s , its glory had faded like the yellow bricks of its broad facade .
`` It was full of violence and gangs and kids cutting class , '' says Linda Ward , the school 's principal .
`` Crime was awful , test scores were low , and there was no enrollment in honors programs . ''
Mrs. Ward took over in 1986 , becoming the school 's seventh principal in 15 years .
Her immediate predecessor suffered a nervous breakdown .
Prior to his term , a teacher bled to death in the halls , stabbed by a student .
Academically , Mrs. Ward says , the school was having trouble serving in harmony its two disparate , and evenly split , student groups : a privileged white elite from old monied neighborhoods and blacks , many of them poor , from run - down , inner city neighborhoods .
Mrs. Ward resolved to clean out `` deadwood '' in the school 's faculty and restore safety , and she also had some new factors working in her behalf .
One was statewide school reform , which raised overall educational funding and ushered in a new public spirit for school betterment .
Another was Nancy Yeargin , who came to Greenville in 1985 , full of the energy and ambitions that reformers wanted to reward .
`` Being a teacher just became my life , '' says the 37 - year - old Mrs. Yeargin , a teacher for 12 years before her dismissal . ``
I loved the school , its history .
I even dreamt about school and new things to do with my students . ''
While Mrs. Ward fired and restructured staff and struggled to improve curriculum , Mrs. Yeargin worked 14 - hour days and fast became a student favorite .
In 1986 - 87 and 1987 - 88 , she applied for and won bonus pay under the reform law .
Encouraged by Mrs. Ward , Mrs. Yeargin taught honor students in the state `` teacher cadet '' program , a reform creation designed to encourage good students to consider teaching as a career .
She won grant money for the school , advised cheerleaders , ran the pep club , proposed and taught a new `` Cultural Literacy '' class in Western Civilization and was chosen by the school PTA as `` Teacher of the Year . ''
`` She was an inspirational lady ; she had it all together , '' says Laura Dobson , a freshman at the University of South Carolina who had Mrs. Yeargin in the teacher - cadet class last year .
She says that because of Mrs. Yeargin she gave up ambitions in architecture and is studying to become a teacher .
Mary Beth Marchand , a Greenville 11th grader , also says Mrs. Yeargin inspired her to go into education .
`` She taught us more in Western Civilization than I 've ever learned in other classes , '' says Kelli Green , a Greenville senior .
In the classroom , students say , Mrs. Yeargin distinguished herself by varying teaching approaches -- forcing kids to pair up to complete classroom work or using college - bowl type competitions .
On weekends , she came to work to prepare study plans or sometimes , even to polish the furniture in her classroom .
`` She just never gave it up , '' says Mary Marchand , Mary Beth 's mother .
`` You 'd see her correcting homework in the stands at a football game . ''
Some fellow teachers , however , viewed Mrs. Yeargin as cocky and too yielding to students .
Mrs. Ward says she often defended her to colleagues who called her a grandstander .
Pressures began to build .
Friends told her she was pushing too hard .
Because of deteriorating hearing , she told colleagues she feared she might not be able to teach much longer .
Mrs. Yeargin 's extra work was also helping her earn points in the state 's incentive - bonus program .
But the most important source of points was student improvement on tests .
Huge gains by her students in 1987 and 1988 meant a total of $ 5,000 in bonuses over two years -- a meaningful addition to her annual salary of $ 23,000 .
Winning a bonus for a third year was n't that important to her , Mrs. Yeargin insists .
But others at Greenville High say she was eager to win -- if not for money , then for pride and recognition .
Mary Elizabeth Ariail , another social - studies teacher , says she believed Mrs. Yeargin wanted to keep her standing high so she could get a new job that would n't demand good hearing .
Indeed , Mrs. Yeargin was interested in a possible job with the state teacher cadet program .
Last March , after attending a teaching seminar in Washington , Mrs. Yeargin says she returned to Greenville two days before annual testing feeling that she had n't prepared her low - ability geography students adequately .
When test booklets were passed out 48 hours ahead of time , she says she copied questions in the social studies section and gave the answers to students .
Mrs. Yeargin admits she made a big mistake but insists her motives were correct .
`` I was trying to help kids in an unfair testing situation , '' she says .
`` Only five of the 40 questions were geography questions .
The rest were history , sociology , finance -- subjects they never had . ''
Mrs. Yeargin says that she also wanted to help lift Greenville High School 's overall test scores , usually near the bottom of 14 district high schools in rankings carried annually by local newspapers .
Mostly , she says , she wanted to prevent the damage to self - esteem that her low - ability students would suffer from doing badly on the test .
`` These kids broke my heart , '' she says .
`` A whole day goes by and no one even knows they 're alive .
They desperately needed somebody who showed they cared for them , who loved them .
The last thing they needed was another drag - down blow . ''
School officials and prosecutors say Mrs. Yeargin is lying .
They found students in an advanced class a year earlier who said she gave them similar help , although because the case was n't tried in court , this evidence was never presented publicly .
`` That pretty much defeats any inkling that she was out to help the poor underprivileged child , '' says Joe Watson , the prosecutor in the case , who is also president of Greenville High School 's alumni association .
Mrs. Yeargin concedes that she went over the questions in the earlier class , adding : `` I wanted to help all '' students .
Mr. Watson says Mrs. Yeargin never complained to school officials that the standardized test was unfair .
`` Do I have much sympathy for her ? '' Mr. Watson asks .
`` Not really .
I believe in the system .
I believe you have to use the system to change it .
What she did was like taking the law into your own hands . ''
Mrs. Ward says that when the cheating was discovered , she wanted to avoid the morale - damaging public disclosure that a trial would bring .
She says she offered Mrs. Yeargin a quiet resignation and thought she could help save her teaching certificate .
Mrs. Yeargin declined .
`` She said something like ` You just want to make it easy for the school . '
I was dumbfounded , '' Mrs. Ward recalls .
`` It was like someone had turned a knife in me . ''
To the astonishment and dismay of her superiors and legal authorities -- and perhaps as a measure of the unpopularity of standardized tests -- Mrs . Yeargin won widespread local support .
The school - board hearing at which she was dismissed was crowded with students , teachers and parents who came to testify on her behalf .
Supportive callers decried unfair testing , not Mrs. Yeargin , on a local radio talk show on which she appeared .
The show did n't give the particulars of Mrs. Yeargin 's offense , saying only that she helped students do better on the test .
`` The message to the board of education out of all this is we 've got to take a serious look at how we 're doing our curriculum and our testing policies in this state , '' said the talk - show host .
Editorials in the Greenville newspaper allowed that Mrs. Yeargin was wrong , but also said the case showed how testing was being overused .
The radio show `` enraged us , '' says Mrs. Ward .
Partly because of the show , Mr. Watson says , the district decided not to recommend Mrs. Yeargin for a first - time offenders program that could have expunged the charges and the conviction from her record .
And legal authorities cranked up an investigation worthy of a murder case .
Over 50 witnesses , mostly students , were interviewed .
At Greenville High School , meanwhile , some students -- especially on the cheerleading squad -- were crushed .
`` It 's hard to explain to a 17 - year - old why someone they like had to go , '' says Mrs. Ward .
Soon , T - shirts appeared in the corridors that carried the school 's familiar red - and - white GHS logo on the front .
On the back , the shirts read , `` We have all the answers . ''
Many colleagues are angry at Mrs. Yeargin .
`` She did a lot of harm , '' says Cathryn Rice , who had discovered the crib notes .
`` We work damn hard at what we do for damn little pay , and what she did cast unfair aspersions on all of us . ''
But several teachers also say the incident casts doubt on the wisdom of evaluating teachers or schools by using standardized test scores .
Says Gayle Key , a mathematics teacher , `` The incentive pay thing has opened up a can of worms .
There may be others doing what she did . ''
Mrs. Yeargin says she pleaded guilty because she realized it would no longer be possible to win reinstatement , and because she was afraid of further charges .
Mrs. Ward , for one , was relieved .
Despite the strong evidence against Mrs. Yeargin , popular sentiment was so strong in her favor , Mrs. Ward says , that `` I 'm afraid a jury would n't have convicted her .
South Korea registered a trade deficit of $ 101 million in October , reflecting the country 's economic sluggishness , according to government figures released Wednesday .
Preliminary tallies by the Trade and Industry Ministry showed another trade deficit in October , the fifth monthly setback this year , casting a cloud on South Korea 's export - oriented economy .
Exports in October stood at $ 5.29 billion , a mere 0.7 % increase from a year earlier , while imports increased sharply to $ 5.39 billion , up 20 % from last October .
South Korea 's economic boom , which began in 1986 , stopped this year because of prolonged labor disputes , trade conflicts and sluggish exports .
Government officials said exports at the end of the year would remain under a government target of $ 68 billion .
Despite the gloomy forecast , South Korea has recorded a trade surplus of $ 71 million so far this year .
From January to October , the nation 's accumulated exports increased 4 % from the same period last year to $ 50.45 billion .
Imports were at $ 50.38 billion , up 19 % .
Judging from the Americana in Haruki Murakami 's `` A Wild Sheep Chase '' -LRB- Kodansha , 320 pages , $ 18.95 -RRB- , baby boomers on both sides of the Pacific have a lot in common .
Although set in Japan , the novel 's texture is almost entirely Western , especially American .
Characters drink Salty Dogs , whistle `` Johnny B. Goode '' and watch Bugs Bunny reruns .
They read Mickey Spillane and talk about Groucho and Harpo .
They worry about their careers , drink too much and suffer through broken marriages and desultory affairs .
This is Japan ?
For an American reader , part of the charm of this engaging novel should come in recognizing that Japan is n't the buttoned - down society of contemporary American lore .
It 's also refreshing to read a Japanese author who clearly does n't belong to the self - aggrandizing `` we - Japanese '' school of writers who perpetuate the notion of the unique Japanese , unfathomable by outsiders .
If `` A Wild Sheep Chase '' carries an implicit message for international relations , it 's that the Japanese are more like us than most of us think .
That 's not to say that the nutty plot of `` A Wild Sheep Chase '' is rooted in reality .
It 's imaginative and often funny .
A disaffected , hard - drinking , nearly - 30 hero sets off for snow country in search of an elusive sheep with a star on its back at the behest of a sinister , erudite mobster with a Stanford degree .
He has in tow his prescient girlfriend , whose sassy retorts mark her as anything but a docile butterfly .
Along the way , he meets a solicitous Christian chauffeur who offers the hero God 's phone number ; and the Sheep Man , a sweet , roughhewn figure who wears -- what else -- a sheepskin .
The 40 - year - old Mr. Murakami is a publishing sensation in Japan .
A more recent novel , `` Norwegian Wood '' -LRB- every Japanese under 40 seems to be fluent in Beatles lyrics -RRB- , has sold more than four million copies since Kodansha published it in 1987 .
But he is just one of several youthful writers -- Tokyo 's brat pack -- who are dominating the best - seller charts in Japan .
Their books are written in idiomatic , contemporary language and usually carry hefty dashes of Americana .
In Robert Whiting 's `` You Gotta Have Wa '' -LRB- Macmillan , 339 pages , $ 17.95 -RRB- , the Beatles give way to baseball , in the Nipponese version we would be hard put to call a `` game . ''
As Mr. Whiting describes it , Nipponese baseball is a `` mirror of Japan 's fabled virtues of hard work and harmony . ''
`` Wa '' is Japanese for `` team spirit '' and Japanese ballplayers have miles and miles of it .
A player 's commitment to practice and team image is as important as his batting average .
Polls once named Tokyo Giants star Tatsunori Hara , a `` humble , uncomplaining , obedient soul , '' as the male symbol of Japan .
But other than the fact that besuboru is played with a ball and a bat , it 's unrecognizable : Fans politely return foul balls to stadium ushers ; the strike zone expands depending on the size of the hitter ; ties are permitted -- even welcomed -- since they honorably sidestep the shame of defeat ; players must abide by strict rules of conduct even in their personal lives -- players for the Tokyo Giants , for example , must always wear ties when on the road .
`` You Gotta Have Wa '' is the often amusing chronicle of how American ballplayers , rationed to two per team , fare in Japan .
Despite the enormous sums of money they 're paid to stand up at a Japanese plate , a good number decide it 's not worth it and run for home .
`` Funny Business '' -LRB- Soho , 228 pages , $ 17.95 -RRB- by Gary Katzenstein is anything but .
It 's the petulant complaint of an impudent American whom Sony hosted for a year while he was on a Luce Fellowship in Tokyo -- to the regret of both parties .
In sometimes amusing , more often supercilious , even vicious passages , Mr. Katzenstein describes how Sony invades even the most mundane aspects of its workers ' lives -- at the regimented office , where employees are assigned lunch partners -- and at `` home '' in the austere company dormitory run by a prying caretaker .
Some of his observations about Japanese management style are on the mark .
It 's probably true that many salarymen put in unproductive overtime just for the sake of solidarity , that the system is so hierarchical that only the assistant manager can talk to the manager and the manager to the general manager , and that Sony was chary of letting a young , short - term American employee take on any responsibility .
All of this must have been enormously frustrating to Mr. Katzenstein , who went to Sony with degrees in business and computer science and was raring to invent another Walkman .
But Sony ultimately took a lesson from the American management books and fired Mr. Katzenstein , after he committed the social crime of making an appointment to see the venerable Akio Morita , founder of Sony .
It 's a shame their meeting never took place .
Mr. Katzenstein certainly would have learned something , and it 's even possible Mr. Morita would have too .

More and more corners of the globe are becoming free of tobacco smoke .
In Singapore , a new law requires smokers to put out their cigarettes before entering restaurants , department stores and sports centers or face a $ 250 fine .
Discos and private clubs are exempt from the ban , and smoking will be permitted in bars except during meal hours , an official said .
Singapore already bans smoking in all theaters , buses , public elevators , hospitals and fast - food restaurants .
In Malaysia , Siti Zaharah Sulaiman , a deputy minister in the prime minister 's office , launched a `` No - Smoking Week '' at the Mara Institute of Technology near Kuala Lumpur and urged other schools to ban on - campus smoking .
South Korea has different concerns .
In Seoul , officials began visiting about 26,000 cigarette stalls to remove illegal posters and signboards advertising imported cigarettes .
South Korea has opened its market to foreign cigarettes but restricts advertising to designated places .
A marketing study indicates that Hong Kong consumers are the most materialistic in the 14 major markets where the survey was carried out .
The study by the Backer Spielvogel Bates ad agency also found that the colony 's consumers feel more pressured than those in any of the other surveyed markets , which include the U.S. and Japan .
The survey found that nearly half of Hong Kong consumers espouse what it identified as materialistic values , compared with about one - third in Japan and the U.S. .
More than three in five said they are under a great deal of stress most of the time , compared with less than one in two U.S. consumers and one in four in Japan .
The Thai cabinet endorsed Finance Minister Pramual Sabhavasu 's proposal to build a $ 19 million conference center for a joint meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund two years from now .
The meeting , which is expected to draw 20,000 to Bangkok , was going to be held at the Central Plaza Hotel , but the government balked at the hotel 's conditions for undertaking necessary expansion .
A major concern about the current plan is whether the new center can be built in such a short time .
Yasser Arafat has written to the chairman of the International Olympic Committee asking him to back a Palestinian bid to join the committee , the Palestine Liberation Organization news agency WAFA said .
An official of the Palestinian Olympic Committee said the committee first applied for membership in 1979 and renewed its application in August of this year .
The PLO in recent months has been trying to join international organizations but failed earlier this year to win membership in the World Health Organization and the World Tourism Organization .
A Beijing food - shop assistant has become the first mainland Chinese to get AIDS through sex , the People 's Daily said .
It said the man , whom it did not name , had been found to have the disease after hospital tests .
Once the disease was confirmed , all the man 's associates and family were tested , but none have so far been found to have AIDS , the newspaper said .
The man had for a long time had `` a chaotic sex life , '' including relations with foreign men , the newspaper said .
The Polish government increased home electricity charges by 150 % and doubled gas prices .
The official news agency PAP said the increases were intended to bring unrealistically low energy charges into line with production costs and compensate for a rise in coal prices .
In happier news , South Korea , in establishing diplomatic ties with Poland yesterday , announced $ 450 million in loans to the financially strapped Warsaw government .
In a victory for environmentalists , Hungary 's parliament terminated a multibillion - dollar River Danube dam being built by Austrian firms .
The Nagymaros dam was designed to be twinned with another dam , now nearly complete , 100 miles upstream in Czechoslovakia .
In ending Hungary 's part of the project , Parliament authorized Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth to modify a 1977 agreement with Czechoslovakia , which still wants the dam to be built .
Mr. Nemeth said in parliament that Czechoslovakia and Hungary would suffer environmental damage if the twin dams were built as planned .
Czechoslovakia said in May it could seek $ 2 billion from Hungary if the twindam contract were broken .
The Czech dam ca n't be operated solely at peak periods without the Nagymaros project .

In this era of frantic competition for ad dollars , a lot of revenue - desperate magazines are getting pretty cozy with advertisers -- fawning over them in articles and offering pages of advertorial space .
So can a magazine survive by downright thumbing its nose at major advertisers ?
Garbage magazine , billed as `` The Practical Journal for the Environment , '' is about to find out .
Founded by Brooklyn , N.Y. , publishing entrepreneur Patricia Poore , Garbage made its debut this fall with the promise to give consumers the straight scoop on the U.S. waste crisis .
The magazine combines how - to pieces on topics like backyard composting , explanatory essays on such things as what happens after you flush your toilet , and hard - hitting pieces on alleged environmental offenders .
Garbage editors have dumped considerable energy into a whirling rampage through supermarket aisles in a bid to identify corporate America 's good guys and bad boys .
In one feature , called `` In the Dumpster , '' editors point out a product they deem to be a particularly bad offender .
From an advertising standpoint , the problem is these offenders are likely to be some of the same folks that are major magazine advertisers these days .
With only two issues under its belt , Garbage has alienated some would - be advertisers and raised the ire of others .
Campbell Soup , for one , is furious its Souper Combo microwave product was chastised in the premiere `` In the Dumpster '' column .
The magazine 's editors ran a giant diagram of the product with arrows pointing to the packaging 's polystyrene foam , polyproplene and polyester film -- all plastic items they say are non-biodegradable .
`` It 's precisely the kind of product that 's created the municipal landfill monster , '' the editors wrote .
`` I think that this magazine is not only called Garbage , but it is practicing journalistic garbage , '' fumes a spokesman for Campbell Soup .
He says Campbell was n't even contacted by the magazine for the opportunity to comment .
Modifications had been made to the Souper Combo product at the time the issue was printed , he says , making it less an offender than was portrayed .
He admits , though , it is n't one of Campbell Soup 's better products in terms of recyclability .
Campbell Soup , not surprisingly , does n't have any plans to advertise in the magazine , according to its spokesman .
Some media experts question whether a young magazine can risk turning off Madison Avenue 's big spenders .
`` You really need the Campbell Soups of the world to be interested in your magazine if you 're going to make a run of it , '' says Mike White , senior vice president and media director at DDB Needham , Chicago .
`` The economics of magazine publishing pretty much require that you have a pretty solid base '' of big - time ad spenders , he adds .
The first two issues featured ads from only a handful of big advertisers , including General Electric and Adolph Coors , but the majority were from companies like Waste Management Inc. and Bumkins International , firms that do n't spend much money advertising and ca n't be relied on to support a magazine over the long haul .
A Waste Management spokeswoman says its ad in the premiere issue was a one - time purchase , and it does n't have any plans to advertise in future issues .
`` We do n't spend much on print advertising , '' she says .
But Ms. Poore , the magazine 's editor and publisher , contends Garbage can survive , at least initially , on subscription revenues .
Individual copies of the magazine sell for $ 2.95 and yearly subscriptions cost $ 21 .
-LRB- It is , of course , printed on recycled paper . -RRB-
According to Ms. Poore , Old - House Journal Corp. , her publishing company , printed and sold all 126,000 copies of the premiere issue .
The first and second issues sold out on newsstands , she says , and the magazine has orders for 93,000 subscriptions .
Asked whether potential advertisers will be scared away by the magazine 's direct policy , Ms. Poore replies : `` I do n't know and I do n't care .
I 'm not saying advertising revenue is n't important , '' she says , `` but I could n't sleep at night '' if the magazine bowed to a company because they once took out an ad .

It said that volume makes it the largest supplier of original TV programming in Europe .
Interpublic is providing the programming in return for advertising time , which it said will be valued at more than $ 75 million in 1990 and $ 150 million in 1991 .
It plans to sell the ad time to its clients at a discount .

The Internal Revenue Service has threatened criminal sanctions against lawyers who fail to report detailed information about clients who pay them more than $ 10,000 in cash .
The warnings , issued to at least 100 criminal defense attorneys in several major cities in the last week , have led to an outcry by members of the organized bar , who claim the information is protected by attorney - client privilege .
The IRS warnings stem from a 1984 law that requires anyone who receives more than $ 10,000 in cash from a client or customer in one or more related transactions `` in the course of trade or business '' to report the payment on a document known as Form 8300 .
The form asks for such details as the client 's name , Social Security number , passport number and details about the services provided for the payment .
Failure to complete the form had been punishable as a misdemeanor until last November , when Congress determined that the crime was a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison .
Attorneys have argued since 1985 , when the law took effect , that they can not provide information about clients who do n't wish their identities to be known .
Many attorneys have returned incomplete forms to the IRS in recent years , citing attorney - client privilege .
Until last week , the IRS rarely acted on the incomplete forms .
`` This form forces a lawyer to become , in effect , a witness against his client , '' said Neal R. Sonnett , president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers .
`` The IRS is asking lawyers to red - flag a criminal problem to the government , '' added Mr. Sonnett , a Miami lawyer who has heard from dozens of attorneys who received letters in recent days and has himself received the computer - generated IRS forms sent by certified mail .
Mr. Sonnett said that clients who pay cash may include alleged drug dealers who do n't have domestic bank accounts .
These individuals may not necessarily be under investigation when they hire lawyers .
Mr. Sonnett said there also may be other circumstances under which individuals would n't want the government to know they had retained criminal defense lawyers .
Filling out detailed forms about these individuals would tip the IRS off and spark action against the clients , he said .
The defense lawyers ' group formed a task force this week , chaired by New York attorney Gerald Lefcourt , to deal with the matter .
The American Bar Association 's House of Delegates passed a resolution in 1985 condemning the IRS reporting requirement .
Michael Ross , a New York lawyer who heads the ABA 's grand jury committee , said that lawyers are prohibited by the ABA 's code of ethics from disclosing information about a client except where a court orders it or to prevent the client from committing a criminal act that could result in death .
Mr. Ross said he met with officials of the IRS and the Justice Department , which would bring any enforcement actions against taxpayers , to discuss the issue last May .
At that meeting , he said , the Justice Department assured him that enforcement procedures would n't be threatened against attorneys without further review and advance notice .
Mr. Ross said IRS officials opposed the Justice Department 's moderate stance on the matter .
But in the letters sent in recent days , Christopher J. Lezovich of the IRS computing center in Detroit , told attorneys that `` failing to voluntarily submit the requested information could result in summons enforcement action being initiated . ''
In some cases , the IRS asked for information dating back to forms it received in 1985 .
A spokesman for the IRS confirmed that `` there has been correspondence mailed about incomplete 8300s , '' but he declined to say why the letters were sent to lawyers now .
Individuals familiar with the Justice Department 's policy said that Justice officials had n't any knowledge of the IRS 's actions in the last week .
Lawyers worry that if they provide information about clients , that data could quickly end up in the hands of prosecutors .
Prosecutors need court permission to obtain the tax returns of an individual or a business .
But they have obtained 8300 forms without court permission and used the information to help develop criminal cases .
Some criminal lawyers speculated that the IRS was sending the letters to test the issue .
In a number of recent cases , federal courts have refused to recognize attorneys ' assertions that information relating to fees from clients should be confidential .
THE WAR OVER FEDERAL JUDICIAL SALARIES takes a victim .
Often , judges ease into more lucrative private practice with little fanfare , but not federal Judge Raul A. Ramirez in Sacramento , Calif .
On Tuesday , the judge called a news conference to say he was quitting effective Dec. 31 to join a San Francisco law firm .
The reason : the refusal of Congress to give federal judges a raise .
`` A couple of my law clerks were going to pass me in three or four years , and I was afraid I was going to have to ask them for a loan , '' the judge quipped in an interview .
Federal judges make $ 89,500 annually ; in February , Congress rejected a bill that would have increased their pay by 50 % .
Judge Ramirez , 44 , said it is unjust for judges to make what they do .
`` Judges are not getting what they deserve .
You look around at professional ballplayers or accountants ... and nobody blinks an eye .
When you become a federal judge , all of a sudden you are relegated to a paltry sum . ''
At his new job , as partner in charge of federal litigation in the Sacramento office of Orrick , Herrington & Sutcliffe , he will make out much better .
The judge declined to discuss his salary in detail , but said : `` I 'm going to be a high - priced lawyer . ''
DOONESBURY CREATOR'S UNION TROUBLES are no laughing matter .
Cartoonist Garry Trudeau is suing the Writers Guild of America East for $ 11 million , alleging it mounted a `` campaign to harass and punish '' him for crossing a screenwriters ' picket line .
The dispute involves Darkhorse Productions Inc. , a TV production company in which Mr. Trudeau is a co-owner .
Mr. Trudeau , a Writers Guild member , also was employed as a writer for Darkhorse , which was covered by a guild collective - bargaining agreement .
The guild began a strike against the TV and movie industry in March 1988 .
In his lawsuit , Mr. Trudeau says the strike illegally included Darkhorse , and the cartoonist refused to honor the strike against the company .
A spokesman for the guild said the union 's lawyers are reviewing the suit .
He said disciplinary proceedings are confidential and declined to comment on whether any are being held against Mr. Trudeau .
Mr. Trudeau 's attorney , Norman K. Samnick , said the harassment consists mainly of the guild 's year - long threats of disciplinary action .
Mr. Samnick said a guild disciplinary hearing is scheduled next Monday in New York .
Mr. Samnick , who will go before the disciplinary panel , said the proceedings are unfair and that any punishment from the guild would be unjustified .
In addition to the damages , the suit seeks a court order preventing the guild from punishing or retaliating against Mr. Trudeau .
ABORTION RULING UPHELD :
A federal appeals court upheld a lower court ruling that the U.S. can bar the use of federal funds for family - planning programs that include abortion - related services .
A Department of Health and Human Services rule adopted in 1988 prohibits the use of so - called Title X funds for programs that assist a woman in obtaining an abortion , such as abortion counseling and referrals .
The rule also prohibits funding for activities that `` encourage , promote or advocate abortion . ''
Title X funds are the single largest source of federal funding for family - planning services , according to the opinion by the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York .
The panel ruled that the restrictions do n't violate the freedom of speech of health care providers and that the limits on counseling services do n't violate the rights of pregnant women .
INQUIRY CLEARS TEXAS JUDGE of bias in comments on homosexual murder victims .
Dallas District Judge Jack Hampton had sparked calls for a judicial inquiry with his remarks to the press last December , two weeks after sentencing an 18 - year - old defendant to 30 years in state prison for killing two homosexual men in a city park .
The judge was quoted as referring to the victims as `` queers '' and saying they would n't have been killed `` if they had n't been cruising the streets picking up teenage boys . ''
But Robert R. Murray , a special master appointed by the Texas Supreme Court , said Judge Hampton did n't breach any judicial standards of fairness , although he did violate the state 's judicial code by commenting publicly on a pending case .
Observing that the judge `` has never exhibited any bias or prejudice , '' Mr. Murray concluded that he `` would be impartial in any case involving a homosexual or prostitute '' as a victim .
Mr. Murray also said Judge Hampton 's comments did n't discredit the judiciary or the administration of justice .
The report is subject to review by the State Commission on Judicial Conduct , which is empowered to impose sanctions .
GAF TRIAL goes to round three .
Attorneys in the third stock - manipulation trial of GAF Corp. began opening arguments yesterday in the Manhattan courtroom of U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe .
In an eight - count indictment , the government has charged GAF , a Wayne , N.J. , specialty chemical maker , and its Vice Chairman James T. Sherwin with attempting to manipulate the common stock of Union Carbide Corp. in advance of GAF 's planned sale of a large block of the stock in November 1986 .
The first two GAF trials ended in mistrials earlier this year .
This trial is expected to last five weeks .
SWITCHING TO THE DEFENSE :
A former member of the prosecution team in the Iran / Contra affair joined the Chicago firm of Mayer , Brown & Platt .
Michael R. Bromwich , a member since January 1987 of the three - lawyer trial team in the prosecution of Oliver North , became a partner in the Washington , D.C. , office of the 520 - lawyer firm .
He will specialize in white - collar criminal defense work .
Mr. Bromwich , 35 , also has served as deputy chief and chief of the narcotics unit for the U.S. attorney 's office for the Southern District of New York , based in Manhattan .
A licensing company representing the University of Pennsylvania added Johnson & Johnson to its lawsuit challenging a university faculty member over rights to Retin - A acne medicine .
University Patents Inc. , based in Westport , Conn. , said it seeks Johnson & Johnson 's profits from sales of Retin - A , estimated at $ 50 million , a similar amount of punitive damages and the right to license Retin - A elsewhere .
In May , University Patents filed a suit in federal court in Philadelphia against Albert M. Kligman , a researcher and professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine who developed Retin - A in the 1960s to combat acne .
Dr. Kligman patented the medicine while employed by the University , but later licensed the Retin - A to a division of Johnson & Johnson .
In New Brunswick , N.J. , a Johnson & Johnson spokesman declined comment .
The House voted to boost the federal minimum wage for the first time since early 1981 , casting a solid 382 - 37 vote for a compromise measure backed by President Bush .
The vote came after a debate replete with complaints from both proponents and critics of a substantial increase in the wage floor .
Advocates said the 90 - cent - an - hour rise , to $ 4.25 an hour by April 1991 , is too small for the working poor , while opponents argued that the increase will still hurt small business and cost many thousands of jobs .
But the legislation reflected a compromise agreed to on Tuesday by President Bush and Democratic leaders in Congress , after congressional Republicans urged the White House to bend a bit from its previous resistance to compromise .
So both sides accepted the compromise , which would lead to the first lifting of the minimum wage since a four - year law was enacted in 1977 , raising the wage to $ 3.35 an hour from $ 2.65 .
Under the measure passed yesterday , the minimum wage would rise to $ 3.80 next April .
The Senate plans to take up the measure quickly and is expected to pass it .
`` There are no smiles about this bill , '' Rep. Pat Williams -LRB- D. , Mont . -RRB- said during House floor debate yesterday .
But `` because it 's all we 've got , I 'm going to vote for it . ''
While the minimum wage had traditionally been pegged at half the average U.S. manufacturing wage , the level of $ 4.25 an hour in 1991 will still be less than 35 % of average factory pay , Mr. Williams said .
But Rep. Marge Roukema -LRB- R. , N.J . -RRB- instead praised the House 's acceptance of a new youth `` training '' wage , a subminimum that GOP administrations have sought for many years .
Adopting a training - wage policy means `` getting beyond the nickel and diming of the minimum wage , '' Mrs. Roukema said .
Policy makers regard the youth wage as helping to limit the loss of jobs from an increase in the minimum wage , but they have lately touted it as necessary to help impart job skills to entrants into the work force .
Labor unions and Democrats long fought the idea , but recently acceded to it in the face of Bush administration insistence .
The compromise sets the training wage at $ 3.35 an hour next April , and at $ 3.61 an hour , or 85 % of the minimum wage , in April 1991 .
Employers can pay the subminimum for 90 days , without restriction , to workers with less than six months of job experience , and for another 90 days if the company uses a government - certified training program for the young workers .
The training wage covers only workers who are 16 to 19 years old .
The White House previously insisted on an unrestricted six - month training wage that could be paid any time a worker of any age took a new job .
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce , still opposed to any mininum - wage increase , said the compromise plan to lift the wage floor 27 % in two stages between April 1990 and April 1991 `` will be impossible for many employers to accommodate and will result in the elimination of jobs for American workers and higher prices for American consumers .
J.P. Bolduc , vice chairman of W.R. Grace & Co. , which holds a 83.4 % interest in this energy - services company , was elected a director .
He succeeds Terrence D. Daniels , formerly a W.R. Grace vice chairman , who resigned .
W.R. Grace holds three of Grace Energy 's seven board seats .
Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. said it has reached an agreement in principle to buy buildings and related property in Albany , Ga. , from Bridgestone / Firestone Inc .
Terms were n't disclosed .
The tire maker said the buildings consist of 1.8 million square feet of office , manufacturing and warehousing space on 353 acres of land .
Hudson General Corp. 's president and chief executive officer , Alan J. Stearn , resigned .
Mr. Stearn , 46 years old , could n't be reached for comment .
A company spokesman declined to elaborate on the departure .
Hudson General , which provides maintenance , fueling and other services to airlines and airports , reported a loss for its most recent fiscal year and last month omitted the semiannual dividend on its common shares .
Mr. Stearn , who had been with the company more than 20 years and had been president since 1984 , will act as a consultant to Hudson General .
His duties as chief executive will be assumed by Chairman Jay B. Langner .
John R. Stevens , 49 years old , was named senior executive vice president and chief operating officer , both new positions .
He will continue to report to Donald Pardus , president and chief executive officer .
Mr. Stevens was executive vice president of this electric - utility holding company .
Arthur A. Hatch , 59 , was named executive vice president of the company .
He was previously president of the company 's Eastern Edison Co. unit .
John D. Carney , 45 , was named to succeed Mr. Hatch as president of Eastern Edison .
Previously he was vice president of Eastern Edison .
Robert P. Tassinari , 63 , was named senior vice president of Eastern Utilities .
He was previously vice president .
The federal government suspended sales of U.S. savings bonds because Congress has n't lifted the ceiling on government debt .
Until Congress acts , the government has n't any authority to issue new debt obligations of any kind , the Treasury said .
The government 's borrowing authority dropped at midnight Tuesday to $ 2.80 trillion from $ 2.87 trillion .
Legislation to lift the debt ceiling is ensnarled in the fight over cutting capital - gains taxes .
The House has voted to raise the ceiling to $ 3.1 trillion , but the Senate is n't expected to act until next week at the earliest .
The Treasury said the U.S. will default on Nov. 9 if Congress does n't act by then .
In reference to your Oct. 9 page - one article `` Barbara Bush Earns Even Higher Ratings Than the President , '' it is regrettable that you must continually define blacks by our negatives : `` Among liberals , 60 % have positive views of her , while 50 % approve of the president 's job performance .
In part , this may reflect the fact that ` she speaks a more progressive language ' than her husband , as Columbia 's Prof . -LCB- Ethel -RCB- Klein puts it .
Among professionals , 76 % have a favorable opinion of her , compared to 62 % who approve of her husband 's performance .
While a quarter of black voters disapprove of Mr. Bush 's handling of his job , only 15 % have a negative view of his spouse . ''
The statistics imply that three - quarters of blacks approve of Mr. Bush 's job performance and 85 % of blacks approve of Mrs. Bush .
If the assumption is that it is surprising that so few blacks find Mr. and Mrs. Bush distasteful , the positive view is even more newsworthy .
Such an editorial point of view perpetuates an insidious , stereotyped perspective .
Why are we blacks continually defined by our minority and the lowest common denominator .
Preston G. Foster Birmingham , Ala .
This is the year the negative ad , for years a secondary presence in most political campaigns , became the main event .
The irony is that the attack commercial , after getting a boost in last year 's presidential campaign , has come of age in an off - off election year with only a few contests scattered across the country .
But in the three leading political contests of 1989 , the negative ads have reached new levels of hostility , raising fears that this kind of mudslinging , empty of significant issues , is ushering in a new era of campaigns without content .
`` Now , '' says Joseph Napolitan , a pioneer in political television , `` the idea is to attack first , last and always . ''
A trend that started with the first stirrings of politics , accelerated with the dawn of the television age and became a sometimes - tawdry art form in 1988 , has reached an entirely new stage .
`` To get people 's attention these days , '' says Douglas Bailey , a political consultant , `` your TV ad needs to be bold and entertaining , and , more often than not , that means confrontational .
And , unlike a few years ago , you do n't even have to worry whether the ad is truthful . ''
In 1989 , as often as not , the principal fights in the major campaigns are prompted by the ads themselves .
Take a look , then , at the main attack commercials that set the tone for Tuesday 's elections in New York City , New Jersey and Virginia :
New York City :
The screen fills with a small , tight facial shot of David Dinkins , Democratic candidate for mayor of New York City .
`` David Dinkins failed to file his income taxes for four straight years , '' says a disembodied male voice .
And then this television commercial , paid for by Republican Rudolph Giuliani 's campaign and produced by Roger Ailes , the master of negative TV ads , really gets down to business .
Mr. Dinkins , the ad charges , also failed to report his campaign contributions accurately , hid his links to a failing insurance company and paid a convicted kidnapper `` through a phony organization with no members , no receipts and no office . ''
`` David Dinkins , '' says the kicker , `` Why does he always wait until he 's caught ? ''
`` Nasty innuendoes , '' says John Siegal , Mr. Dinkins 's issues director , `` designed to prosecute a case of political corruption that simply does n't exist . ''
Stung by the Giuliani ads , Mr. Dinkins 's TV consultants , Robert Shrum and David Doak , finally unleashed a negative ad of their own .
The screen shows two distorted , unrecognizable photos , presumably of two politicians .
`` Compare two candidates for mayor , '' says the announcer .
`` One says he 's for banning cop - killer bullets .
The other has opposed a ban on cop - killer bullets .
One claims he 's pro-choice .
The other has opposed a woman 's right to choose . ''
`` Funny thing , '' says the kicker , `` both these candidates are named Rudolph Giuliani . ''
Who 's telling the truth ?
Everybody -- and nobody .
It 's a classic situation of ads that are true but not always fully accurate .
Mr. Dinkins did fail to file his income taxes for four years , but he insists he voluntarily admitted the `` oversight '' when he was being considered for a city job .
He was on the board of an insurance company with financial problems , but he insists he made no secret of it .
The city 's Campaign Finance Board has refused to pay Mr. Dinkins $ 95,142 in matching funds because his campaign records are incomplete .
The campaign has blamed these reporting problems on computer errors .
And , says Mr. Dinkins , he did n't know the man his campaign paid for a get - out - the - vote effort had been convicted of kidnapping .
But , say Mr. Dinkins 's managers , he did have an office and his organization did have members .
Mr. Giuliani 's campaign chairman , Peter Powers , says the Dinkins ad is `` deceptive . ''
The other side , he argues , `` knows Giuliani has always been pro-choice , even though he has personal reservations .
They know he is generally opposed to cop - killer bullets , but that he had some reservations about the language in the legislation . ''
Virginia :
Democratic Lt. Gov. Douglas Wilder opened his gubernatorial battle with Republican Marshall Coleman with an abortion commercial produced by Frank Greer that analysts of every political persuasion agree was a tour de force .
Against a shot of Monticello superimposed on an American flag , an announcer talks about the `` strong tradition of freedom and individual liberty '' that Virginians have nurtured for generations .
Then , just as an image of the statue of Thomas Jefferson dissolves from the screen , the announcer continues : `` On the issue of abortion , Marshall Coleman wants to take away your right to choose and give it to the politicians . ''
That commercial -- which said Mr. Coleman wanted to take away the right of abortion `` even in cases of rape and incest , '' a charge Mr. Coleman denies -- changed the dynamics of the campaign , transforming it , at least in part , into a referendum on abortion .
The ad prompted Mr. Coleman , the former Virginia attorney general , to launch a series of advertisements created by Bob Goodman and designed to shake Mr. Wilder 's support among the very women who were attracted by the abortion ad .
The Coleman counterattack featured a close - up of a young woman in shadows and the ad suggested that she was recalling an unpleasant courtroom ordeal .
A voice says , `` C'mon , now , do n't you have boyfriends ? ''
Then an announcer interjects : `` It was Douglas Wilder who introduced a bill to force rape victims age 13 and younger to be interrogated about their private lives by lawyers for accused rapists .
So the next time Mr. Wilder talks about the rights of women , ask him about this law he tried to pass . ''
Mr. Wilder did introduce such legislation 17 years ago , but he did so at the request of a constituent , a common legislative technique used by lawmakers .
The legislation itself noted that it was introduced `` by request , '' and in 1983 Mr. Wilder introduced a bill to protect rape victims from unfounded interrogation .
`` People have grown tired of these ads and Coleman has gotten the stigma of being a negative campaigner , '' says Mark Rozell , a political scientist at Mary Washington College .
`` Wilder has managed to get across the idea that Coleman will say anything to get elected governor and -- more important -- has been able to put the onus for all the negative campaigning on Coleman . ''
Mr. Coleman said this week that he would devote the remainder of the political season to positive campaigning , but the truce lasted only hours .
By Tuesday night , television stations were carrying new ads featuring Mr. Coleman himself raising questions about Mr. Wilder 's sensitivity to rape victims .
New Jersey :
The attacks began when Democratic Rep. James Florio aired an ad featuring a drawing of Pinocchio and a photograph of Mr. Florio 's rival , Republican Rep. Jim Courter .
`` Remember Pinocchio ? '' says a female voice .
`` Consider Jim Courter . ''
And then this commercial , produced by Bob Squier , gets down to its own mean and dirty business .
Pictures of rusted oil drums swim into focus , and the female voice purrs , `` That hazardous waste on his -LCB- Mr. Courter 's -RCB- property -- the neighbors are suing for consumer fraud . ''
And the nose on Mr. Courter 's face grows .
The only fraud involved , cry Mr. Courter 's partisans , is the Florio commercial itself , and so the Courter campaign has responded with its own Pinocchio commercial , produced by Mr. Ailes .
In this one , the screen fills with photographs of both candidates .
`` Who 's really lying ? '' asks a female voice .
`` Florio 's lying , '' the voice goes on , because `` the barrel on Courter 's land ... contained heating oil , was cleaned up and caused no pollution . ''
Mr. Courter 's long nose shrinks while Mr. Florio 's grows .
Who 's telling the truth ?
Stephen Salmore , a political scientist at New Jersey 's Eagleton Institute , says it 's another example of an ad that 's true but not fully accurate .
Barrels were dumped on the Courter property , a complaint was made , but there is no evidence the barrels were a serious threat to the environment .
Even so , according to Mr. Salmore , the ad was `` devastating '' because it raised questions about Mr. Courter 's credibility .
But it 's building on a long tradition .
In 1966 , on route to a re-election rout of Democrat Frank O'Connor , GOP Gov. Nelson Rockefeller of New York appeared in person saying , `` If you want to keep the crime rates high , O'Connor is your man . ''
Lancaster Colony Corp. said it acquired Reames Foods Inc. in a cash transaction .
Terms were n't disclosed .
Reames , a maker and marketer of frozen noodles and pre-cooked pasta based in Clive , Iowa , has annual sales of about $ 11 million , Lancaster said .
F.H. Faulding & Co. , an Australian pharmaceuticals company , said its Moleculon Inc. affiliate acquired Kalipharma Inc. for $ 23 million .
Kalipharma is a New Jersey - based pharmaceuticals concern that sells products under the Purepac label .
Faulding said it owns 33 % of Moleculon 's voting stock and has an agreement to acquire an additional 19 % .
That stake , together with its convertible preferred stock holdings , gives Faulding the right to increase its interest to 70 % of Moleculon 's voting stock .
Norman Ricken , 52 years old and former president and chief operating officer of Toys `` R '' Us Inc. , and Frederick Deane Jr. , 63 , chairman of Signet Banking Corp. , were elected directors of this consumer electronics and appliances retailing chain .
They succeed Daniel M. Rexinger , retired Circuit City executive vice president , and Robert R. Glauber , U.S. Treasury undersecretary , on the 12 - member board .
The art of change - ringing is peculiar to the English , and , like most English peculiarities , unintelligible to the rest of the world .
-- Dorothy L. Sayers , `` The Nine Tailors ''
ASLACTON , England
-- Of all scenes that evoke rural England , this is one of the loveliest : An ancient stone church stands amid the fields , the sound of bells cascading from its tower , calling the faithful to evensong .
The parishioners of St. Michael and All Angels stop to chat at the church door , as members here always have .
In the tower , five men and women pull rhythmically on ropes attached to the same five bells that first sounded here in 1614 .
But there is also a discordant , modern note in Aslacton , though it ca n't be heard by the church - goers enjoying the peal of bells this cool autumn evening .
Like most of the other 6,000 churches in Britain with sets of bells , St. Michael once had its own `` band '' of ringers , who would herald every Sunday morning and evening service .
Now , only one local ringer remains : 64 - year - old Derek Hammond .
The others here today live elsewhere .
They belong to a group of 15 ringers -- including two octogenarians and four youngsters in training -- who drive every Sunday from church to church in a sometimes - exhausting effort to keep the bells sounding in the many belfries of East Anglia .
`` To ring for even one service at this tower , we have to scrape , '' says Mr. Hammond , a retired water - authority worker .
`` We 've tried to train the youngsters , but they have their discos and their dances , and they just drift away . ''
Mr. Hammond worries that old age and the flightiness of youth will diminish the ranks of the East Anglian group that keeps the Aslacton bells pealing .
History , after all , is not on his side .
According to a nationwide survey taken a year ago , nearly a third of England 's church bells are no longer rung on Sundays because there is no one to ring them .
It is easy to see why the ancient art is on the ropes .
The less complicated version of playing tunes on bells , as do the carillons of continental Europe , is considered by the English to be childish , fit only for foreigners .
Change - ringing , a mind - boggling exercise the English invented 380 years ago , requires physical dexterity -- some bells weigh more than a ton -- combined with intense mental concentration .
Proper English bells are started off in `` rounds , '' from the highest - pitched bell to the lowest -- a simple descending scale using , in larger churches , as many as 12 bells .
Then , at a signal , the ringers begin varying the order in which the bells sound without altering the steady rhythm of the striking .
Each variation , or change , can occur only once , the rules state .
Ringers memorize patterns of changes , known as `` methods , '' which have odd - sounding names like Kent Treble Bob Major or Grandsire Caters .
A series of 5,000 or so changes is a `` peal '' and takes about three hours .
A look at a Thursday night practice at St. Mary Abbot church in the Kensington district of London gives an idea of the work involved .
Ten shirt - sleeved ringers stand in a circle , one foot ahead of the other in a prize - fighter 's stance , each pulling a rope that disappears through a small hole in the high ceiling of the ringing chamber .
No one speaks , and the snaking of the ropes seems to make as much sound as the bells themselves , muffled by the ceiling .
Totally absorbed , the ringers stare straight ahead , using peripheral vision -LRB- they call it `` rope - sight '' -RRB- to watch the other ropes and thus time their pulls .
Far above in the belfry , the huge bronze bells , mounted on wheels , swing madly through a full 360 degrees , starting and ending , surprisingly , in the inverted , or mouth - up position .
Skilled ringers use their wrists to advance or retard the next swing , so that one bell can swap places with another in the following change .
In a well - known detective - story involving church bells , English novelist Dorothy L. Sayers described ringing as a `` passion -LCB- that -RCB- finds its satisfaction in mathematical completeness and mechanical perfection . ''
Ringers , she added , are `` filled with the solemn intoxication that comes of intricate ritual faultlessly performed . ''
`` Ringing does become a bit of an obsession , '' admits Stephanie Pattenden , master of the band at St. Mary Abbot and one of England 's best female ringers .
It is a passion that usually stays in the tower , however .
More often than not , ringers think of the church as something stuck on the bottom of the belfry .
When their changes are completed , and after they have worked up a sweat , ringers often skip off to the local pub , leaving worship for others below .
This does not sit well with some clerics .
With membership of the Church of England steadily dwindling , strong - willed vicars are pressing equally strong - willed and often non-religious ringers to attend services .
Two years ago , the Rev. Jeremy Hummerstone , vicar of Great Torrington , Devon , got so fed up with ringers who did n't attend service he sacked the entire band ; the ringers promptly set up a picket line in protest .
`` They were a self - perpetuating club that treated the tower as sort of a separate premises , '' the Vicar Hummerstone says .
An entirely new band rings today at Great Torrington , several of whom are members of the congregation .
But there still are n't enough ringers to ring more than six of the eight bells .
At St. Mary 's Church in Ilminster , Somerset , the bells have fallen silent following a dust - up over church attendance .
The vicar , W.D. Jones , refuses to talk about it , saying it would `` reopen the wound . ''
But C.J.B. Marshall , vicar of a nearby church , feels the fault is in the stairs from the bell tower that are located next to the altar .
`` So crunch , crunch , crunch , bang , bang , bang -- here come the ringers from above , making a very obvious exit while the congregation is at prayer , '' he says .
Vicar Marshall admits to mixed feelings about this issue , since he is both a vicar and an active bell - ringer himself .
`` The sound of bells is a net to draw people into the church , '' he says .
`` I live in hopes that the ringers themselves will be drawn into that fuller life . ''
The Central Council of Church Bell Ringers , a sort of parliament of ringing groups , aims to improve relations with vicars , says John C. Baldwin , president .
It hopes to speak to students at theological colleges about the joys of bell ringing and will shortly publish a booklet for every vicar in the country entitled , `` The Bells in Your Care . ''
Says Mr. Baldwin , `` We recognize that we may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience . ''
Mr. Baldwin is also attacking the greater problem : lack of ringers .
One survey says that of the 100,000 trained bellringers in England today , only 40,000 of them still ring .
Also , ringers do n't always live where the bells need to be rung -- like in small , rural parishes and inner - city churches .
But the council 's program to attract and train ringers is only partly successful , says Mr. Baldwin .
`` Right now , we 're lucky if after five years we keep one new ringer out of 10 , '' he adds .
One bright sign is that a growing number of women have entered the once male - dominated field ; more than a third of the ringers today are women .
They are n't accepted everywhere , however .
The oldest bell - ringing group in the country , the Ancient Society of College Youths , founded in 1637 , remains male - only , a fact that 's particularly galling to women because the group is the sole source of ringers for Britain 's most prestigious churches , St. Paul 's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey .
This being Britain , no woman has filed an equal - opportunity suit , but the extent of the problem surfaced this summer in a series of letters to `` The Ringing World , '' a weekly newspaper for ringers .
One writer , signing his letter as `` Red - blooded , balanced male , '' remarked on the `` frequency of women fainting in peals , '' and suggested that they `` settle back into their traditional role of making tea at meetings . ''
In the torrent of replies that followed , one woman ringer from Solihull observed that `` the average male ringer leaves quite a lot to be desired : badly dressed , decorated with acne and a large beer - belly , frequently unwashed and unbearably flatulent in peals . ''
Another women wrote from Sheffield to say that in her 60 years of ringing , `` I have never known a lady to faint in the belfry .
I have seen one or two men die , bless them .
Alleghany Corp. said it completed the acquisition of Sacramento Savings & Loan Association from the H.N. & Frances C. Berger Foundation for $ 150 million .
The Sacramento - based S&L , which has 44 branch offices in north central California , had assets of $ 2.4 billion at the end of September .
New York - based Alleghany is an insurance and financial services concern .
The purchase price includes two ancillary companies .
When Warren Winiarski , proprietor of Stag 's Leap Wine Cellars in Napa Valley , announced a $ 75 price tag for his 1985 Cask 23 Cabernet this fall , few wine shops and restaurants around the country balked .
`` This is the peak of my wine - making experience , '' Mr. Winiarski declared when he introduced the wine at a dinner in New York , `` and I wanted to single it out as such . ''
It is in my estimation the best wine Stag 's Leap has produced , and with fewer than 700 cases available , it is sure to sell quickly .
The price is a new high for California Cabernet Sauvignon , but it is not the highest .
Diamond Creek 1985 Lake Vineyard Cabernet weighed in this fall with a sticker price of $ 100 a bottle .
One of the fastest growing segments of the wine market is the category of superpremiums -- wines limited in production , of exceptional quality -LRB- or so perceived , at any rate -RRB- , and with exceedingly high prices .
For years , this group included a stable of classics -- Bordeaux first growths -LRB- Lafite - Rothschild , Latour , Haut - Brion , Petrus -RRB- , Grand Cru Burgundies -LRB- Romanee - Conti and La Tache -RRB- deluxe Champagnes -LRB- Dom Perignon or Roederer Cristal -RRB- , rarefied sweet wines -LRB- Chateau Yquem or Trockenbeerenauslesen Rieslings from Germany , and Biondi - Santi Brunello Riserva from Tuscany -RRB- .
These first magnitude wines ranged in price from $ 40 to $ 125 a bottle .
In the last year or so , however , this exclusive club has taken in a host of flashy new members .
The classics have zoomed in price to meet the competition , and it almost seems that there 's a race on to come up with the priciest single bottle , among current releases from every major wine region on the globe .
France can boast the lion 's share of high - priced bottles .
Bordeaux 's first growths from 1985 and 1986 are $ 60 to $ 80 each -LRB- except for the smallest in terms of production , Chateau Petrus , which costs around $ 250 ! -RRB- .
These prices seem rather modest , however , in light of other French wines from current vintages .
Chateau Yquem , the leading Sauternes , now goes for well over $ 100 a bottle for a lighter vintage like 1984 ; the spectacularly rich 1983 runs $ 179 .
In Champagne , some of the prestige cuvees are inching toward $ 100 a bottle .
The first Champagne to crack that price barrier was the 1979 Salon de Mesnil Blanc de Blancs .
The '82 Salon is $ 115 .
Roederer Cristal at $ 90 a bottle sells out around the country and Taittinger 's Comtes de Champagne Blanc de Blancs is encroaching upon that level .
The great reds of the Rhone Valley have soared in price as well .
E. Guigal 's 1982 Cote Rotie La Landonne , for example , is $ 120 .
None of France 's wine regions can steal a march on Burgundy , however .
The six wines of the Domaine de la Romanee - Conti , 72 of the most precious acres of vineyard anywhere in the world , have commanded three - digit price tags for several years now .
With the 1985 vintage , they soared higher : La Tache , $ 195 ; Richebourg , $ 180 ; Romanee - Conti , $ 225 .
Another small Burgundy estate , Coche - Dury , has just offered its 1987 Corton - Charlemagne for $ 155 .
From Italy there is Angelo Gaja Barbaresco at $ 125 a bottle , Piero Antinori 's La Solaia , a $ 90 Cabernet from Tuscany , and Biondi - Santi Brunello at $ 98 .
Spain 's Vega Secilia Unico 1979 -LRB- released only in its 10th year -RRB- is $ 70 , as is Australia 's Grange Hermitage 1982 .
`` There are certain cult wines that can command these higher prices , '' says Larry Shapiro of Marty 's , one of the largest wine shops in Dallas .
`` What 's different is that it is happening with young wines just coming out .
We 're seeing it partly because older vintages are growing more scarce . ''
Wine auctions have almost exhausted the limited supply of those wines , Mr. Shapiro continued : `` We 've seen a dramatic decrease in demand for wines from the '40s and '50s , which go for $ 300 to $ 400 a bottle .
Some of the newer wines , even at $ 90 to $ 100 a bottle or so , almost offer a bargain . ''
Take Lake Vineyard Cabernet from Diamond Creek .
It 's made only in years when the grapes ripen perfectly -LRB- the last was 1979 -RRB- and comes from a single acre of grapes that yielded a mere 75 cases in 1987 .
Owner Al Brownstein originally planned to sell it for $ 60 a bottle , but when a retailer in Southern California asked , `` Is that wholesale or retail ? '' he re-thought the matter .
Offering the wine at roughly $ 65 a bottle wholesale -LRB- $ 100 retail -RRB- , he sent merchants around the country a form asking them to check one of three answers : 1 -RRB- no , the wine is too high -LRB- 2 responses -RRB- ; 2 -RRB- yes , it 's high but I 'll take it -LRB- 2 responses -RRB- ; 3 -RRB- I 'll take all I can get -LRB- 58 responses -RRB- .
The wine was shipped in six - bottle cases instead of the usual 12 , but even at that it was spread thin , going to 62 retailers in 28 states .
`` We thought it was awfully expensive , '' said Sterling Pratt , wine director at Schaefer 's in Skokie , Ill. , one of the top stores in suburban Chicago , `` but there are people out there with very different opinions of value .
We got our two six - packs -- and they 're gone . ''
Mr. Pratt remarked that he thinks steeper prices have come about because producers do n't like to see a hit wine dramatically increase in price later on .
Even if there is consumer resistance at first , a wine that wins high ratings from the critics will eventually move .
`` There may be sticker - shock reaction initially , '' said Mr. Pratt , `` but as the wine is talked about and starts to sell , they eventually get excited and decide it 's worth the astronomical price to add it to their collection . ''
`` It 's just sort of a one - upsmanship thing with some people , '' added Larry Shapiro .
`` They like to talk about having the new Red Rock Terrace -LCB- one of Diamond Creek 's Cabernets -RCB- or the Dunn 1985 Cabernet , or the Petrus .
Producers have seen this market opening up and they 're now creating wines that appeal to these people . ''
That explains why the number of these wines is expanding so rapidly .
But consumers who buy at this level are also more knowledgeable than they were a few years ago .
`` They wo n't buy if the quality is not there , '' said Cedric Martin of Martin Wine Cellar in New Orleans .
`` Or if they feel the wine is overpriced and they can get something equally good for less . ''
Mr. Martin has increased prices on some wines -LRB- like Grgich Hills Chardonnay , now $ 32 -RRB- just to slow down movement , but he is beginning to see some resistance to high - priced red Burgundies and Cabernets and Chardonnays in the $ 30 to $ 40 range .
Image has , of course , a great deal to do with what sells and what does n't , and it ca n't be forced .
Wine merchants ca n't keep Roederer Cristal in stock , but they have to push Salon le Mesnil , even lowering the price from $ 115 to $ 90 .
It 's hardly a question of quality -- the 1982 Salon is a beautiful wine , but , as Mr. Pratt noted , people have their own ideas about value .
It 's interesting to find that a lot of the expensive wines are n't always walking out the door .
In every major market in the U.S. , for instance , you can buy '86 La Tache or Richebourg , virtually all of the first growth Bordeaux -LRB- except Petrus -RRB- , as well as Opus One and Dominus from California and , at the moment , the Stag 's Leap 1985 Cask 23 .
With the biggest wine - buying period of the year looming as the holidays approach , it will be interesting to see how the superpremiums fare .
By January it should be fairly clear what 's hot -- and what 's not .

Oil production from Australia 's Bass Strait fields will be raised by 11,000 barrels a day to about 321,000 barrels with the launch of the Whiting field , the first of five small fields scheduled to be brought into production before the end of 1990 .
Esso Australia Ltd. , a unit of New York - based Exxon Corp. , and Broken Hill Pty. operate the fields in a joint venture .
Esso said the Whiting field started production Tuesday .
Output will be gradually increased until it reaches about 11,000 barrels a day .
The field has reserves of 21 million barrels .
Reserves for the five new fields total 50 million barrels .
The Perch and Dolphin fields are expected to start producing early next year , and the Seahorse and Tarwhine fields later next year .
Esso said the fields were developed after the Australian government decided in 1987 to make the first 30 million barrels from new fields free of excise tax .
Troubled NBI Inc. said it fired more than half its work force and is discontinuing its hardware business to focus on its software and service operations .
The ailing company , which has reported net losses for 16 consecutive quarters , said it wo n't manufacture network computer systems any more and will greatly reduce its costly direct sales force .
Altogether , NBI said it will eliminate 266 jobs at its Boulder headquarters , 176 field sales jobs and 50 jobs at its Canadian and United Kingdom headquarters .
The company 's work force will fall to about 400 people .
Stephen G. Jerritts , president and chief executive officer , said customers were n't willing to commit to an expensive NBI hardware systems because of the company 's financial troubles .
Further , he said , the company does n't have the capital needed to build the business over the next year or two .
`` We flat ran out of financing resources , '' Mr. Jerritts said .
`` We had to do something structurally and radically different . ''
As a result , he said NBI will focus on servicing its installed base of systems , trying to provide maintenance for other manufacturers and expanding its software business , using some of the applications it developed for its hardware .
The company currently offers a word - processing package for personal computers called Legend .
The company , which recently said it lacked the profits and capital to pay dividends on its Series A convertible preferred stock , said it has hired an investment banker to help it raise additional cash .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , NBI common closed at 93 cents a share , up 31 cents .
BRAMALEA Ltd. said it agreed to issue 100 million Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ 85.1 million -RRB- of 10.5 % senior debentures due Nov. 30 , 1999 , together with 100,000 bond purchase warrants .
The Toronto - based real estate concern said each bond warrant entitles the holder to buy C$ 1,000 principal amount of debentures at par plus accrued interest to the date of purchase .
The warrants expire Nov. 30 , 1990 .
The issue will be swapped into fixed - rate U.S. dollars at a rate the company said is less than 9 % ; a spokesman declined to elaborate .
Lead underwriters for the issue are Scotia McLeod Inc. and RBC Dominion Securities Inc. , both Toronto - based investment dealers .
Bramalea said it expects to complete the issue by the end of the month .
Japanese investors nearly single - handedly bought up two new mortgage securities - based mutual funds totaling $ 701 million , the U.S. Federal National Mortgage Association said .
The purchases show the strong interest of Japanese investors in U.S. mortgage - based instruments , Fannie Mae 's chairman , David O. Maxwell , said at a news conference .
He said more than 90 % of the funds were placed with Japanese institutional investors .
The rest went to investors from France and Hong Kong .
Earlier this year , Japanese investors snapped up a similar , $ 570 million mortgage - backed securities mutual fund .
That fund was put together by Blackstone Group , a New York investment bank .
The latest two funds were assembled jointly by Goldman , Sachs & Co. of the U.S. and Japan 's Daiwa Securities Co .
The new , seven - year funds -- one offering a fixed - rate return and the other with a floating - rate return linked to the London interbank offered rate -- offer two key advantages to Japanese investors .
First , they are designed to eliminate the risk of prepayment -- mortgage - backed securities can be retired early if interest rates decline , and such prepayment forces investors to redeploy their money at lower rates .
Second , they channel monthly mortgage payments into semiannual payments , reducing the administrative burden on investors .
By addressing those problems , Mr. Maxwell said , the new funds have become `` extremely attractive to Japanese and other investors outside the U.S. . ''
Such devices have boosted Japanese investment in mortgage - backed securities to more than 1 % of the $ 900 billion in such instruments outstanding , and their purchases are growing at a rapid rate .
They also have become large purchasers of Fannie Mae 's corporate debt , buying $ 2.4 billion in Fannie Mae bonds during the first nine months of the year , or almost a tenth of the total amount issued .
While worry grows about big Japanese investments in the U.S. , Japan 's big trading companies are rapidly increasing their stake in America 's smaller business .
For Japan , the controversial trend improves access to American markets and technology .
But for small American companies , it also provides a growing source of capital and even marketing help .
Take the deal with Candela Laser Corp. , a Wayland , Mass. , manufacturer of high - tech medical devices , which three years ago set its sights on Japan as an export market .
Partly to help clear the myriad obstacles facing any overseas company trying to penetrate Japan , tiny Candela turned to Mitsui & Co. , one of Japan 's largest trading companies , for investment .
In a joint - venture deal , Mitsui guided Candela through Tokyo 's bureaucratic maze .
It eventually secured Ministry of Health import approval for two Candela laser products -- one that breaks up kidney stones and another that treats skin lesions .
At last count , Candela had sold $ 4 million of its medical devices in Japan .
The deal also gave Mitsui access to a high - tech medical product .
`` They view this as a growth area so they went about it with a systematic approach , '' says Richard Olsen , a Candela vice president .
Indeed , for many Japanese trading companies , the favorite U.S. small business is one whose research and development can be milked for future Japanese use .
The Japanese companies bankroll many small U.S. companies with promising products or ideas , frequently putting their money behind projects that commercial banks wo n't touch .
Japanese companies have financed small and medium - sized U.S. firms for years , but in recent months , the pace has taken off .
In the first half of 1989 alone , Japanese corporations invested $ 214 million in minority positions in U.S. companies , a 61 % rise from the figure for all of 1987 , reports Venture Economics Inc .
The Needham , Mass. , concern tracks investments in new businesses .
In addition , of course , some of the Japanese investments involved outright purchase of small U.S. firms .
Heightened Japanese interest in American small business parallels an acceleration of investments giving Japanese companies control of large , highly visible U.S. corporations , such as Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc .
Only this week , it was announced that Mitsubishi Estate Co. had acquired a 51 % stake in Rockefeller Group , which owns New York 's prestigious Rockefeller Center .
While the small deals are far less conspicuous , they add to Japanese penetration of the U.S. market .
As the deals also improve Japanese access to American technology and market knowledge , they feed American anxieties in this area , too .
Even a low - tech product like plate glass can catch a trading company 's fancy if there 's a strategic fit .
Free State Glass Industries of Warrenton , Va. , a small fabricator of architectural glass , was foundering under its original management .
Last year , Mitsubishi International Corp. , the New York - based arm of Mitsubishi Corp. , bought controlling interest in the glass company in a joint venture with Ronald Bodner , a glass industry executive and Mitsubishi consultant .
The deal is chiefly designed to give Mitsubishi a window on the U.S. glass industry , says Ichiro Wakui , an executive in Mitsubishi 's general merchandise department in New York .
`` It 's not just a simple investment in a small company , '' Mr. Wakui says .
`` We want to see the glass market from the inside , not the outside . ''
Mitsubishi 's investment in Free State is `` very small ... less than $ 4 million , '' Mr. Wakui says .
Mr. Bodner declines to comment on the arrangement .
Trading companies such as Mitsubishi , Mitsui , C. Itoh & Co. and Nissho - Iwai Corp. , which make many of the Japanese investments in small U.S. concerns , have no U.S. counterpart .
These vertically integrated combines , some of which got their start in Japan 's feudal period , deal globally in commodities , construction and manufacturing .
They operate ships and banks .
`` All the `` sogo - shosha '' are looking for new business , '' says Arthur Klauser , adviser to the president of Mitsui , U.S.A. , using the Japanese term for the largest of the global trading houses .
Adds Takeshi Kondo , senior vice president of C. Itoh America Inc. : `` We have a great interest in making investments , particularly in new ventures . ''
A host of electronics firms in California 's Silicon Valley were financed with trading - company venture capital .
Profit , at least in the short term , is usually a secondary goal .
`` Strategic objectives , not financial return , drive many of the deals , '' says a Venture Economics spokesman .
In investing on the basis of future transactions , a role often performed by merchant banks , trading companies can cut through the logjam that small - company owners often face with their local commercial banks .
`` It 's the classic problem of the small businessman , '' says Malcolm Davies , managing director of Trading Alliance Corp. of New York .
`` People are queuing at the door to take his product but he does n't have the working capital to make the thing and commercial banks are very unsympathetic .
They want assets , they want a balance sheet , which has no relation to the business a company can generate . ''
Adds Mitsui 's Mr. Klauser : `` Unlike corporations in this country , trading companies are n't so much interested in a high return on investment as they are on increasing trade flows .
To the extent they can do this , they 're quite content to get a return on investment of 1 % to 2 % . ''
Mr. Klauser says Mitsui has 75 U.S. subsidiaries in which it holds 35 % interest or more and the trading company hopes to double the number of its U.S. affiliates in 1990 .
Sales by these subsidiaries in the fiscal year ending last March were more than $ 17 billion .
A 1 % to 2 % return on $ 17 billion `` ai n't hay , '' Mr. Klauser says .
Rudolph Agnew , 55 years old and former chairman of Consolidated Gold Fields PLC , was named a nonexecutive director of this British industrial conglomerate .
The U.S. and Soviet Union are holding technical talks about possible repayment by Moscow of $ 188 million in pre-Communist Russian debts owed to the U.S. government , the State Department said .
If the debts are repaid , it could clear the way for Soviet bonds to be sold in the U.S. .
However , after two meetings with the Soviets , a State Department spokesman said that it 's `` too early to say '' whether that will happen .
Coincident with the talks , the State Department said it has permitted a Soviet bank to open a New York branch .
The branch of the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs was approved last spring and opened in July .
But a Soviet bank here would be crippled unless Moscow found a way to settle the $ 188 million debt , which was lent to the country 's short - lived democratic Kerensky government before the Communists seized power in 1917 .
Under a 1934 law , the Johnson Debt Default Act , as amended , it 's illegal for Americans to extend credit to countries in default to the U.S. government , unless they are members of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund .
The U.S.S.R. belongs to neither organization .
Moscow has settled pre-1917 debts with other countries in recent years at less than face value .
The State Department stressed the pre-1933 debts as the key to satisfying the Johnson Act .
But the Soviets might still face legal obstacles to raising money in the U.S. until they settle hundreds of millions of dollars in additional debt still outstanding from the World War II lend - lease program .
`` The Cosby Show '' may have single - handedly turned around ratings at NBC since its debut in 1984 , and the Huxtable family still keeps millions of viewers laughing Thursday night on the network .
But some of the TV stations that bought `` Cosby '' reruns for record prices two years ago are n't laughing much these days .
The reruns have helped ratings at many of the 187 network affiliates and independent TV stations that air the shows .
But the ratings are considerably below expectations , and some stations say they may not buy new episodes when their current contracts expire .
Meanwhile , stations are fuming because , many of them say , the show 's distributor , Viacom Inc. , is giving an ultimatum : Either sign new long - term commitments to buy future episodes or risk losing `` Cosby '' to a competitor .
At the same time , Viacom is trying to persuade stations to make commitments to `` A Different World , '' a spin - off of `` Cosby '' whose reruns will become available in 1991 .
Viacom denies it 's using pressure tactics .
`` We 're willing to negotiate , '' says Dennis Gillespie , executive vice president of marketing .
`` We 're offering this plan now because we feel it 's the right time . ''
But , says the general manager of a network affiliate in the Midwest , `` I think if I tell them I need more time , they 'll take ` Cosby ' across the street , ''
Viacom 's move comes as the syndication market is being flooded with situation comedies that are still running on the networks .
One station manager says he believes Viacom 's move is a `` pre-emptive strike '' because the company is worried that `` Cosby '' ratings will continue to drop in syndication over the next few years .
`` Cosby '' is down a full ratings point in the week of Oct. 2 - 8 over the same week a year ago , according to A.C. Nielsen Co .
Mr. Gillespie at Viacom says the ratings are rising .
And executives at stations in such major markets as Washington ; Providence , R.I. ; Cleveland ; Raleigh , N.C. ; Minneapolis , and Louisville , Ky. , say they may very well not renew `` Cosby . ''
Dick Lobo , the general manager of WTVJ , the NBC - owned station in Miami , for example , says the show has `` been a major disappointment to us . ''
`` At the prices we were charged , there should have been some return for the dollar .
There was n't . ''
Neil Kuvin , the general manager of WHAS , the CBS affiliate in Louisville , says `` Cosby '' gets the station 's highest ratings and he 's `` pleased . ''
But he adds , `` I feel pressured , disappointed , uncomfortable and , frankly , quite angry with Viacom .
SHAREDATA Inc. said it will amend a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to delete a plan to sell 500,000 newly issued common shares .

The multilevel railcars , scheduled for delivery in 1990 , will be made by Thrall Manufacturing Co. , a Chicago Heights , Ill. , division of closely held Duchossois Industries Inc. , Elmhurst , Ill .
This year , the railroad holding company acquired 850 such railcars .
Copperweld Corp. , a specialty steelmaker , said 445 workers at a plant in Shelby , Ohio , began a strike after the United Steelworkers Local 3057 rejected a new contract on Tuesday .
The previous contract between Copperweld 's Ohio Steel Tube division and the union expired at midnight Tuesday .
The union vote to reject the proposed pact was 230 - 215 .
Copperweld said it does n't expect a protracted strike .
It said it has taken measures to continue shipments during the work stoppage .
Japanese investment in Southeast Asia is propelling the region toward economic integration .
Interviews with analysts and business people in the U.S. suggest that Japanese capital may produce the economic cooperation that Southeast Asian politicians have pursued in fits and starts for decades .
But Japan 's power in the region also is sparking fears of domination and posing fresh policy questions .
The flow of Japanese funds has set in motion `` a process whereby these economies will be knitted together by the great Japanese investment machine , '' says Robert Hormats , vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International Corp .
In the past five years , Japanese companies have tripled their commitments in Asia to $ 5.57 billion .
In Thailand , for example , the government 's Board of Investment approved $ 705.6 million of Japanese investment in 1988 , 10 times the U.S. investment figure for the year .
Japan 's commitment in Southeast Asia also includes steep increases in foreign assistance and trade .
Asia 's other cash - rich countries are following Japan 's lead and pumping capital into the region .
In Taiwan and South Korea , rising wages are forcing manufacturers to seek other overseas sites for labor - intensive production .
These nations , known as Asia 's `` little tigers , '' also are contributing to Southeast Asia 's integration , but their influence will remain subordinate to Japan 's .
For recipient countries such as Thailand and Malaysia , the investment will provide needed jobs and spur growth .
But Asian nations ' harsh memories of their military domination by Japan in the early part of this century make them fearful of falling under Japanese economic hegemony now .
Because of budget constraints in Washington , the U.S. encourages Japan to share economic burdens in the region .
But it resists yielding political ground .
In the coming decade , analysts say , U.S. - Japanese relations will be tested as Tokyo comes to terms with its new status as the region 's economic behemoth .
Japan 's swelling investment in Southeast Asia is part of its economic evolution .
In the past decade , Japanese manufacturers concentrated on domestic production for export .
In the 1990s , spurred by rising labor costs and the strong yen , these companies will increasingly turn themselves into multinationals with plants around the world .
To capture the investment , Southeast Asian nations will move to accommodate Japanese business .
These nations ' internal decisions `` will be made in a way not to offend their largest aid donor , largest private investor and largest lender , '' says Richard Drobnick , director of the international business and research program at the University of Southern California 's Graduate School of Business .
Japanese money will help turn Southeast Asia into a more cohesive economic region .
But , analysts say , Asian cooperation is n't likely to parallel the European Common Market approach .
Rather , Japanese investment will spur integration of certain sectors , says Kent Calder , a specialist in East Asian economies at the Woodrow Wilson School for Public and Internatonal Affairs at Princeton University .
In electronics , for example , a Japanese company might make television picture tubes in Japan , assemble the sets in Malaysia and export them to Indonesia .
`` The effect will be to pull Asia together not as a common market but as an integrated production zone , '' says Goldman Sachs 's Mr. Hormats .
Countries in the region also are beginning to consider a framework for closer economic and political ties .
The economic and foreign ministers of 12 Asian and Pacific nations will meet in Australia next week to discuss global trade issues as well as regional matters such as transportation and telecommunications .
Participants will include the U.S. , Australia , Canada , Japan , South Korea and New Zealand as well as the six members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations -- Thailand , Malaysia , Singapore , Indonesia , the Philippines and Brunei .
In addition , the U.S. this year offered its own plan for cooperation around the Pacific rim in a major speech by Secretary of State James Baker , following up a proposal made in January by Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke .
The Baker proposal reasserts Washington 's intention to continue playing a leading political role in the region .
`` In Asia , as in Europe , a new order is taking shape , '' Mr. Baker said .
`` The U.S. , with its regional friends , must play a crucial role in designing its architecture . ''
But maintaining U.S. influence will be difficult in the face of Japanese dominance in the region .
Japan not only outstrips the U.S. in investment flows but also outranks it in trade with most Southeast Asian countries -LRB- although the U.S. remains the leading trade partner for all of Asia -RRB- .
Moreover , the Japanese government , now the world 's largest aid donor , is pumping far more assistance into the region than the U.S. is .
While U.S. officials voice optimism about Japan 's enlarged role in Asia , they also convey an undertone of caution .
`` There 's an understanding on the part of the U.S. that Japan has to expand its functions '' in Asia , says J. Michael Farren , undersecretary of commerce for trade .
`` If they approach it with a benevolent , altruistic attitude , there will be a net gain for everyone . ''
Some Asian nations are apprehensive about Washington 's demand that Tokyo step up its military spending to ease the U.S. security burden in the region .
The issue is further complicated by uncertainty over the future of the U.S. 's leases on military bases in the Philippines and by a possible U.S. troop reduction in South Korea .
Many Asians regard a U.S. presence as a desirable counterweight to Japanese influence .
`` No one wants the U.S. to pick up its marbles and go home , '' Mr. Hormats says .
For their part , Taiwan and South Korea are expected to step up their own investments in the next decade to try to slow the Japanese juggernaut .
`` They do n't want Japan to monopolize the region and sew it up , '' says Chong - sik Lee , professor of East Asian politics at the University of Pennsylvania .
Japan 's domestic sales of cars , trucks and buses in October rose 18 % from a year earlier to 500,004 units , a record for the month , the Japan Automobile Dealers ' Association said .
The strong growth followed year - to - year increases of 21 % in August and 12 % in September .
The monthly sales have been setting records every month since March .
October sales , compared with the previous month , inched down 0.4 % .
Sales of passenger cars grew 22 % from a year earlier to 361,376 units .
Sales of medium - sized cars , which benefited from price reductions arising from introduction of the consumption tax , more than doubled to 30,841 units from 13,056 in October 1988 .
Argentina said it will ask creditor banks to halve its foreign debt of $ 64 billion -- the third - highest in the developing world .
The declaration by Economy Minister Nestor Rapanelli is believed to be the first time such an action has been called for by an Argentine official of such stature .
The Latin American nation has paid very little on its debt since early last year .
`` Argentina aspires to reach a reduction of 50 % in the value of its external debt , '' Mr. Rapanelli said through his spokesman , Miguel Alurralde .
Mr. Rapanelli met in August with U.S. Assistant Treasury Secretary David Mulford .
Argentine negotiator Carlos Carballo was in Washington and New York this week to meet with banks .
Mr. Rapanelli recently has said the government of President Carlos Menem , who took office July 8 , feels a significant reduction of principal and interest is the only way the debt problem may be solved .
But he has not said before that the country wants half the debt forgiven .
Program traders are fond of predicting that if they are blocked in the U.S. , they will simply emigrate to foreign stock markets .
But in London and Tokyo , where computer - driven trading now plays a small but growing role , traders say a number of hurdles loom .
Government officials , especially in Japan , probably would resist any onslaught of program trading by players trying to shrug off the U.S. furor over their activities and marching abroad with their business .
Japan is `` very concerned '' about the possible effects of program trading , a senior Japanese official said after the Oct. 13 stock plunge in New York .
U.S. stock - index futures are n't even traded in Japan now .
And because of the time difference , the Japanese and the U.S. markets ' trading hours do n't overlap .
It all adds up to a barrier to American - style index arbitrage , the most popular form of U.S. program trading that seeks to exploit brief differences between prices of stocks in New York and the price of a futures contract in Chicago based on those stocks .
About 11.6 % of all program trading by New York Stock Exchange firms in September took place in foreign markets , according to Big Board data .
Yet it is difficult to imagine Japan racing to introduce Chicago - style stock - index futures .
Japan 's Finance Ministry already is scrutinizing institutional investors ' activity to see whether policy changes are needed to cope with the current level of program trading , said Makato Utsumi , vice minister for international finance .
Program trading has taken off in Japan since last year 's introduction of home - market stock - index futures trading on the Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges .
But regulators are wary .
They have n't forgotten the leap in share prices last Dec. 7 , when the first bout of foreign - led index arbitrage drove stocks skyward in the last half - hour of trading , startling regulators who thought they had written enough rules to prevent such a swing .
Japan 's Finance Ministry had set up mechanisms to limit how far futures prices could fall in a single session and to give market operators the authority to suspend trading in futures at any time .
`` Maybe it was n't enough , '' a Finance Ministry official noted after the Dec. 7 surge .
Japan 's regulators have since tightened controls on index - related stock purchases .
Tokyo 's leading program traders are the big U.S. securities houses , though the Japanese are playing catch - up .
Some U.S. firms , notably Salomon Inc. and Morgan Stanley Group Inc. , have reaped a hefty chunk of their Japanese earnings from index arbitrage , both for customers and for their own accounts .
-LRB- Morgan Stanley last week joined a growing list of U.S. securities firms that have stopped doing index arbitrage for their own accounts . -RRB-
Both Deryck C. Maughan , who heads Salomon in Tokyo , and John S. Wadsworth , who heads Morgan Stanley there , ascribe a good part of their firms ' success in Tokyo to their ability to offer sophisticated , futures - related investment strategies to big institutional clients .
They do n't have plans to cut back .
`` It has not been disruptive in the markets here , '' Mr. Maughan said .
`` The real difference seems to be that the cash market here ... is big enough and liquid enough that the futures market is n't having the same impact it does in America . ''
The British also are scrutinizing program trades .
Index - arbitrage trading is `` something we want to watch closely , '' an official at London 's Stock Exchange said .
`` We do n't think there is cause for concern at the moment . ''
London serves increasingly as a conduit for program trading of U.S. stocks .
Market professionals said London has several attractions .
First , the trading is done over the counter and is n't reported on either the U.S. or London stock trading tapes .
Second , it can be used to unwind positions before U.S. trading begins , but at prices pegged to the previous session 's Big Board close .
In addition to the extra privacy of these trades , the transactions can often be less expensive to execute , because the parties do n't have to pay a floor brokerage fee or a specialist 's fee .
Still , `` Much less -LCB- index - arbitrage activity -RCB- is done over here than in the U.S. '' said Richard Barfield , chief investment manager at Standard Life Assurance Co. , which manages about # 15 billion -LRB- $ 23.72 billion -RRB- in United Kingdom institutional funds .
Britain has two main index - arbitrage instruments .
A Financial Times - Stock Exchange 100 - share index option contract is traded on the London Stock Exchange 's Traded Options Market .
And an FT - SE futures contract is traded on the London International Financial Futures Exchange .
Both contracts have gained a following since the 1987 global market crash .
The average number of FT - SE option contracts traded on the London exchange has surged nearly tenfold since the contract 's launch in 1984 .
This year , the average of daily contracts traded totaled 9,118 , up from 4,645 a year earlier and from 917 in 1984 .
But a survey early this summer indicated that the volume of index - options trading was only 15 % of the size of the underlying equity market , exchange officials said .
This compares with estimates that the U.S. `` derivatives '' market is perhaps four times as large as the underlying domestic market .
Yields on money - market mutual funds continued to slide , amid signs that portfolio managers expect further declines in interest rates .
The average seven - day compound yield of the 400 taxable funds tracked by IBC 's Money Fund Report eased a fraction of a percentage point to 8.45 % from 8.47 % for the week ended Tuesday .
Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that the current yield continues for a year .
Average maturity of the funds ' investments lengthened by a day to 41 days , the longest since early August , according to Donoghue 's .
Longer maturities are thought to indicate declining interest rates because they permit portfolio managers to retain relatively higher rates for a longer period .
Shorter maturities are considered a sign of rising rates because portfolio managers can capture higher rates sooner .
The average maturity for funds open only to institutions , considered by some to be a stronger indicator because those managers watch the market closely , reached a high point for the year -- 33 days .
Nevertheless , said Brenda Malizia Negus , editor of Money Fund Report , yields `` may blip up again before they blip down '' because of recent rises in short - term interest rates .
The yield on six - month Treasury bills sold at Monday 's auction , for example , rose to 8.04 % from 7.90 % .
Despite recent declines in yields , investors continue to pour cash into money funds .
Assets of the 400 taxable funds grew by $ 1.5 billion during the latest week , to $ 352.7 billion .
Typically , money - fund yields beat comparable short - term investments because portfolio managers can vary maturities and go after the highest rates .
The top money funds are currently yielding well over 9 % .
Dreyfus World - Wide Dollar , the top - yielding fund , had a seven - day compound yield of 9.37 % during the latest week , down from 9.45 % a week earlier .
It invests heavily in dollar - denominated securities overseas and is currently waiving management fees , which boosts its yield .
The average seven - day simple yield of the 400 funds was 8.12 % , down from 8.14 % .
The 30 - day simple yield fell to an average 8.19 % from 8.22 % ; the 30 - day compound yield slid to an average 8.53 % from 8.56 % .
Japan 's reserves of gold , convertible foreign currencies , and special drawing rights fell by a hefty $ 1.82 billion in October to $ 84.29 billion , the Finance Ministry said .
The total marks the sixth consecutive monthly decline .
The protracted downturn reflects the intensity of Bank of Japan yen - support intervention since June , when the U.S. currency temporarily surged above the 150.00 yen level .
The announcement follows a sharper $ 2.2 billion decline in the country 's foreign reserves in September to $ 86.12 billion .
Sir Peter Walters , 58 - year - old chairman of British Petroleum Co. until next March , joins the board of this cement products company on Dec. 1 .
Sir Peter will succeed Sir John Milne , 65 , who retires as Blue Circle nonexecutive chairman on June 1 .
Fujitsu Ltd. 's top executive took the unusual step of publicly apologizing for his company 's making bids of just one yen for several local government projects , while computer rival NEC Corp. made a written apology for indulging in the same practice .
Meanwhile , business and government leaders rebuked the computer makers , and fretted about the broader statement the companies ' actions make about Japanese cutthroat pricing .
Fujitsu said it bid the equivalent of less than a U.S. penny on three separate municipal contracts during the past two years .
The company also disclosed that during that period it offered 10,000 yen , or about $ 70 , for another contract .
But Fujitsu , Japan 's No. 1 computer maker , is n't alone .
NEC , one of its largest domestic competitors , said it bid one yen in two separate public auctions since 1987 .
In both cases , NEC lost the contract to Fujitsu , which made the same bid and won a tie - breaking lottery .
All the contracts were for computer - system - design contracts and involved no hardware or software .
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry summoned executives from the companies to `` make sure they understood '' the concern about such practices , according to a government spokesman .
`` These cases lead to the loss of the firms ' social and international credibility , '' a ministry statement said .
Japan 's Fair Trade Commission has said it is considering investigating the bids for possible antitrust - law violations .
`` We would like to apologize for having caused huge trouble , '' Fujitsu President Takuma Yamamoto , read from a prepared statement as he stood before a packed news conference at his company 's downtown headquarters .
The bids , he added , were `` contrary to common sense . ''
NEC released a statement saying , `` We feel sorry for having caused trouble to society , '' a form of apology common in Japan for companies caught in embarrassing situations .
Japanese companies have long had a reputation for sacrificing short - term profits to make a sale that may have long - term benefits .
But the growing controversy comes as many practices historically accepted as normal here -- such as politicians accepting substantial gifts from businessmen or having extramarital affairs -- are coming under close ethical scrutiny .
The fire is also fueled by growing international interest in Japanese behavior .
So far there have been no public overseas complaints about the issue .
But in one of the auctions in question , International Business Machines Corp. made a bid substantially higher than the Fujitsu offer , according to the municipality .
The low - ball bids touch on issues central to the increasingly tense trade debate .
Foreigners complain that they have limited access to government procurement in Japan , in part because Japanese companies unfairly undercut them .
The U.S. government in recent years has accused Japanese companies of excessively slashing prices on semiconductors and supercomputers -- products Fujitsu and NEC make .
Asked whether the bidding flap would hurt U.S. - Japan relations , Mr. Yamamoto said , `` this will be a minus factor . ''
The `` one - yen '' controversy first came to a head last week when the city of Hiroshima announced that Fujitsu won a contract to design a computer system to map its waterworks .
The city had expected to pay about 11 million yen -LRB- $ 77,000 -RRB- , but Fujitsu essentially offered to do it for free .
Then Wednesday , Fujitsu said it made a similar bid to win a library contract in Nagano prefecture two weeks earlier .
It also said that in July , it bid 10,000 yen to design a system for the Saitama prefectural library , and two years ago , it bid one yen to plan the telecommunications system for Wakayama prefecture .
The company said it has offered to withdraw its bids in Hiroshima and Nagano .
The municipalities said they have n't decided whether to try to force the company to go through with the contracts .
Fujitsu and NEC said they were still investigating , and that knowledge of more such bids could emerge .
Mr. Yamamoto insisted that headquarters had n't approved the bids , and that he did n't know about most of the cases until Wednesday .
Other major Japanese computer companies contacted yesterday said they have never made such bids .
`` One yen is not ethical , '' Michio Sasaki , an official at Keidanren , the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations , said .
`` Profit may be low , but at least costs should be covered .
Zenith Data Systems Corp. , a subsidiary of Zenith Electronics Corp. , received a $ 534 million Navy contract for software and services of microcomputers over an 84 - month period .
Rockwell International Corp. won a $ 130.7 million Air Force contract for AC - 130U gunship replacement aircraft .
Martin Marietta Corp. was given a $ 29.9 million Air Force contract for low - altitude navigation and targeting equipment .
Federal Data Corp. got a $ 29.4 million Air Force contract for intelligence data handling .
For 10 years , Genie Driskill went to her neighborhood bank because it was convenient .
A high - balance customer that banks pine for , she did n't give much thought to the rates she was receiving , nor to the fees she was paying .
But in August , First Atlanta National Bank introduced its Crown Account , a package designed to lure customers such as Ms. Driskill .
Among other things , it included checking , safe deposit box and credit card -- all for free -- plus a good deal on installment loans .
All she had to do was put $ 15,000 in a certificate of deposit , or qualify for a $ 10,000 personal line of credit .
`` I deserve something for my loyalty , '' she says .
She took her business to First Atlanta .
So it goes in the competitive world of consumer banking these days .
For nearly a decade , banks have competed for customers primarily with the interest rates they pay on their deposits and charge on their loans .
The competitive rates were generally offset by hefty fees on various services .
But many banks are turning away from strict price competition .
Instead , they are trying to build customer loyalty by bundling their services into packages and targeting them to small segments of the population .
`` You 're dead in the water if you are n't segmenting the market , '' says Anne Moore , president of Synergistics Research Corp. , a bank consulting firm in Atlanta .
NCNB Corp. of Charlotte , N.C. , recently introduced its Financial Connections Program aimed at young adults just starting careers .
The program not only offers a pre-approved car loan up to $ 18,000 , but throws in a special cash - flow statement to help in saving money .
In September , Union Planters Corp. of Memphis , Tenn. , launched The Edge account , a package designed for the `` thirtysomething '' crowd with services that include a credit card and line of credit with no annual fees , and a full percentage point off on installment loans .
The theory : Such individuals , many with young children , are in their prime borrowing years -- and , having borrowed from the bank , they may continue to use it for other services in later years .
For some time , banks have been aiming packages at the elderly , the demographic segment with the highest savings .
Those efforts are being stepped up .
Judie MacDonald , vice president of retail sales at Barnett Banks Inc. of Jacksonville , Fla. , says the company now targets sub-segments within the market by tailoring its popular Seniors Partners Program to various life styles .
`` Varying age , geography and life - style differences create numerous sub-markets , '' Ms. MacDonald says .
She says individual Barnett branches can add different benefits to their Seniors Partners package -- such as athletic activities or travel clubs -- to appeal to local market interests .
`` An active 55 - year - old in Boca Raton may care more about Senior Olympic games , while a 75 - year - old in Panama City may care more about a seminar on health , '' she says .
Banks have tried packaging before .
In 1973 , Wells Fargo & Co. of San Francisco launched the Gold Account , which included free checking , a credit card , safe - deposit box and travelers checks for a $ 3 monthly fee .
The concept begot a slew of copycats , but the banks stopped promoting the packages .
One big reason : thin margins .
Many banks , particularly smaller ones , were slow to computerize and could n't target market niches that would have made the programs more profitable .
As banks ' earnings were squeezed in the mid-1970s , the emphasis switched to finding ways to cut costs .
But now computers are enabling more banks to analyze their customers by age , income and geography .
They are better able to get to those segments in the wake of the deregulation that began in the late 1970s .
Deregulation has effectively removed all restrictions on what banks can pay for deposits , as well as opened up the field for new products such as high - rate CDs .
Where a bank once offered a standard passbook savings account , it began offering money - market accounts , certificates of deposit and interest - bearing checking , and staggering rates based on the size of deposits .
The competition has grown more intense as bigger banks such as Norwest Corp. of Minneapolis and Chemical Banking Corp. of New York extend their market - share battles into small towns across the nation .
`` Today , a banker is worrying about local , regional and money - center -LCB- banks -RCB- , as well as thrifts and credit unions , '' says Ms. Moore at Synergistics Research .
`` So people who were n't even thinking about targeting 10 years ago are scrambling to define their customer base . ''
The competition has cultivated a much savvier consumer .
`` The average household will spread 19 accounts over a dozen financial institutions , '' says Michael P. Sullivan , who runs his own bank consulting firm in Charlotte , N.C .
`` This much fragmentation makes attracting and keeping today 's rate - sensitive customers costly . ''
Packages encourage loyalty by rewarding customers for doing the bulk of their banking in one place .
For their troubles , the banks get a larger captive audience that is less likely to move at the drop of a rate .
The more accounts customers have , Mr. Sullivan says , the more likely they are to be attracted to a package -- and to be loyal to the bank that offers it .
That can pay off down the road as customers , especially the younger ones , change from borrowers to savers / investors .
Packaging has some drawbacks .
The additional technology , personnel training and promotional effort can be expensive .
Chemical Bank spent more than $ 50 million to introduce its ChemPlus line , several packages aimed at different segments , in 1986 , according to Thomas Jacob , senior vice president of marketing .
`` It 's not easy to roll out something that comprehensive , and make it pay , '' Mr. Jacob says .
Still , bankers expect packaging to flourish , primarily because more customers are demanding that financial services be tailored to their needs .
`` These days , banking customers walk in the door expecting you to have a package especially for them , '' Ms. Moore says .
Some banks are already moving in that direction , according to Alvin T. Sale , marketing director at First Union Corp. in Charlotte .
First Union , he says , now has packages for seven customer groups .
Soon , it will split those into 30 .
Says Mr. Sale : `` I think more banks are starting to realize that we have to be more like the department store , not the boutique . ''
IRAs .
Your Oct. 6 article `` Japan 's Financial Firms Lure Science Graduates '' states , `` Industrial companies are accusing financial institutions of jeopardizing Japan 's economy by raising the salary stakes for new employees . ''
The Japanese industrial companies should know better .
They are barking up the wrong tree , because it is basically their fault they ca n't attract new employees .
Takuma Yamamoto , president of Fujitsu Ltd. , believes `` the ` money worship ' among young people ... caused the problem . ''
He is just passing the buck to young people .
What 's wrong with asking for more money ?
Money is not everything , but it is necessary , and business is not volunteer work .
It is not unethical to choose a higher - salaried job .
Unfortunately , Japanese manufacturers have neither good working conditions nor good compensation packages .
I get the impression that some Japanese managers believe working harder for less money is beautiful .
I visited a lot of major Japanese manufacturers , but I never felt I would want to be employed by any of them .
Many of them recently have been spending a lot of money on public relations and advertising to improve their images , but they should realize that the most important thing is real change , not changing people 's perceptions .
If the Japanese companies are seriously considering their survival , they could do at least three things to improve the situation : raise salaries higher than those of financial institutions ; improve working conditions -LRB- better offices and more vacations , for example -RRB- ; accept and hire more labor from outside Japan .

Clark J. Vitulli was named senior vice president and general manager of this U.S. sales and marketing arm of Japanese auto maker Mazda Motor Corp .
In the new position he will oversee Mazda 's U.S. sales , service , parts and marketing operations .
Previously , Mr. Vitulli , 43 years old , was general marketing manager of Chrysler Corp. 's Chrysler division .
He had been a sales and marketing executive with Chrysler for 20 years .
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said it plans to institute an additional `` circuit breaker '' aimed at stemming market slides .
Separately , John Phelan told a closed House subcommittee meeting in Washington that he would support Securities and Exchange Commission halts of program trading during market emergencies .
But the New York Stock Exchange chairman said he does n't support reinstating a `` collar '' on program trading , arguing that firms could get around such a limit .
The Chicago Merc said a new one - hour price limit would take effect in its Standard & Poor 's 500 stock - index futures pit once S&P 500 futures fell 20 index points -- the equivalent of about a 150 - point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
If the 20 - point limit is triggered after 1:30 p.m . Chicago time , it would remain in effect until the normal close of trading at 3:15 p.m .
With the limit in effect , members would be able to execute trades at the limit price or at higher prices , but not below it .
The exchange said it decided a new circuit breaker was needed following a review of the tumultuous trading in stocks and stock - index futures on Friday Oct. 13 , when the Dow Jones industrials plunged 190 points and stock - index futures prices skidded as well .
Late that afternoon the S&P 500 stock - index futures contract fell a total of 30 index points , hitting a Merc circuit breaker limit that remained in effect for the rest of the trading session .
The Merc said that its existing 30 - minute , 12 - point limit on S&P 500 stock - index futures trading -LRB- equal to about 100 points on the Dow Jones industrials -RRB- , which was triggered Oct. 13 , will remain in effect .
Leo Melamed , Merc executive committee chairman , said that the 12 - point limit appeared to lessen the selling panic Oct. 13 .
But when the contract reopened , the subsequent flood of sell orders that quickly knocked the contract down to the 30 - point limit indicated that the intermediate limit of 20 points was needed to help keep stock and stock - index futures prices synchronized .
Several traders maintained that the Merc 's 12 - point circuit - breaker aggravated the market slide Oct. 13 by directing additional selling pressure to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange .
All of the changes require regulatory approval , which is expected shortly .
The exchange also said that the 30 - point circuit breaker , which currently provides only a one - hour respite during market sell - offs , will become the maximum one - day limit for the S&P 500 stock - index futures contract ; the one - day limit now is 50 index points .
A final modification was made to the five - point opening limit for the contract .
The Merc said that five - point limit will remain in effect for the first 10 minutes of trading .
The limit lapses under current exchange rules if contracts trade above the limit price during the opening 10 minutes of trading .
In Washington , House aides said Mr. Phelan told congressmen that the collar , which banned program trades through the Big Board 's computer when the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved 50 points , did n't work well .
He said that firms could get around the collar by executing trades manually .
In a post-hearing news conference , Mr. Phelan , who has publicly expressed concern about market volatility , said he told the House finance and telecommunications subcommittee that he would support the program - trading halt proposal `` providing the SEC would be comfortable with the language '' in a bill .
The program - trading issue is heating up on Capitol Hill as it is on Wall Street , and several legislators want to grant the SEC the power to shut off the programs when trading becomes too volatile .
SEC Chairman Richard Breeden has said he would be willing to consider circuit breakers that have preset trigger points , but he does n't want discretionary power to stop programs .
A House aide suggested that Mr. Phelan was so `` vague and mushy '' that it was the kind of meeting where people of all viewpoints could `` come out feeling good . ''
At one point , Mr. Phelan angered the subcommittee 's chairman , Rep. Edward Markey -LRB- D. , Mass. -RRB- , by not going much beyond what already had been reported in the morning newspapers .
`` Markey said we could have done this in public '' because so little sensitive information was disclosed , the aide said .
Mr. Phelan then responded that he would have been happy just writing a report to the panel , the aide added .
At another point during the hearing , Rep. Markey asked Mr. Phelan what would be discussed at a New York exchange board meeting today .
Mr. Phelan said the Big Board is likely to study the program - trading issue .
That response annoyed Rep. Markey , House aides said , and the congressman snapped back that there had been enough studies of the issue and that it was time for action on the matter .
Fifteen of the 26 subcommittee members attended the hearing , most notably Rep. John Dingell -LRB- D. , Mich. -RRB- , the full House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman , who has been willing to let Mr. Markey carry the legislation in recent months .
Mr. Dingell expressed concern , sources said , about jurisdictional problems in regulating program trading , which uses futures to offset stock trades .
The futures industry is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , which reports to the Agriculture committees in both houses .
Boeing Co. said it is discussing plans with three of its regular Japanese suppliers to possibly help build a larger version of its popular 767 twin - jet .
The discussions are still in preliminary stages , and the specific details have n't been worked out between the Seattle aerospace company and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. , Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd .
The three Japanese companies build the body sections of the 767 , accounting for a combined 15 % of the aircraft .
Japanese press reports have speculated that the Japanese contribution could rise to between 20 % and 25 % under the new program .
If Boeing goes ahead with the larger 767 , the plane could hit the market in the mid-1990s .
Investors took advantage of Tuesday 's stock rally to book some profits yesterday , leaving stocks up fractionally .
Bond prices and the dollar both gained modestly .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished less than a point higher to close at 2645.90 in moderate trading .
But advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange were tidily ahead of declining stocks , 847 to 644 .
Long - term bond prices rose despite prospects of a huge new supply of Treasury debt this month .
Continuing demand for dollars from Japanese investors boosted the U.S. currency .
Analysts were disappointed that the enthusiasm investors showed for stocks in the wake of Georgia - Pacific 's $ 3.18 billion bid for Great Northern Nekoosa evaporated so quickly .
The industrial average jumped more than 41 points Tuesday as speculators rushed to buy shares of potential takeover targets .
But with the end of the year in sight , money managers are eager to take profits and cut their risks of losing what for many have been exceptionally good returns in
Economic news had little effect on financial markets .
As expected , a national purchasing managers ' report indicated the nation 's manufacturing sector continues to contract modestly .
The Federal Reserve 's Beige Book , a summary of economic conditions across the country , indicated that the overall economy remains in a pattern of sluggish growth .

THREE COMPUTERS THAT CHANGED the face of personal computing were launched in 1977 .
That year the Apple II , Commodore Pet and Tandy TRS - 80 came to market .
The computers were crude by today 's standards .
Apple II owners , for example , had to use their television sets as screens and stored data on audiocassettes .
But Apple II was a major advance from Apple I , which was built in a garage by Stephen Wozniak and Steven Jobs for hobbyists such as the Homebrew Computer Club .
In addition , the Apple II was an affordable $ 1,298 .
Crude as they were , these early PCs triggered explosive product development in desktop models for the home and office .
Big mainframe computers for business had been around for years .
But the new 1977 PCs -- unlike earlier built - from - kit types such as the Altair , Sol and IMSAI -- had keyboards and could store about two pages of data in their memories .
Current PCs are more than 50 times faster and have memory capacity 500 times greater than their 1977 counterparts .
There were many pioneer PC contributors .
William Gates and Paul Allen in 1975 developed an early language - housekeeper system for PCs , and Gates became an industry billionaire six years after IBM adapted one of these versions in 1981 .
Alan F. Shugart , currently chairman of Seagate Technology , led the team that developed the disk drives for PCs .
Dennis Hayes and Dale Heatherington , two Atlanta engineers , were co-developers of the internal modems that allow PCs to share data via the telephone .
IBM , the world leader in computers , did n't offer its first PC until August 1981 as many other companies entered the market .
Today , PC shipments annually total some $ 38.3 billion world - wide .
The dollar posted gains against all major currencies yesterday , buoyed by persistent Japanese demand for U.S. bond issues .
While market sentiment remains cautiously bearish on the dollar based on sluggish U.S. economic indicators , dealers note that Japanese demand has helped underpin the dollar against the yen and has kept the U.S. currency from plunging below key levels against the mark .
At the same time , dealers said the U.S. unit has been locked into a relatively narrow range in recent weeks , in part because the hefty Japanese demand for dollars has been offset by the mark 's strength , resulting in a stalemate .
Jay Goldinger , with Capital Insight Inc. , reasons that while the mark has posted significant gains against the yen as well -- the mark climbed to 77.70 yen from 77.56 yen late Tuesday in New York -- the strength of the U.S. bond market compared to its foreign counterparts has helped lure investors to dollar - denominated bonds , rather than mark bonds .
`` Dollar - yen -LCB- trade -RCB- is the driving force in the market , '' said Tom Trettien , a vice president with Banque Paribas in New York , `` but I 'm not convinced it will continue .
Who knows what will happen down the road , in three to six months , if foreign investment starts to erode ? ''
In late New York trading yesterday , the dollar was quoted at 1.8500 marks , up from 1.8415 marks late Tuesday , and at 143.80 yen , up from 142.85 yen late Tuesday .
Sterling was quoted at $ 1.5755 , down from $ 1.5805 late Tuesday .
In Tokyo Thursday , the U.S. currency opened for trading at 143.93 yen , up from Wednesday 's Tokyo close of 143.08 yen .
Douglas Madison , a corporate trader with Bank of America in Los Angeles , traced the dollar 's recent solid performance against the yen to purchases of securities by Japanese insurance companies and trust banks and the sense that another wave of investment is waiting in the wings .
He contends that the perception in Japan of a vitriolic U.S. response to Sony Corp. 's announcement of its purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. has been temporarily mollified .
He cites the recent deal between the Mitsubishi Estate Co. and the Rockefeller Group , as well as the possible white knight role of an undisclosed Japanese company in the Georgia - Pacific Corp. takeover bid for Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. as evidence .
The forthcoming maturity in November of a 10 - year Japanese government yen - denominated bond issue valued at about $ 16 billion has prompted speculation in the market that investors redeeming the bonds will diversify into dollar - denominated instruments , according to Mr. Madison .
It remains unclear whether the bond issue will be rolled over .
Meanwhile , traders in Tokyo say that the prospect of lower U.S. interest rates has spurred dollar buying by Japanese institutions .
They point out that these institutions want to lock in returns on high - yield U.S. Treasury debt and suggest demand for the U.S. unit will continue unabated until rates in the U.S. recede .
The market again showed little interest in further evidence of a slowing U.S. economy , and traders note that the market in recent weeks has taken its cues more from Wall Street than U.S. economic indicators .
Dealers said the dollar merely drifted lower following the release Wednesday of the U.S. purchasing managers ' report .
The managers ' index , which measures the health of the manufacturing sector , stood at 47.6 % in October , above September 's 46 % , and also above average forecasts for the index of 45.3 % .
Some dealers said the dollar was pressured slightly because a number of market participants had boosted their expectations in the past day and were looking for an index above 50 , which indicates an expanding manufacturing economy .
But most said the index had no more than a minimal effect on trade .
On the Commodity Exchange in New York , gold for current delivery settled at $ 374.20 an ounce , down 50 cents .
Estimated volume was a moderate 3.5 million ounces .
In early trading in Hong Kong Thursday , gold was quoted at $ 374.19 an ounce .
Your Oct. 13 page - one story on the renewed plight of Western Union says that Western Union had lost its chance to be in the telephone business by turning down Alexander Graham Bell 's offer to it of his invention , because it supposedly felt that voice communication would never replace the telegraph .
Such is hardly the case .
Bell 's father - in - law , Gardner G. Hubbard , wealthy and well - connected , obtained financing to start the American Bell Telephone Co. in Boston , which even had a subsidiary in New York called the Telephone Co. of New York .
This is where Bell 's patents went .
Western Union indeed wanted to get into the telephone business .
It acquired Thomas Edison 's microphone patent and then immediately sued the Bell Co. claiming that the microphone invented by my grandfather , Emile Berliner , which had been sold to Bell for a princely $ 50,000 , infringed upon Western Union 's Edison patent .
When Bell established that the Berliner patent caveat was registered 10 days before Edison 's application , Western Union dropped the lawsuit and agreed never to enter the telephone business -- the basis for the company 's current plight .

Signs of a slowing economy are increasing pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut short - term interest rates , but it is n't clear whether the central bank will do so .
A survey by the Fed 's 12 district banks shows economic growth has been sluggish in recent weeks , while upward pressures on prices have moderated .
`` The economy is clearly slowing , '' says Robert Black , president of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank .
`` If you look at the third quarter as posting roughly 2.5 % growth , I do see some slowing in the fourth quarter , '' agrees Kansas City Fed President Roger Guffey .
Nevertheless , both Mr. Guffey and Mr. Black say the slowdown so far is no cause for concern .
`` We 're coming closer to achieving the stated objective of slowing the economy to a point where hopefully some downward trend in prices will occur , '' said Mr. Guffey .
Bush administration officials are looking to the Fed to bring down rates , and financial markets seem to be expecting easier credit as well .
`` I think the market had been expecting the Fed to ease sooner and a little more than it has to date , '' said Robert Johnson , vice president of global markets for Bankers Trust Co .
The Fed cut the key federal funds interest rate by about 0.25 percentage point to 8.75 % after the Oct. 13 stock market plunge , but has shown no sign of movement since .
The report from the Fed found that manufacturing , in particular , has been weak in recent weeks .
The Philadelphia Fed , for instance , reported that manufacturing activity `` continues to decline '' for the fourth month in a row .
And in the Chicago district , the report said , `` a manufacturer of capital goods noted slower orders for some types , including defense equipment , petroleum equipment , food packaging machinery and material handling equipment . ''
Retail sales also were reported slow in most districts , particularly `` for discretionary , big - ticket items such as furniture , home appliances and consumer electronics . ''
And construction also was described as slow in most areas .
Despite the economic slowdown , there are few clear signs that growth is coming to a halt .
As a result , Fed officials may be divided over whether to ease credit .
Several Fed governors in Washington have been pushing for easier credit ; but many of the regional Fed presidents have been resisting such a move .
Mr. Black said he is `` pleased '' with the economy 's recent performance , and does n't see `` a lot of excesses out there that would tilt us into recession . ''
`` There is always a chance of recession , '' added Mr. Guffey , `` but if you ask me to put a percentage on it , I would think it 's well below a 50 % chance .
Since chalk first touched slate , schoolchildren have wanted to know : What 's on the test ?
These days , students can often find the answer in test - coaching workbooks and worksheets their teachers give them in the weeks prior to taking standardized achievement tests .
The mathematics section of the widely used California Achievement Test asks fifth graders : `` What is another name for the Roman numeral IX ? ''
It also asks them to add two - sevenths and three - sevenths .
Worksheets in a test - practice kit called Learning Materials , sold to schools across the country by Macmillan / McGraw - Hill School Publishing Co. , contain the same questions .
In many other instances , there is almost no difference between the real test and Learning Materials .
What 's more , the test and Learning Materials are both produced by the same company , Macmillan / McGraw - Hill , a joint venture of McGraw - Hill Inc. and Macmillan 's parent , Britain 's Maxwell Communication Corp .
Close parallels between tests and practice tests are common , some educators and researchers say .
Test - preparation booklets , software and worksheets are a booming publishing subindustry .
But some practice products are so similar to the tests themselves that critics say they represent a form of school - sponsored cheating .
`` If I took -LCB- these preparation booklets -RCB- into my classroom , I 'd have a hard time justifying to my students and parents that it was n't cheating , '' says John Kaminski , a Traverse City , Mich. , teacher who has studied test coaching .
He and other critics say such coaching aids can defeat the purpose of standardized tests , which is to gauge learning progress .
`` It 's as if France decided to give only French history questions to students in a European history class , and when everybody aces the test , they say their kids are good in European history , '' says John Cannell , an Albuquerque , N.M. , psychiatrist and founder of an educational research organization , Friends for Education , which has studied standardized testing .
Standardized achievement tests are given about 10 million times a year across the country to students generally from kindergarten through eighth grade .
The most widely used of these tests are Macmillan / McGraw 's CAT and Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills ; the Iowa Test of Basic Skills , by Houghton Mifflin Co. ; and Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. 's Metropolitan Achievement Test and Stanford Achievement Test .
Sales figures of the test - prep materials are n't known , but their reach into schools is significant .
In Arizona , California , Florida , Louisiana , Maryland , New Jersey , South Carolina and Texas , educators say they are common classroom tools .
Macmillan / McGraw says `` well over 10 million '' of its Scoring High test - preparation books have been sold since their introduction 10 years ago , with most sales in the last five years .
About 20,000 sets of Learning Materials teachers ' binders have also been sold in the past four years .
The materials in each set reach about 90 students .
Scoring High and Learning Materials are the best - selling preparation tests .
Michael Kean , director of marketing for CTB Macmillan / McGraw , the Macmillan / McGraw division that publishes Learning Materials , says it is n't aimed at improving test scores .
He also asserted that exact questions were n't replicated .
When referred to the questions that matched , he said it was coincidental .
Mr. Kaminski , the schoolteacher , and William Mehrens , a Michigan State University education professor , concluded in a study last June that CAT test versions of Scoring High and Learning Materials should n't be used in the classroom because of their similarity to the actual test .
They devised a 69 - point scale -- awarding one point for each subskill measured on the CAT test -- to rate the closeness of test preparatives to the fifth - grade CAT .
Because many of these subskills -- the symmetry of geometrical figures , metric measurement of volume , or pie and bar graphs , for example -- are only a small part of the total fifth - grade curriculum , Mr. Kaminski says , the preparation kits would n't replicate too many , if their real intent was general instruction or even general familiarization with test procedures .
But Learning Materials matched on 66.5 of 69 subskills .
Scoring High matched on 64.5 .
In CAT sections where students ' knowledge of two - letter consonant sounds is tested , the authors noted that Scoring High concentrated on the same sounds that the test does -- to the exclusion of other sounds that fifth graders should know .
Learning Materials for the fifth - grade contains at least a dozen examples of exact matches or close parallels to test items .
Rick Brownell , senior editor of Scoring High , says that Messrs. Kaminski and Mehrens are ignoring `` the need students have for becoming familiar with tests and testing format . ''
He said authors of Scoring High `` scrupulously avoid '' replicating exact questions , but he does n't deny that some items are similar .
When Scoring High first came out in 1979 , it was a publication of Random House .
McGraw - Hill was outraged .
In a 1985 advisory to educators , McGraw - Hill said Scoring High should n't be used because it represented a `` parallel form '' of the CAT and CTBS tests .
But in 1988 , McGraw - Hill purchased the Random House unit that publishes Scoring High , which later became part of Macmillan / McGraw .
Messrs. Brownell and Kean say they are unaware of any efforts by McGraw - Hill to modify or discontinue Scoring High .
When it 's time for their biannual powwow , the nation 's manufacturing titans typically jet off to the sunny confines of resort towns like Boca Raton and Hot Springs .
Not this year .
The National Association of Manufacturers settled on the Hoosier capital of Indianapolis for its fall board meeting .
And the city decided to treat its guests more like royalty or rock stars than factory owners .
The idea , of course : to prove to 125 corporate decision makers that the buckle on the Rust Belt is n't so rusty after all , that it 's a good place for a company to expand .
On the receiving end of the message were officials from giants like Du Pont and Maytag , along with lesser knowns like Trojan Steel and the Valley Queen Cheese Factory .
For starters , the executives joined Mayor William H. Hudnut III for an evening of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra and a guest pianist - comedian Victor Borge .
Champagne and dessert followed .
The next morning , with a police escort , busloads of executives and their wives raced to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway , unimpeded by traffic or red lights .
The governor could n't make it , so the lieutenant governor welcomed the special guests .
A buffet breakfast was held in the museum , where food and drinks are banned to everyday visitors .
Then , in the guests ' honor , the speedway hauled out four drivers , crews and even the official Indianapolis 500 announcer for a 10 - lap exhibition race .
After the race , Fortune 500 executives drooled like schoolboys over the cars and drivers .
No dummies , the drivers pointed out they still had space on their machines for another sponsor 's name or two .
Back downtown , the execs squeezed in a few meetings at the hotel before boarding the buses again .
This time , it was for dinner and dancing -- a block away .
Under the stars and moons of the renovated Indiana Roof ballroom , nine of the hottest chefs in town fed them Indiana duckling mousseline , lobster consomme , veal mignon and chocolate terrine with a raspberry sauce .
Knowing a tasty -- and free -- meal when they eat one , the executives gave the chefs a standing ovation .
More than a few CEOs say the red - carpet treatment tempts them to return to a heartland city for future meetings .
But for now , they 're looking forward to their winter meeting -- Boca in February .
In another reflection that the growth of the economy is leveling off , the government said that orders for manufactured goods and spending on construction failed to rise in September .
Meanwhile , the National Association of Purchasing Management said its latest survey indicated that the manufacturing economy contracted in October for the sixth consecutive month .
Its index inched up to 47.6 % in October from 46 % in September .
Any reading below 50 % suggests the manufacturing sector is generally declining .
The purchasing managers , however , also said that orders turned up in October after four months of decline .
Factories booked $ 236.74 billion in orders in September , nearly the same as the $ 236.79 billion in August , the Commerce Department said .
If not for a 59.6 % surge in orders for capital goods by defense contractors , factory orders would have fallen 2.1 % .
In a separate report , the department said construction spending ran at an annual rate of $ 415.6 billion , not significantly different from the $ 415.8 billion reported for August .
Private construction spending was down , but government building activity was up .
The figures in both reports were adjusted to remove the effects of usual seasonal patterns , but were n't adjusted for inflation .
Kenneth Mayland , economist for Society Corp. , a Cleveland bank , said demand for exports of factory goods is beginning to taper off .
At the same time , the drop in interest rates since the spring has failed to revive the residential construction industry .
`` What sector is stepping forward to pick up the slack ? '' he asked .
`` I draw a blank . ''
By most measures , the nation 's industrial sector is now growing very slowly -- if at all .
Factory payrolls fell in September .
So did the Federal Reserve Board 's industrial - production index .
Yet many economists are n't predicting that the economy is about to slip into recession .
They cite a lack of `` imbalances '' that provide early warning signals of a downturn .
Inventories are closely watched for such clues , for instance .
Economists say a buildup in inventories can provoke cutbacks in production that can lead to a recession .
But yesterday 's factory orders report had good news on that front : it said factory inventories fell 0.1 % in September , the first decline since February 1987 .
`` This conforms to the ` soft landing ' scenario , '' said Elliott Platt , an economist at Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp .
`` I do n't see any signs that inventories are excessive . ''
A soft landing is an economic slowdown that eases inflation without leading to a recession .
The department said orders for nondurable goods -- those intended to last fewer than three years -- fell 0.3 % in September to $ 109.73 billion after climbing 0.9 % the month before .
Orders for durable goods were up 0.2 % to $ 127.03 billion after rising 3.9 % the month before .
The department previously estimated that durable - goods orders fell 0.1 % in September .
Factory shipments fell 1.6 % to $ 234.4 billion after rising 5.4 % in August .
Shipments have been relatively level since January , the Commerce Department noted .
Manufacturers ' backlogs of unfilled orders rose 0.5 % in September to $ 497.34 billion , helped by strength in the defense capital goods sector .
Excluding these orders , backlogs declined 0.3 % .
In its construction spending report , the Commerce Department said residential construction , which accounts for nearly half of all construction spending , was off 0.9 % in September to an annual rate of $ 191.9 billion .
David Berson , economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association , predicted the drop in interest rates eventually will boost spending on single - family homes , but probably not until early next year .
Spending on private , nonresidential construction was off 2.6 % to an annual rate of $ 99.1 billion with no sector showing strength .
Government construction spending rose 4.3 % to $ 88 billion .
After adjusting for inflation , the Commerce Department said construction spending did n't change in September .
For the first nine months of the year , total construction spending ran about 2 % above last year 's level .
The government 's construction spending figures contrast with a report issued earlier in the week by McGraw - Hill Inc. 's F.W. Dodge Group .
Dodge reported an 8 % increase in construction contracts awarded in September .
The goverment counts money as it is spent ; Dodge counts contracts when they are awarded .
The government includes money spent on residential renovation ; Dodge does n't .
Although the purchasing managers ' index continues to indicate a slowing economy , it is n't signaling an imminent recession , said Robert Bretz , chairman of the association 's survey committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc. , Stamford , Conn .
He said the index would have to be in the low 40 % range for several months to be considered a forecast of recession .
The report offered new evidence that the nation 's export growth , though still continuing , may be slowing .
Only 19 % of the purchasing managers reported better export orders in October , down from 27 % in September .
And 8 % said export orders were down last month , compared with 6 % the month before .
The purhasing managers ' report also added evidence that inflation is under control .
For the fifth consecutive month , purchasing managers said prices for the goods they purchased fell .
The decline was even steeper than in September .
They also said that vendors were delivering goods more quickly in October than they had for each of the five previous months .
Economists consider that a sign that inflationary pressures are abating .
When demand is stronger than suppliers can handle and delivery times lengthen , prices tend to rise .
The purchasing managers ' report is based on data provided by more than 250 purchasing executives .
Each of the survey 's indicators gauges the difference between the number of purchasers reporting improvement in a particular area and the number reporting a worsening .
For the first time , the October survey polled members on imports .
It found that of the 73 % who import , 10 % said they imported more in October and 12 % said they imported less than the previous month .
While acknowledging one month 's figures do n't prove a trend , Mr. Bretz said , `` It does lead you to suspect imports are going down , or at least not increasing that much . ''
Items listed as being in short supply numbered only about a dozen , but they included one newcomer : milk and milk powder .
`` It 's an odd thing to put on the list , '' Mr. Bretz noted .
He said that for the second month in a row , food processors reported a shortage of nonfat dry milk .
They blamed increased demand for dairy products at a time of exceptionally high U.S. exports of dry milk , coupled with very low import quotas .

Furukawa Co. of Japan said it will acquire two construction machinery plants and a sales unit in France formerly belonging to Dresser Industries Inc. of the U.S. .
The company said it made the purchase in order to locally produce hydraulically operated shovels .
Last October , the company also bought a wheel - loader manufacturing plant in Heidelberg , West Germany , from Dresser .
Furukawa said the purchase of the French and German plants together will total about 40 billion yen -LRB- $ 280 million -RRB- .
Mitsui Mining & Smelting Co. posted a 62 % rise in pretax profit to 5.276 billion yen -LRB- $ 36.9 million -RRB- in its fiscal first half ended Sept. 30 compared with 3.253 billion yen a year earlier .
Net income more than tripled to 4.898 billion yen from 1.457 billion yen a year earlier .
Five things you can do for $ 15,000 or less :
1 . Buy a new Chevrolet .
2 . Take a Hawaiian vacation .
3 . Send your child to a university .
4 . Buy a diamond necklace .
5 . Make a lasting difference in the regulatory life of an American savings - and - loan association through the Foster Corporate Parents Plan .
Americans today spend $ 15,000 like pocket change -- they do n't think much about it .
But for an ailing savings - and - loan association -- teetering on insolvency -- it can lead to safety from imminent demise and to a future full of promise .
Your $ 15,000 will help keep a needy savings and loan solvent -- and out of the federal budget deficit .
As a Foster Corporate Parent , you 'll be helping a neighborhood S&L in areas crucial to its survival .
Like healthy regulatory capital .
A steady deposit base .
Performing loans .
At the same time , you 'll give your Foster Savings Institution the gift of hope and freedom from the federal regulators who want to close its doors -- for good .
As a Foster Corporate Parent , you will experience the same joy felt by Robert Bass , Lewis Ranieri , William Simon and others , who find ways to help troubled savings institutions and their employees help themselves .
That builds confidence , self sufficiency , not to mention critical regulatory net worth .
Do n't wait -- a savings institution needs your help now !
Every day you delay , a savings institution 's health -- and the federal budget deficit -- grows worse .
Think about the good you can do for just $ 15,000 a month , about the cost of a mid-size Chevrolet or two semesters at a state university .
Then send your support to a savings institution that has taken a bad rap in the press and on its bottom line .
Every $ 15,000 you send will go a long way to boost sagging net worth and employee morale -- and keep your Foster Savings Institution off the federal budget deficit !

LTV Corp. said a federal bankruptcy court judge agreed to extend until March 8 , 1990 , the period in which the steel , aerospace and energy products company has the exclusive right to file a reorganization plan .
The company is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code , giving it court protection from creditors ' lawsuits while it attempts to work out a plan to pay its debts .

The Transportation Department , responding to pressure from safety advocates , took further steps to impose on light trucks and vans the safety requirements used for automobiles .
The department proposed requiring stronger roofs for light trucks and minivans , beginning with 1992 models .
It also issued a final rule requiring auto makers to equip light trucks and minivans with lap - shoulder belts for rear seats beginning in the 1992 model year .
Such belts already are required for the vehicles ' front seats .
`` Today 's action , '' Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said , `` represents another milestone in the ongoing program to promote vehicle occupant safety in light trucks and minivans through its extension of passenger car standards . ''
In September , the department had said it will require trucks and minivans to be equipped with the same front - seat headrests that have long been required on passenger cars .
The Big Three auto makers said the rule changes were n't surprising because Bush administration officials have long said they planned to impose car safety standards on light trucks and vans .
Safety advocates , including some members of Congress , have been urging the department for years to extend car - safety requirements to light trucks and vans , which now account for almost one - third of all vehicle sales in the U.S. .
They say that many vehicles classed as commercial light trucks actually carry more people than cargo and therefore should have the same safety features as cars .
They did n't have much luck during the Reagan administration .
`` But now , there seems to be a fairly systematic effort to address the problem , '' said Chuck Hurley , vice president of communications for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety .
`` We 're in a very different regulatory environment . ''
Sen. John Danforth -LRB- R. , Mo . -RRB- praised the department 's actions , noting that rollover crashes account for almost half of all light - truck deaths .
`` We could prevent many of these fatalities with minimum roof - crush standards , '' he said .
Sen. Danforth and others also want the department to require additional safety equipment in light trucks and minivans , including air bags or automatic seat belts in front seats and improved side - crash protection .
The department 's roof - crush proposal would apply to vehicles weighing 10,000 pounds or less .
The roofs would be required to withstand a force of 1.5 times the unloaded weight of the vehicle .
During the test , the roof could n't be depressed more than five inches .
In Detroit , a Chrysler Corp. official said the company currently has no rear - seat lap and shoulder belts in its light trucks , but plans to begin phasing them in by the end of the 1990 model year .
He said Chrysler fully expects to have them installed across its light - truck line by the Sept. 1 , 1991 , deadline .
Chrysler said its trucks and vans already meet the roof - crush resistance standard for cars .
John Leinonen , executive engineer of Ford Motor Co. 's auto - safety office , said Ford trucks have met car standards for roof - crush resistance since 1982 .
Ford began installing the rear - seat belts in trucks with its F - series Crew Cab pickups in the 1989 model year .
The new Explorer sport - utility vehicle , set for introduction next spring , will also have the rear - seat belts .
Mr. Leinonen said he expects Ford to meet the deadline easily .
The Treasury said it plans to sell $ 30 billion in notes and bonds next week , but said the auctions will be postponed unless Congress acts quickly to lift the federal debt ceiling .
Michael Basham , deputy assistant secretary for federal finance , said the Treasury may wait until late Monday or even early Tuesday to announce whether the autions are to be rescheduled .
Unless it can raise money in financial markets , Mr. Basham said , the federal government wo n't have the cash to pay off $ 13.8 billion in Treasury bills that mature on Thursday .
Without congressional action , the Treasury ca n't sell any new securities -- even savings bonds .
But despite partisan bickering over the debt ceiling , which has become entangled in the fight over cutting capital - gains taxes , Congress is almost certain to act in time to avoid default .
`` Each day that Congress fails to act ... will cause additional disruption in our borrowing schedule , possibly resulting in higher interest costs to the taxpayer , '' Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said in a speech prepared for delivery last night to a group of bankers .
`` To avoid these costs , and a possible default , immediate action is imperative . ''
The securities to be sold next week will raise about $ 10 billion in cash and redeem $ 20 billion in maturing notes .
The new securities , part of the federal government 's regular quarterly refunding , will consist of :
-- $ 10 billion of three - year notes , to be auctioned Tuesday and to mature Nov. 15 , 1992 .
-- $ 10 billion of 10 - year notes , to be auctioned Wednesday and to mature Nov. 15 , 1999 .
-- $ 10 billion of 30 - year bonds , to be auctioned Thursday and to mature Aug. 15 , 2019 .
The Treasury also said it plans to sell $ 10 billion in 36 - day cash management bills on Thursday .
They will mature Dec. 21 .
None of the securities will be eligible for when - issued trading until Congress approves an increase in the debt ceiling , clearing the way for a formal offering , Mr. Basham said .
The Treasury said it needs to raise $ 47.5 billion in the current quarter in order to end December with a $ 20 billion cash balance .
Auctions held in October and those scheduled for next week will raise a total of $ 25.6 billion .
The remaining $ 21.9 billion could be raised through the sale of short - term Treasury bills , two - year notes in November and five - year notes in early December , the Treasury said .
In the first three months of 1990 , the Treasury estimates that it will have to raise between $ 45 billion and $ 50 billion , assuming that it decides to aim for a $ 10 billion cash balance at the end of March .
A seat on the Chicago Board of Trade was sold for $ 350,000 , down $ 16,000 from the previous sale last Friday .
Seats currently are quoted at $ 331,000 , bid , and $ 350,000 , asked .
The record price for a full membership on the exchange is $ 550,000 , set Aug. 31 , 1987 .
Texas Instruments Japan Ltd. , a unit of Texas Instruments Inc. , said it opened a plant in South Korea to manufacture control devices .
The new plant , located in Chinchon about 60 miles from Seoul , will help meet increasing and diversifying demand for control products in South Korea , the company said .
The plant will produce control devices used in motor vehicles and household appliances .
The U.S. , claiming some success in its trade diplomacy , removed South Korea , Taiwan and Saudi Arabia from a list of countries it is closely watching for allegedly failing to honor U.S. patents , copyrights and other intellectual - property rights .
However , five other countries -- China , Thailand , India , Brazil and Mexico -- will remain on that so - called priority watch list as a result of an interim review , U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills announced .
Under the new U.S. trade law , those countries could face accelerated unfair - trade investigations and stiff trade sanctions if they do n't improve their protection of intellectual property by next spring .
Mrs. Hills said many of the 25 countries that she placed under varying degrees of scrutiny have made `` genuine progress '' on this touchy issue .
She said there is `` growing realization '' around the world that denial of intellectual - property rights harms all trading nations , and particularly the `` creativity and inventiveness of an -LCB- offending -RCB- country 's own citizens . ''
U.S. trade negotiators argue that countries with inadequate protections for intellectual - property rights could be hurting themselves by discouraging their own scientists and authors and by deterring U.S. high - technology firms from investing or marketing their best products there .
Mrs. Hills lauded South Korea for creating an intellectual - property task force and special enforcement teams of police officers and prosecutors trained to pursue movie and book pirates .
Seoul also has instituted effective search - and - seizure procedures to aid these teams , she said .
Taiwan has improved its standing with the U.S. by initialing a bilateral copyright agreement , amending its trademark law and introducing legislation to protect foreign movie producers from unauthorized showings of their films .
That measure could compel Taipei 's growing number of small video - viewing parlors to pay movie producers for showing their films .
Saudi Arabia , for its part , has vowed to enact a copyright law compatible with international standards and to apply the law to computer software as well as to literary works , Mrs. Hills said .
These three countries are n't completely off the hook , though .
They will remain on a lower - priority list that includes 17 other countries .
Those countries -- including Japan , Italy , Canada , Greece and Spain -- are still of some concern to the U.S. but are deemed to pose less - serious problems for American patent and copyright owners than those on the `` priority '' list .
Gary Hoffman , a Washington lawyer specializing in intellectual - property cases , said the threat of U.S. retaliation , combined with a growing recognition that protecting intellectual property is in a country 's own interest , prompted the improvements made by South Korea , Taiwan and Saudi Arabia .
`` What this tells us is that U.S. trade law is working , '' he said .
He said Mexico could be one of the next countries to be removed from the priority list because of its efforts to craft a new patent law .
Mrs. Hills said that the U.S. is still concerned about `` disturbing developments in Turkey and continuing slow progress in Malaysia . ''
She did n't elaborate , although earlier U.S. trade reports have complained of videocassette piracy in Malaysia and disregard for U.S. pharmaceutical patents in Turkey .
The 1988 trade act requires Mrs. Hills to issue another review of the performance of these countries by April 30 .
So far , Mrs. Hills has n't deemed any cases bad enough to merit an accelerated investigation under the so - called special 301 provision of the act .

Without admitting or denying wrongdoing , they consented to findings that they failed to return funds owed to customers in connection with a limited - partnership offering .
Reached at his office , Mr. McFall , currently chairman , said , `` An implication that we failed to return investor funds is inappropriate and inaccurate . ''

The Department of Health and Human Services plans to extend its moratorium on federal funding of research involving fetal - tissue transplants .
Medical researchers believe the transplantation of small amounts of fetal tissue into humans could help treat juvenile diabetes and such degenerative diseases as Alzheimer 's , Parkinson 's and Huntington 's .
But anti-abortionists oppose such research because they worry that the development of therapies using fetal - tissue transplants could lead to an increase in abortions .
James Mason , assistant secretary for health , said the ban on federal funding of fetal - tissue transplant research `` should be continued indefinitely . ''
He said the ban wo n't stop privately funded tissue - transplant research or federally funded fetal - tissue research that does n't involve transplants .
Department officials say that HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan will support Dr. Mason 's ruling , which will be issued soon in the form of a letter to the acting director of the National Institutes of Health .
Both Dr. Mason and Dr. Sullivan oppose federal funding for abortion , as does President Bush , except in cases where a woman 's life is threatened .
The controversy began in 1987 when the National Institutes of Health , aware of the policy implications of its research , asked for an HHS review of its plan to implant fetal tissue into the brain of a patient suffering from Parkinson 's disease .
The department placed a moratorium on the research , pending a review of scientific , legal and ethical issues .
A majority of an NIH - appointed panel recommended late last year that the research continue under carefully controlled conditions , but the issue became embroiled in politics as anti-abortion groups continued to oppose federal funding .
The dispute has hampered the administration 's efforts to recruit prominent doctors to fill prestigious posts at the helm of the NIH and the Centers for Disease Control .
Several candidates have withdrawn their names from consideration after administration officials asked them for their views on abortion and fetal - tissue transplants .
Antonio Novello , whom Mr. Bush nominated to serve as surgeon general , reportedly has assured the administration that she opposes abortion .
Dr. Novello is deputy director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development .
Some researchers have charged that the administration is imposing new ideological tests for top scientific posts .
Earlier this week , Dr. Sullivan tried to defuse these charges by stressing that candidates to head the NIH and the CDC will be judged by `` standards of scientific and administrative excellence , '' not politics .
But the administration 's handling of the fetal - tissue transplant issue disturbs many scientists .
`` When scientific progress moves into uncharted ground , there has to be a role for society to make judgments about its applications , '' says Myron Genel , associate dean of the Yale Medical School .
`` The disturbing thing about this abortion issue is that the debate has become polarized , so that no mechanism exists '' for finding a middle ground .
Yale is one of the few medical institutions conducting privately funded research on fetal - tissue transplants .
But Dr. Genel warns that Dr. Mason 's ruling may discourage private funding .
`` The unavailability of federal funds , and the climate in which the decision was made , certainly do n't provide any incentive for one of the more visible foundations to provide support , '' he said .
Despite the flap over transplants , federal funding of research involving fetal tissues will continue on a number of fronts .
`` Such research may ultimately result in the ability to regenerate damaged tissues or to turn off genes that cause cancer '' or to regulate genes that cause Down 's syndrome , the leading cause of mental retardation , according to an NIH summary .
The NIH currently spends about $ 8 million annually on fetal - tissue research out of a total research budget of $ 8 billion .
Rally 's Inc. said it has redeemed its rights outstanding issued Monday in its shareholder rights plan .
The company said holders of stock of record Nov. 10 will receive 1/10th of one cent a share as the redemption payment .
The fast - food company said its decision was based upon discussions with a shareholder group , Giant Group Ltd. , `` in an effort to resolve certain disputes with the company . ''
Giant Group is led by three Rally 's directors , Burt Sugarman , James M. Trotter III and William E. Trotter II , who last month indicated they hold a 42.5 % stake in Rally 's and plan to seek a majority of seats on Rally 's nine - member board .
R.P. Scherer Corp. said it completed the $ 10.2 million sale of its Southern Optical subsidiary to a group led by the unit 's president , Thomas R. Sloan , and other managers .
Following the acquisition of R.P. Scherer by a buy - out group led by Shearson Lehman Hutton earlier this year , the maker of gelatin capsules decided to divest itself of certain of its non-encapsulating businesses .
The sale of Southern Optical is a part of the program .
Newsweek , trying to keep pace with rival Time magazine , announced new advertising rates for 1990 and said it will introduce a new incentive plan for advertisers .
The new ad plan from Newsweek , a unit of the Washington Post Co. , is the second incentive plan the magazine has offered advertisers in three years .
Plans that give advertisers discounts for maintaining or increasing ad spending have become permanent fixtures at the news weeklies and underscore the fierce competition between Newsweek , Time Warner Inc. 's Time magazine , and Mortimer B. Zuckerman 's U.S. News & World Report .
Alan Spoon , recently named Newsweek president , said Newsweek 's ad rates would increase 5 % in January .
A full , four - color page in Newsweek will cost $ 100,980 .
In mid-October , Time magazine lowered its guaranteed circulation rate base for 1990 while not increasing ad page rates ; with a lower circulation base , Time 's ad rate will be effectively 7.5 % higher per subscriber ; a full page in Time costs about $ 120,000 .
U.S. News has yet to announce its 1990 ad rates .
Newsweek said it will introduce the Circulation Credit Plan , which awards space credits to advertisers on `` renewal advertising . ''
The magazine will reward with `` page bonuses '' advertisers who in 1990 meet or exceed their 1989 spending , as long as they spent $ 325,000 in 1989 and $ 340,000 in 1990 .
Mr. Spoon said the plan is not an attempt to shore up a decline in ad pages in the first nine months of 1989 ; Newsweek 's ad pages totaled 1,620 , a drop of 3.2 % from last year , according to Publishers Information Bureau .
`` What matters is what advertisers are paying per page , and in that department we are doing fine this fall , '' said Mr. Spoon .
Both Newsweek and U.S. News have been gaining circulation in recent years without heavy use of electronic giveaways to subscribers , such as telephones or watches .
However , none of the big three weeklies recorded circulation gains recently .
According to Audit Bureau of Circulations , Time , the largest newsweekly , had average circulation of 4,393,237 , a decrease of 7.3 % .
Newsweek 's circulation for the first six months of 1989 was 3,288,453 , flat from the same period last year .
U.S. News ' circulation in the same time was 2,303,328 , down 2.6 % .
As an actor , Charles Lane is n't the inheritor of Charlie Chaplin 's spirit .
Steve Martin has already laid his claim to that .
But it is Mr. Lane , as movie director , producer and writer , who has been obsessed with refitting Chaplin 's Little Tramp in a contemporary way .
In 1976 , as a film student at the Purchase campus of the State University of New York , Mr. Lane shot `` A Place in Time , '' a 36 - minute black - and - white film about a sketch artist , a man of the streets .
Now , 13 years later , Mr. Lane has revived his Artist in a full - length movie called `` Sidewalk Stories , '' a poignant piece of work about a modern - day tramp .
Of course , if the film contained dialogue , Mr. Lane 's Artist would be called a homeless person .
So would the Little Tramp , for that matter .
I say `` contained dialogue '' because `` Sidewalk Stories '' is n't really silent at all .
Composer Marc Marder , a college friend of Mr. Lane 's who earns his living playing the double bass in classical music ensembles , has prepared an exciting , eclectic score that tells you what the characters are thinking and feeling far more precisely than intertitles , or even words , would .
Much of Mr. Lane 's film takes a highly romanticized view of life on the streets -LRB- though probably no more romanticized than Mr. Chaplin 's notion of the Tramp as the good - hearted free spirit -RRB- .
Filmed in lovely black and white by Bill Dill , the New York streets of `` Sidewalk Stories '' seem benign .
On Wall Street men and women walk with great purpose , noticing one another only when they jostle for cabs .
The Artist hangs out in Greenwich Village , on a strip of Sixth Avenue populated by jugglers , magicians and other good - natured hustlers .
-LRB- This clearly is not real life : no crack dealers , no dead - eyed men selling four - year - old copies of Cosmopolitan , no one curled up in a cardboard box . -RRB-
The Artist has his routine .
He spends his days sketching passers - by , or trying to .
At night he returns to the condemned building he calls home .
His life , including his skirmishes with a competing sketch artist , seems carefree .
He is his own man .
Then , just as the Tramp is given a blind girl to cure in `` City Lights , '' the Artist is put in charge of returning a two - year - old waif -LRB- Nicole Alysia -RRB- , whose father has been murdered by thugs , to her mother .
This cute child turns out to be a blessing and a curse .
She gives the Artist a sense of purpose , but also alerts him to the serious inadequacy of his vagrant life .
The beds at the Bowery Mission seem far drearier when he has to tuck a little girl into one of them at night .
To further load the stakes , Mr. Lane dreamed up a highly improbable romance for the Artist , with a young woman who owns her own children 's shop and who lives in an expensive high - rise apartment building .
This story line might resonate more strongly if Mr. Lane had as strong a presence in front of the camera as he does behind it .
Mr. Lane 's final purpose is n't to glamorize the Artist 's vagabond existence .
He has a point he wants to make , and he makes it , with a great deal of force .
The movie ends with sound , the sound of street people talking , and there is n't anything whimsical or enviable in those rough , beaten voices .
The French film maker Claude Chabrol has managed another kind of weird achievement with his `` Story of Women . ''
He has made a harsh , brilliant picture -- one that 's captivating -- about a character who , viewed from the most sympathetic angle , would seem disagreeable .
Yet this woman , Marie - Louise Giraud , carries historical significance , both as one of the last women to be executed in France and as a symbol of the Vichy government 's hypocrisy .
While Vichy collaborated with the Germans during World War II in the deaths of thousands of Resistance fighters and Jews , its officials needed a diversionary symbolic traitor .
Marie - Louise , a small - time abortionist , was their woman .
She became an abortionist accidentally , and continued because it enabled her to buy jam , cocoa and other war - rationed goodies .
She was untrained and , in one botched job killed a client .
Her remorse was shallow and brief .
Although she was kind and playful to her children , she was dreadful to her war - damaged husband ; she openly brought her lover into their home .
As presented by Mr. Chabrol , and played with thin - lipped intensity by Isabelle Huppert , Marie - Louise -LRB- called Marie Latour in the film -RRB- was not a nice person .
But she did n't deserve to have her head chopped off .
There is very little to recommend `` Old Gringo , '' a confused rendering of the Carlos Fuentes novel of the Mexican Revolution .
Most of the picture is taken up with endless scenes of many people either fighting or eating and drinking to celebrate victory .
I mention the picture only because many bad movies have a bright spot , and this one has Gregory Peck , in a marvelously loose and energetic portrayal of an old man who wants to die the way he wants to die .
Video Tip : Before seeing `` Sidewalk Stories , '' take a look at `` City Lights , '' Chaplin 's Tramp at his finest .
It was Richard Nixon 's first visit to China in 1972 that set in motion the historic rapprochement between Beijing and Washington .
But the former U.S. president 's sixth visit to China , during which he spoke at length with Chinese leaders , was nowhere near as successful at easing strains that have recently afflicted the Sino - U.S. relationship .
Mr. Nixon , the most prominent American to come to China since Beijing 's bloody suppression of pro-democracy demonstrators in June , harped on international outrage over the massacre .
The Chinese , in turn , took aim at American `` interference '' in China 's domestic affairs .
One official newspaper , Legal Daily , even directly criticized Mr. Nixon , who is normally referred to here as an `` old friend . ''
The paper accused him of being a leading proponent of `` peaceful evolution , '' a catch phrase to describe what China believes is the policy of Western countries to seduce socialist nations into the capitalist sphere .
The tension was evident on Wednesday evening during Mr. Nixon 's final banquet toast , normally an opportunity for reciting platitudes about eternal friendship .
Instead , Mr. Nixon reminded his host , Chinese President Yang Shangkun , that Americans have n't forgiven China 's leaders for the military assault of June 3 - 4 that killed hundreds , and perhaps thousands , of demonstrators .
`` Many in the United States , including many friends of China , believe the crackdown was excessive and unjustified , '' Mr. Nixon told Mr. Yang , who was directly involved in ordering the attack .
`` The events of April through June damaged the respect and confidence which most Americans previously had for the leaders of China . ''
The Chinese responded in an equally undiplomatic fashion .
In talks with Mr. Nixon , Chinese leaders expressed no regret for the killings , and even suggested that the U.S. was prominently involved in the demonstrations this spring .
In a meeting Tuesday , supreme leader , Deng Xiaoping , told Mr. Nixon , `` Frankly speaking , the U.S. was involved too deeply in the turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion which occurred in Beijing not long ago .
China was the real victim and it is unjust to reprove China for it . ''
Despite the harsh exchanges , the U.S. and China still seem to be looking for a way to mend relations , which have deteriorated into what Mr. Nixon referred to as `` the greatest crisis in Chinese - American relations '' since his initial visit to China 17 years ago .
In his return toast to Mr. Nixon , Mr. Yang said the relationship had reached a `` stalemate . ''
Relations between China and the U.S. have been tense since June 7 , when Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi and his wife , Li Shuxian , took refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing .
Shortly afterwards , Mr. Bush imposed a series of anti-China sanctions , including suspension of most high - level talks , which could be codified in U.S. congressional legislation in the coming weeks .
Mr. Nixon is traveling in China as a private citizen , but he has made clear that he is an unofficial envoy for the Bush administration .
Mr. Nixon met Mr. Bush and his national security adviser , Brent Scowcroft , before coming to China on Saturday .
And he plans to brief the president at the end of the week , U.S. sources said .
Mr. Nixon was to leave China today .
According to an American member of the Nixon party , the former president raised a number of controversial issues in his 20 hours of talks with top - level Chinese officials .
These included China 's economic policies , human rights and the question of Mr. Fang .
Mr. Nixon also proposed that China restore its participation in the Fulbright Program , a U.S. government - funded academic exchange .
China pulled out of the program in July .
In his talks , the former president urged China 's leaders to acknowledge that their nation is part of the world community and welcome the infusion of outside contacts and ideas .
`` Ideas are going over borders , and there 's no SDI ideological weapon that can shoot them down , '' he told a group of Americans at the U.S. Embassy on Wednesday .
There are no signs , however , of China 's yielding on key issues .
But in one minor matter , Mr. Nixon appears to have gained a concession .
In a meeting with Premier Li Peng on Monday , Mr. Nixon said that he hoped he would n't encounter guards with machine guns during his visit to the U.S. Embassy .
Sure enough , when he arrived at the embassy two days later , the machine - gun - toting guards were gone -- for the first time in five months .
A few blocks away , at the U.S. ambassador 's residence , the guards encircling the compound also had discarded their Uzi - model arms for the first time since early June .
But the guards there retained their pistols , and a large contingent of plainclothes police remained nearby in unmarked cars .
Moreover , police and soldiers continue to harass Americans , who have filed several protests with the Foreign Ministry in the past week .
Several times , Chinese guards have pointed their automatic rifles at young children of U.S. diplomats and clicked the trigger .
The rifles were n't loaded .
Criticism in the U.S. over recent Japanese acquisitions is looming ever larger in the two countries ' relations .
Officials from both nations say the U.S. public 's skittishness about Japanese investment could color a second round of bilateral economic talks scheduled for next week in Washington .
Not that Washington and Tokyo disagree on the Japanese acquisitions ; indeed , each has come out in favor of unfettered investment in the U.S. .
Where they disagree is on the subject of U.S. direct investment in Japan .
The U.S. wants the removal of what it perceives as barriers to investment ; Japan denies there are real barriers .
The heated talk stirred up by recent Japanese investments in the U.S. is focusing attention on the differences in investment climate , even though it 's only one of many subjects to be covered in the bilateral talks , known as the Structural Impediments Initiative .
The Japanese `` should see this rhetoric as a signal of the need for a change in their own economy , '' says Charles Dallara , U.S. assistant Treasury secretary , who has been in Tokyo this week informally discussing the impending negotiations with government and business leaders .
`` We have a long history of maintaining an open direct - investment policy , '' Mr. Dallara says .
`` U.S. investors should have a greater opportunity at direct investment '' in Japan .
The Japanese fret openly about the U.S. public 's rancor .
One clear sign of Japan 's nervousness came this week , when a spokesman for Japan 's Foreign Ministry devoted nearly all of a regular , half - hour briefing for foreign journalists to the subject of recent Japanese investments in the U.S. .
`` We believe that it is vitally important for those Japanese business interests -LCB- in the U.S. . -RCB- to be more aware of the emotions and concerns of the American people , '' said the spokesman , Taizo Watanabe .
At the same time , though , he chastised the media for paying such close attention to Japanese investment when other foreign countries , notably Britain , are acquiring more American assets .
Fears that Japanese investors are buying up America have escalated sharply in the past several weeks , with Sony Corp. 's purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. from Coca - Cola Co. and Mitsubishi Estate Co. 's acquisition of a 51 % holding in Rockefeller Group , the owner of some of midtown Manhattan 's most exclusive real estate .
Even before those moves added fuel , the fires of discontent had been well stoked by the highly publicized experience in Japan of one U.S. investor , T. Boone Pickens Jr .
The Texas oilman has acquired a 26.2 % stake valued at more than $ 1.2 billion in an automotive - lighting company , Koito Manufacturing Co .
But he has failed to gain any influence at the company .
Koito has refused to grant Mr. Pickens seats on its board , asserting he is a greenmailer trying to pressure Koito 's other shareholders into buying him out at a profit .
Mr. Pickens made considerable political hay with his troubles in Japan .
The Senate Finance Committee , chaired by a fellow Texan , Democratic Sen. Lloyd Bentsen , last month urged U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills to use Mr. Pickens 's experience in talks with Tokyo `` to highlight this problem facing Americans who seek access to the Japanese capital markets . ''
While Mr. Dallara and Japanese officials say the question of investors ' access to the U.S. and Japanese markets may get a disproportionate share of the public 's attention , a number of other important economic issues will be on the table at next week 's talks .
Among them are differences in savings and investment rates , corporate structures and management , and government spending .
Each side has a litany of recommendations for the other .
The U.S. says it is anxious for results .
`` We feel very strongly that we really need action across the full range of issues we 've identified , and we need it by next spring , '' Mr. Dallara says .
Both sides have agreed that the talks will be most successful if negotiators start by focusing on the areas that can be most easily changed .
But they have n't clarified what those might be .
After the first set of meetings two months ago , some U.S. officials complained that Japan had n't come up with specific changes it was prepared to make .
The Japanese retort that the first round was too early to make concessions .
`` Just to say the distribution system is wrong does n't mean anything , '' says a Ministry of International Trade and Industry official .
`` We need to clarify what exactly is wrong with it . ''
That process of sorting out specifics is likely to take time , the Japanese say , no matter how badly the U.S. wants quick results .
For instance , at the first meeting the two sides could n't even agree on basic data used in price discussions .
Since then , a team of about 15 MITI and U.S. Commerce Department officials have crossed the globe gauging consumer prices .
By Monday , they hope to have a sheaf of documents both sides can trust .
`` Little by little , there is progress , '' says the MITI official .
`` Both sides are taking action . ''

A form of asbestos once used to make Kent cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed to it more than 30 years ago , researchers reported .
The asbestos fiber , crocidolite , is unusually resilient once it enters the lungs , with even brief exposures to it causing symptoms that show up decades later , researchers said .
Lorillard Inc. , the unit of New York - based Loews Corp. that makes Kent cigarettes , stopped using crocidolite in its Micronite cigarette filters in 1956 .
Although preliminary findings were reported more than a year ago , the latest results appear in today 's New England Journal of Medicine , a forum likely to bring new attention to the problem .
A Lorillard spokewoman said , `` This is an old story .
We 're talking about years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties .
There is no asbestos in our products now . ''
Neither Lorillard nor the researchers who studied the workers were aware of any research on smokers of the Kent cigarettes .
`` We have no useful information on whether users are at risk , '' said James A. Talcott of Boston 's Dana - Farber Cancer Institute .
Dr. Talcott led a team of researchers from the National Cancer Institute and the medical schools of Harvard University and Boston University .
The Lorillard spokeswoman said asbestos was used in `` very modest amounts '' in making paper for the filters in the early 1950s and replaced with a different type of filter in 1956 .
From 1953 to 1955 , 9.8 billion Kent cigarettes with the filters were sold , the company said .
Among 33 men who worked closely with the substance , 28 have died -- more than three times the expected number .
Four of the five surviving workers have asbestos - related diseases , including three with recently diagnosed cancer .
The total of 18 deaths from malignant mesothelioma , lung cancer and asbestosis was far higher than expected , the researchers said .
`` The morbidity rate is a striking finding among those of us who study asbestos - related diseases , '' said Dr. Talcott .
The percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the West Groton , Mass. , paper factory appears to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied in Western industrialized countries , he said .
The plant , which is owned by Hollingsworth & Vose Co. , was under contract with Lorillard to make the cigarette filters .
The finding probably will support those who argue that the U.S. should regulate the class of asbestos including crocidolite more stringently than the common kind of asbestos , chrysotile , found in most schools and other buildings , Dr. Talcott said .
The U.S. is one of the few industrialized nations that does n't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth , needle - like fibers such as crocidolite that are classified as amphobiles , according to Brooke T. Mossman , a professor of pathlogy at the University of Vermont College of Medicine .
More common chrysotile fibers are curly and are more easily rejected by the body , Dr. Mossman explained .
In July , the Environmental Protection Agency imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos .
By 1997 , almost all remaining uses of cancer - causing asbestos will be outlawed .
About 160 workers at a factory that made paper for the Kent filters were exposed to asbestos in the 1950s .
Areas of the factory were particularly dusty where the crocidolite was used .
Workers dumped large burlap sacks of the imported material into a huge bin , poured in cotton and acetate fibers and mechanically mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters .
Workers described `` clouds of blue dust '' that hung over parts of the factory , even though exhaust fans ventilated the area .
`` There 's no question that some of those workers and managers contracted asbestos - related diseases , '' said Darrell Phillips , vice president of human resources for Hollingsworth & Vose .
`` But you have to recognize that these events took place 35 years ago .
It has no bearing on our work force today .
Pick a country , any country .
It 's the latest investment craze sweeping Wall Street : a rash of new closed - end country funds , those publicly traded portfolios that invest in stocks of a single foreign country .
No fewer than 24 country funds have been launched or registered with regulators this year , triple the level of all of 1988 , according to Charles E. Simon & Co. , a Washington - based research firm .
The turf recently has ranged from Chile to Austria to Portugal .
Next week , the Philippine Fund 's launch will be capped by a visit by Philippine President Corazon Aquino -- the first time a head of state has kicked off an issue at the Big Board here .
The next province ?
`` Anything 's possible -- how about the New Guinea Fund ? '' quips George Foot , a managing partner at Newgate Management Associates of Northampton , Mass .
The recent explosion of country funds mirrors the `` closed - end fund mania '' of the 1920s , Mr. Foot says , when narrowly focused funds grew wildly popular .
They fell into oblivion after the 1929 crash .
Unlike traditional open - end mutual funds , most of these one - country portfolios are the `` closed - end '' type , issuing a fixed number of shares that trade publicly .
The surge brings to nearly 50 the number of country funds that are or soon will be listed in New York or London .
These funds now account for several billions of dollars in assets .
`` People are looking to stake their claims '' now before the number of available nations runs out , says Michael Porter , an analyst at Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co. , New York .
Behind all the hoopla is some heavy - duty competition .
As individual investors have turned away from the stock market over the years , securities firms have scrambled to find new products that brokers find easy to sell .
And the firms are stretching their nets far and wide to do it .
Financial planners often urge investors to diversify and to hold a smattering of international securities .
And many emerging markets have outpaced more mature markets , such as the U.S. and Japan .
Country funds offer an easy way to get a taste of foreign stocks without the hard research of seeking out individual companies .
But it does n't take much to get burned .
Political and currency gyrations can whipsaw the funds .
Another concern : The funds ' share prices tend to swing more than the broader market .
When the stock market dropped nearly 7 % Oct. 13 , for instance , the Mexico Fund plunged about 18 % and the Spain Fund fell 16 % .
And most country funds were clobbered more than most stocks after the 1987 crash .
What 's so wild about the funds ' frenzy right now is that many are trading at historically fat premiums to the value of their underlying portfolios .
After trading at an average discount of more than 20 % in late 1987 and part of last year , country funds currently trade at an average premium of 6 % .
The reason : Share prices of many of these funds this year have climbed much more sharply than the foreign stocks they hold .
It 's probably worth paying a premium for funds that invest in markets that are partially closed to foreign investors , such as South Korea , some specialists say .
But some European funds recently have skyrocketed ; Spain Fund has surged to a startling 120 % premium .
It has been targeted by Japanese investors as a good long - term play tied to 1992 's European economic integration .
And several new funds that are n't even fully invested yet have jumped to trade at big premiums .
`` I 'm very alarmed to see these rich valuations , '' says Smith Barney 's Mr. Porter .
The newly fattened premiums reflect the increasingly global marketing of some country funds , Mr. Porter suggests .
Unlike many U.S. investors , those in Asia or Europe seeking foreign - stock exposure may be less resistant to paying higher prices for country funds .
`` There may be an international viewpoint cast on the funds listed here , '' Mr. Porter says .
Nonetheless , plenty of U.S. analysts and money managers are aghast at the lofty trading levels of some country funds .
They argue that U.S. investors often can buy American depositary receipts on the big stocks in many funds ; these so - called ADRs represent shares of foreign companies traded in the U.S. .
That way investors can essentially buy the funds without paying the premium .
For people who insist on jumping in now to buy the funds , Newgate 's Mr. Foot says : `` The only advice I have for these folks is that those who come to the party late had better be ready to leave quickly .

Some Democrats in Congress are warning that a complicated new funding device for the two federal antitrust agencies could result in further cutbacks in a regulatory area already reduced sharply in recent years .
The funding mechanism , which has received congressional approval and is expected to be signed by President Bush , would affect the antitrust operations of the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission .
As a part of overall efforts to reduce spending , Congress cut by $ 30 million the Bush administration 's request for antitrust enforcement for fiscal 1990 , which began Oct. 1 .
To offset the reduction , Congress approved a $ 20,000 fee that investors and companies will have to pay each time they make required filings to antitrust regulators about mergers , acquisitions and certain other transactions .
Some Democrats , led by Rep. Jack Brooks -LRB- D. , Texas -RRB- , unsuccessfully opposed the measure because they fear that the fees may not fully make up for the budget cuts .
But Justice Department and FTC officials said they expect the filing fees to make up for the budget reductions and possibly exceed them .
`` It could operate to augment our budget , '' James Rill , the Justice Department 's antitrust chief , said in an interview .
Under measures approved by both houses of Congress , the administration 's request for $ 47 million for the Antitrust Division would be cut $ 15 million .
The FTC budget request of $ 70 million , about $ 34 million of which would go for antitrust enforcement , would also be cut by $ 15 million .
The administration had requested roughly the same amount for antitrust enforcement for fiscal 1990 as was appropriated in fiscal 1989 .
The offsetting fees would apply to filings made under the Hart - Scott - Rodino Act .
Under that law , parties proposing mergers or acquisitions valued at $ 15 million or more must notify FTC and Justice Department antitrust regulators before completing the transactions .
Currently , the government charges nothing for such filings .
Proponents of the funding arrangement predict that , based on recent filing levels of more than 2,000 a year , the fees will yield at least $ 40 million this fiscal year , or $ 10 million more than the budget cuts .
`` When you do that , there is not a cut , but there is in fact a program increase of $ 5 million '' each for the FTC and the Justice Department , Rep. Neal Smith -LRB- D. , Iowa -RRB- said during House debate .
But Rep. Don Edwards -LRB- D. , Calif . -RRB- responded that a recession could stifle merger activity , reducing the amount of fees collected .
The antitrust staffs of both the FTC and Justice Department were cut more than 40 % in the Reagan administration , and enforcement of major merger cases fell off drastically during that period .
`` Today is not the time to signal that Congress in any way sanctions the dismal state into which antitrust enforcement has fallen , '' Mr. Edwards argued .
Any money in excess of $ 40 million collected from the fees in fiscal 1990 would go to the Treasury at large .
Corporate lawyers said the new fees would n't inhibit many mergers or other transactions .
Though some lawyers reported that prospective acquirers were scrambling to make filings before the fees take effect , government officials said they had n't noticed any surge in filings .
Two leading constitutional - law experts said President Bush does n't have the legal authority to exercise a line - item veto .
Professors Philip Kurland of the University of Chicago and Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School said any effort by President Bush to claim authority for a line - item veto would contradict the text of the Constitution and the intent of its authors , as well as the views of previous presidents .
A line - item veto is a procedure that would allow a president to veto part of a big congressional spending bill without having to scuttle the entire measure .
Mr. Bush has said he would like to be able to use this procedure .
A White House spokesman said last week that the president is considering declaring that the Constitution implicitly gives him the authority for a line - item veto to provoke a test case .
But the two legal experts , responding to an inquiry by Sen. Edward Kennedy -LRB- D. , Mass. -RRB- , wrote in a joint letter that the president `` lacks the constitutional authority to exercise a line - item veto . ''
The two professors represent different ends of the political spectrum -- Mr. Kurland is a conservative and Mr. Tribe is a liberal .
The two professors said the Constitution authorizes the president to veto entire bills , not partial measures .
Moreover , they said the first appropriations bill passed 200 years ago covered many different items , and there was no discussion of a line - item veto .
They also said that more than a dozen presidents have called for line - item veto authority since the Civil War , and `` all have shared the view that such lawmaking power is beyond the reach '' of the president .
Sen. Kennedy said in a separate statement that he supports legislation to give the president line - item veto power , but that it would be a `` reckless course of action '' for President Bush to claim the authority without congressional approval .
Your Oct. 6 editorial `` The Ill Homeless '' referred to research by us and six of our colleagues that was reported in the Sept. 8 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association .
Your comments implied we had discovered that the `` principal cause '' of homelessness is to be found in the large numbers of mentally ill and substance - abusing people in the homeless population .
We have made no such statement .
It is clear that most mentally ill people and most alcoholics do not become homeless .
The `` causes '' of homelessness are poorly understood and complex in any individual case .
In quoting from our research you emphasized the high prevalance of mental illness and alcoholism .
You did not note that the homeless people we examined had a multitude of physical disorders in addition to their psychiatric problems and substance abuse .
They suffered from malnutrition , chest diseases , cardiovascular disorders , skin problems , infectious diseases and the aftereffects of assaults and rape .
Homeless people not only lack safety , privacy and shelter , they also lack the elementary necessities of nutrition , cleanliness and basic health care .
In a recent report , the Institute of Medicine pointed out that certain health problems may predispose a person to homelessness , others may be a consequence of it , and a third category is composed of disorders whose treatment is difficult or impossible if a person lacks adequate shelter .
The interactions between health and homelessness are complex , defying sweeping generalizations as to `` cause '' or `` effect . ''
If we look to the future , preventing homelessness is an important objective .
This will require us to develop a much more sophisticated understanding of the dynamics of homelessness than we currently possess , an understanding that can be developed only through careful study and research .

A study by Tulane Prof. James Wright says homelessness is due to a complex array of problems , with the common thread of poverty .
The study shows that nearly 40 % of the homeless population is made up of women and children and that only 25 % of the homeless exhibits some combination of drug , alcohol and mental problems .
According to Dr. Wright , homelessness is `` simultaneously a housing problem , an employment problem , a demographic problem , a problem of social disaffiliation , a mental health problem , a family violence problem , a problem created by the cutbacks in social welfare spending , a problem resulting from the decay of the traditional nuclear family , and a problem intimately connected to the recent increase in the number of persons living below the poverty level . ''

To quote the highly regarded director of a privately funded drop - in center for the homeless in New York : `` If you 're homeless , you do n't sleep for fear of being robbed or murdered .
After your first three weeks of sleep deprivation , you 're scarcely in touch with reality any more ; without psychiatric treatment , you may well be unable to fend for yourself ever again . ''
Some of the homeless , obviously , had pre-existing mental illness or addiction .
But many others have fallen through cracks in the economy into the grim , brutal world of our city streets .
Once there , what ways of escape are open to them other than drink , drugs or insanity ?
Maxwell R.D. Vos Brooklyn , N.Y .
You dismiss as `` sentimental '' the view that the reduction of federal housing - assistance programs by 77 % might have played a significant role in the increased number of men and women sleeping on our city streets during the Reagan - Bush years .
There is no sign that you bothered to consider the inverse of your logic : namely , that mental illness and substance abuse might be to some degree consequences rather than causes of homelessness .
Your research stopped when a convenient assertion could be made .
Robert S. Jenkins Cambridge , Mass .
Of the approximately 200 sponsors of the recent march in Washington for the homeless , you chose to cite such groups as the National Association of Home Builders and the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen , insinuating that the march got its major support from self - serving groups that `` know a good thing when they see it , '' and that the crusade was based on greed or the profit motive .
But is n't the desire for profit the driving force behind those who subscribe to , and advertise in , your paper ?
Why did n't you mention the YMCA or the YWCA or Catholic Charities USA or a hundred other nonprofit organizations that participated in the march ?
As for the findings on the 203 Baltimore homeless who underwent psychiatric examinations , I suggest you conduct your own survey .
Choose 203 business executives , including , perhaps , someone from your own staff , and put them out on the streets , to be deprived for one month of their homes , families and income .
I would predict that within a short time most of them would find Thunderbird a satisfactory substitute for Chivas Regal and that their `` normal '' phobias , anxieties , depressions and substance abuse would increase dramatically .

Researchers at American Telephone & Telegraph Co. 's Bell Laboratories reported they raised the electrical current - carrying capacity of new superconductor crystals by a factor of 100 , moving the materials closer to commercial use .
The scientists said they created small changes in the crystal - lattice structures of the superconductors to raise the amount of current that single crystals could carry to 600,000 amps per square centimeter in a moderately strong magnetic field .
The scientists said they made the advance with yttrium - containing superconductors cooled to liquid - nitrogen temperature , or minus 321 degrees Fahrenheit .
Their report appears in today 's issue of the journal Nature .
The finding marks a significant step in research on `` bulk '' superconductors , which are aimed at use in wires for motors , magnets , generators and other applications .
Scientists had obtained even higher current - carrying capacity in thin films of the new superconductors , but have had problems increasing the amount of current that bulk crystals could carry .
Superconductors conduct electricity without resistance when cooled .
A family of ceramic superconductors discovered during the past three years promise new technologies such as cheaper electrical generation -- but only if their current - carrying capacity can be raised .
The AT&T advance shows how one aspect of the current - carrying problem can be overcome .
But `` it wo n't lead to imminent use '' of new superconductors , cautioned Robert B. van Dover , one of the AT&T researchers .
He added that the current - carrying capacity of multi-crystal samples of superconductors remains too low for most practical uses because of so - called weak links between crystals .
Such multi-crystal materials will probably be needed for commercial applications .
Mr. van Dover said the AT&T team created the desired crystal changes by bombarding superconductor samples with neutrons , a process that creates some radioactivity in the samples and may not be feasible for large - scale commercial use .
Still , scientists breathed a collective sigh of relief about the finding , because it demonstrates how to overcome the `` flux pinning '' problem that earlier this year was widely publicized as undercutting new superconductors ' potential .
The problem involves the motion of small magnetic fields within superconductor crystals , limiting their current - carrying capacity .
Mr. van Dover said the crystal changes his team introduced apparently pins the magnetic fields in place , preventing them from lowering current - carrying capacity .
Mr. van Dover added that researchers are trying to determine precisely what crystal changes solved the problem .
Determining that may enable them to develop better ways to introduce the needed crystal - lattice patterns .
The AT&T team also is trying to combine their latest superconductor process with `` melt - textured growth , '' a process discovered earlier at Bell Laboratories .
The combined processes may significantly raise the current - carrying capacity of multi-crystal samples .
After years of struggling , the Los Angeles Herald Examiner will publish its last edition today , shut down by its parent , Hearst Corp. , following unsuccessful efforts to sell the venerable newspaper .
The demise of the 238,000 - circulation Herald , once the nation 's largest afternoon newspaper with circulation exceeding 700,000 , turns the country 's second - largest city into a one - newspaper town , at least in some senses .
The Los Angeles Times , with a circulation of more than 1.1 million , dominates the region .
But it faces stiff competition in Orange County from the Orange County Register , which sells more than 300,000 copies a day , and in the San Fernando Valley from the Los Angeles Daily News , which sells more than 170,000 .
Nearby cities such as Pasadena and Long Beach also have large dailies .
In July , closely held Hearst , based in New York , put the paper on the block .
Speculation had it that the company was asking $ 100 million for an operation said to be losing about $ 20 million a year , but others said Hearst might have virtually given the paper away .
An attempted buy - out led by John J. McCabe , chief operating officer , never materialized , and a stream of what one staff member dismissed as `` tire - kickers and lookee - loos '' had filed through since .
The prospective buyers included investor Marvin Davis and the Toronto Sun .
The death of the Herald , a newsstand paper in a freeway town , was perhaps inevitable .
Los Angeles is a sprawling , balkanized newspaper market , and advertisers seemed to feel they could buy space in the mammoth Times , then target a particular area with one of the regional dailies .
The Herald was left in limbo .
Further , the Herald seemed torn editorially between keeping its old - time Hearst readership -- blue - collar and sports - oriented -- and trying to provide a sprightly , upscale alternative to the sometimes staid Times .
Hearst had flirted with a conversion to tabloid format for years but never executed the plan .
The Herald joins the Baltimore News - American , which folded , and the Boston Herald - American , which was sold , as cornerstones of the old Hearst newspaper empire abandoned by the company in the 1980s .
Many felt Hearst kept the paper alive as long as it did , if marginally , because of its place in family history .
Its fanciful offices were designed by architect Julia Morgan , who built the Hearst castle at San Simeon .
William Randolph Hearst had kept an apartment in the Spanish Renaissance - style building .
Analysts said the Herald 's demise does n't necessarily represent the overall condition of the newspaper industry .
`` The Herald was a survivor from a bygone age , '' said J. Kendrick Noble , a media analyst with PaineWebber Inc .
`` Actually , the long deterioration in daily newspapers shows signs of coming to an end , and the industry looks pretty healthy . ''
Founded as the Examiner in 1903 by Mr. Hearst , the Herald was crippled by a bitter , decade - long strike that began in 1967 and cut circulation in half .
Financially , it never recovered ; editorially , it had its moments .
In 1979 , Hearst hired editor James Bellows , who brightened the editorial product considerably .
He and his successor , Mary Anne Dolan , restored respect for the editorial product , and though in recent years the paper had been limping along on limited resources , its accomplishments were notable .
For example , the Herald consistently beat its much - larger rival on disclosures about Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley 's financial dealings .
The Herald 's sports coverage and arts criticism were also highly regarded .
Robert J. Danzig , vice president and general manager of Hearst Newspapers , stood up in the paper 's newsroom yesterday and announced that no buyers had stepped forward and that the paper would fold , putting more than 730 full - time employees out of work .
Hearst said it would provide employees with a placement service and pay them for 60 days .
Some long - tenured employees will receive additional benefits , the company said .
Hours after the announcement , representatives of the Orange County Register were in a bar across the street recruiting .
The reaction in the newsroom was emotional .
`` I 've never seen so many people crying in one place at one time , '' said Bill Johnson , an assistant city editor .
`` So Long , L.A. '' was chosen as the paper 's final headline .
`` I 'm doing the main story , and I 'm already two beers drunk , '' said reporter Andy Furillo , whom the Times hired away several years ago but who returned to the Herald out of preference .
His wife also works for the paper , as did his father .
Outside , a young pressman filling a news box with an extra edition headlined `` Herald Examiner Closes '' refused to take a reader 's quarter .
`` Forget it , '' he said as he handed her a paper .
`` It does n't make any difference now .
Consumer confidence stayed strong in October , despite the unsettling gyrations of the stock market .
`` The sharp stock market decline in late October appears to have had little or no effect on consumers , '' said Fabian Linden , executive director of the Conference Board 's consumer research center .
`` Survey returns received after the drop in the Dow Jones average were about the same as the views expressed prior to that event . ''
The nonprofit , industry - supported group said its Consumer Confidence Index was 116.4 in October , barely changed from a revised 116.3 in September .
The index was 116.9 in October 1988 and in the past year has ranged from a low of 112.9 to a high of 120.7 .
It uses a base of 100 in 1985 .
In October , more people said that present business conditions were `` good '' than in September .
An equal number in each month said that employment conditions were good .
And 19.6 % of consumers contacted believed business conditions will improve in the coming six months , compared with 18.3 % in September .
Also , more people said conditions will worsen in the period .
-LRB- Fewer said conditions wo n't change . -RRB-
In October 1988 , 21.1 % said business conditions would improve .
In October 1989 , 16.9 % said more jobs will be created in the coming six months , compared with 17.4 % in September and 18.6 % in October 1988 .
Only 26.8 % in October , compared with 28.5 % in September and 26.8 % in October 1988 , said income would increase .
`` The sustained level of confidence can be attributed to the continued favorable circumstances which affect the consumer 's day - to - day economic life , '' said Mr. Linden .
`` Unemployment continues at a relatively low level , providing a sense of job security , and a low inflation rate has kept the purchasing power of the weekly paycheck reasonably strong . ''
The consumer confidence survey , covering 5,000 U.S. households , is conducted in the first two weeks of each month for the Conference Board by National Family Opinion Inc. , a Toledo , Ohio , market researcher .
Buying plans were mixed in October , with fewer households indicating plans to buy cars and more saying they will buy homes and appliances in the coming six months .
In October , 6.7 % of respondents said they will buy a car , easing from September when 8.1 % anticipated a purchase .
In October 1988 , 7.3 % said they would buy a car .
Home purchase plans increased to 3.3 % from 3.1 % in the two recent months .
In October 1988 , 3.7 % said they would buy a house .
In 1989 , home purchase plans have ranged monthly from 2.9 % to 3.7 % of respondents .
In October , 30.6 % said they will buy appliances in the coming six months , compared with 27.4 % in September and 26.5 % in October 1988 .
Follow - up report :
You now may drop by the Voice of America offices in Washington and read the text of what the Voice is broadcasting to those 130 million people around the world who tune in to it each week .
You can even take notes -- extensive notes , for the Voice folks wo n't look over your shoulder -- about what you read .
You can do all this even if you 're not a reporter or a researcher or a scholar or a member of Congress .
And my newspaper can print the text of those broadcasts .
Until the other day , you as an ordinary citizen of this democracy had no right to see what your government was telling your cousins around the world .
That was the law .
And I apparently had no right to print hither what the Voice was booming to yon .
It was censorship .
It was outrageous .
And it was stupid .
The theory was that the Voice is a propaganda agency and this government should n't propagandize its own people .
That sounds neat , but this government -- any government -- propagandizes its own people every day .
Government press releases , speeches , briefings , tours of military facilities , publications are all propaganda of sorts .
Propaganda is just information to support a viewpoint , and the beauty of a democracy is that it enables you to hear or read every viewpoint and then make up your own mind on an issue .
The restrictions on viewing and dissemination of Voice material were especially absurd : An agency in the information business was not being allowed to inform .
In June 1988 , I wrote in this space about this issue .
Assuming it was n't one of those columns that you clipped and put on the refrigerator door , I 'll review the facts .
The Voice of America is a government agency that broadcasts news and views -- some might say propaganda -- in 43 languages to 130 million listeners around the world .
It does a first - rate job .
Its budget $ 184 million -- is paid for by you .
But a 1948 law barred the `` dissemination '' of that material in the U.S. .
The law let scholars , reporters and researchers read texts of VOA material , only at VOA headquarters in Washington , but it barred them from copying texts .
And , of course , there 's that word `` dissemination . ''
How 's that again ?
`` You may come by the agency to read but not copy either manually or by photocopying , '' a Voice official explained when I asked .
What if I tune in my short - wave radio , transcribe an editorial or program , and print it in my newspaper ?
`` Nor are you free to reprint such material , '' I was advised .
That sounded a lot like censorship , so after years of letters and conversations that went nowhere , I sued .
A couple of weeks ago , I lost the case in federal district court in Des Moines .
At least , that 's the way it was reported .
And , indeed , the lawsuit was dismissed .
But I -- I like to think of it in terms of we , all of us -- won the point .
For a funny thing happened on the way to the ruling : The United States Information Agency , which runs the Voice , changed its position on three key points .
-- The USIA said that , on reflection , of course I could print anything I could get my hands on .
The word dissemination , it decided , referred only to itself .
`` The USIA officially and publicly declared the absolute right of everyone except the USIA to disseminate agency program materials in the United States , '' my lawyer , the scholarly Mark McCormick of Des Moines , said in a memo pointing out the facts and trying to make me feel good after the press reported that I had lost .
The court noted the new USIA position but , just in case , officially found `` that Congress did not intend to preclude plaintiffs from disseminating USIA information domestically . ''
-- The USIA said that , on reflection , anyone could view the VOA materials , not just the reporters , scholars , researchers and congressmen who are mentioned in the statute .
`` The USIA publicly and officially stated in the litigation that all persons are allowed access to the materials , notwithstanding the statutory designations , because the USIA has determined that it will not check the credentials of any person appearing and requesting to see the materials , '' Mr. McCormick noted .
-- And the USIA said that all of us could take extensive notes .
`` The agency publicly and officially declared in the lawsuit that persons who examine the materials may make notes and , while the agency position is that persons may not take verbatim notes , no one will check to determine what notes a person has taken , '' Mr. McCormick reported .
I had sought , in my suit , the right to print Voice material , which had been denied me , and I had sought a right to receive the information , arguing in effect that a right to print government information is n't very helpful if I have no right to get the information .
But the court disagreed .
`` The First Amendment proscribes the government from passing laws abridging the right to free speech , '' Judge Donald O'Brien ruled .
`` The First Amendment does not prescribe a duty upon the government to assure easy access to information for members of the press . ''
So now the situation is this :
You have a right to read Voice of America scripts if you do n't mind traveling to Washington every week or so and visiting the Voice office during business hours .
I have a right to print those scripts if I go there and laboriously -- but no longer surreptitiously -- copy them out in long hand .
But neither of us can copy the material on a Xerox machine or have it sent to us .
In an era when every government agency has a public - relations machine that sends you stuff whether you want it or not , this does seem odd .
Indeed , Judge O'Brien ruled that `` it would be easy to conclude that the USIA 's position is ` inappropriate or even stupid , ' '' but it 's the law .
So the next step , I suspect , is to try to get the law changed .
We -LRB- I assume you 're in this with me at this point -RRB- need to get three words -- `` for examination only '' -- eliminated from the law .
Section 501 of the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 says Voice material shall be available to certain of us -LRB- but now , thanks to the USIA 's new position , all of us -RRB- `` for examination only . ''
If those words were n't there , the nice people at the Voice would be able to send you the information or , at the very least , let you photocopy it .
This is not a trivial issue .
`` You have ... raised important questions which ought to be answered : What does USIA say about America abroad ; how do we say it ; and how can American taxpayers get the answers to these questions ? '' a man wrote me a couple of years ago .
The man was Charles Z. Wick .
At the time , he was director of the
He had no answers then .
Now there are some .
This democracy is suddenly a little more democratic .
I feel pretty good about it .
Mr. Gartner is editor and co-owner of the Daily Tribune in Ames , Iowa , and president of NBC News in New York .
John F. Barrett , 40 , formerly executive vice president and chief financial officer , was named president and chief operating officer , posts which had been vacant .
Robert L. Bernstein , chairman and president of Random House Inc. , announced his resignation from the publishing house he has run for 23 years .
A successor was n't named , which fueled speculation that Mr. Bernstein may have clashed with S.I. Newhouse Jr. , whose family company , Advance Publications Inc. , owns Random House .
Abrupt departures are n't unheard of within the Newhouse empire .
In an interview , Mr. Bernstein said his departure `` evolved out of discussions with Si Newhouse and that 's the decision I reached . ''
He declined to elaborate , other than to say , `` It just seemed the right thing to do at this minute .
Sometimes you just go with your gut . ''
Mr. Bernstein said he will stay until Dec. 31 and work with his successor , who is to be named soon .
Mr. Newhouse , meanwhile , insisted that he is n't unhappy with Mr. Bernstein or the performance of Random House , the largest trade publishing house in the U.S. .
The company said the publisher 's annual sales volume increased to $ 800 million from $ 40 million during Mr. Bernstein 's tenure .
`` Bob has handled the extraordinary growth of the company quite brilliantly , '' said Mr. Newhouse .
`` The company is doing well , it 's stable , it 's got good people .
Bob has an agenda and this seemed like the natural time . ''
Publishing officials believe that while Random House has enjoyed spectacular growth and has smoothly integrated many acquisitions in recent years , some of the bigger ones have n't been absorbed so easily .
Crown Publishing Group , acquired last year , is said to be turning in disappointing results .
As a private company , Random House does n't report its earnings .
Mr. Bernstein , who succeeded Bennett Cerf , has been only the second president of Random House since it was founded in 1925 .
Speculation on his successor centers on a number of division heads at the house .
Possible candidates include Susan Petersen , president of Ballantine / Del Rey / Fawcett , Random House 's huge and successful paperback division .
Some say Anthony Cheetham , head of a recently acquired British company , Century Hutchinson , could be chosen .
There is also speculation that Mr. Newhouse could bring in a powerhouse businessman or another Newhouse family member to run the business side , in combination with a publishing executive like Robert Gottlieb , who left Random House 's Alfred A. Knopf to run the New Yorker , also owned by the Newhouse family .
Not included on the most - likely - successor list are Joni Evans , recruited two years ago to be publisher of adult trade books for Random House , and Sonny Mehta , president of the prestigious Alfred A. Knopf unit .
When Ms. Evans took her job , several important divisions that had reported to her predecessor were n't included partly because she did n't wish to be a full - time administrator .
Mr. Mehta is widely viewed as a brilliant editor but a less - than - brilliant administrator and his own departure was rumored recently .
Mr. Bernstein , a tall , energetic man who is widely respected as a publishing executive , has spent much of his time in recent years on human rights issues .
Although his team lost the World Series , San Francisco Giants owner Bob Lurie hopes to have a new home for them .
He is an avid fan of a proposition on next week 's ballot to help build a replacement for Candlestick Park .
Small wonder , since he 's asking San Francisco taxpayers to sink up to $ 100 million into the new stadium .
As San Francisco digs out from The Pretty Big One , opponents say the last thing the city can afford is an expensive new stadium .
A stadium craze is sweeping the country .
It 's fueled by the increasing profitability of major - league teams .
Something like one - third of the nation 's 60 largest cities are thinking about new stadiums , ranging from Cleveland to San Antonio and St. Petersburg .
Most boosters claim the new sports complexes will be moneymakers for their city .
Pepperdine University economist Dean Baim scoffs at that .
He has looked at 14 baseball and football stadiums and found that only one -- private Dodger Stadium -- brought more money into a city than it took out .
Stadiums tend to redistribute existing wealth within a community , not create more of it .
Voters generally agree when they are given a chance to decide if they want to sink their own tax dollars into a new mega-stadium .
San Francisco voters rejected a new ballpark two years ago .
Last month , Phoenix voters turned thumbs down on a $ 100 million stadium bond and tax proposition .
Its backers fielded every important interest on their team -- a popular mayor , the Chamber of Commerce , the major media -- and spent $ 100,000 on promotion .
But voters decided that if the stadium was such a good idea someone would build it himself , and rejected it 59 % to 41 % .
In San Francisco , its backers concede the ballpark is at best running even in the polls .
George Christopher , the former San Francisco mayor who built Candlestick Park for the Giants in the 1960s , wo n't endorse the new ballpark .
He says he had Candlestick built because the Giants claimed they needed 10,000 parking spaces .
Since the new park will have only 1,500 spaces , Mr. Christopher thinks backers are playing some fiscal `` games '' of their own with the voters .
Stadium boosters claim that without public money they would never be built .
Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie disagrees , and he can prove it .
Several years ago he gave up trying to persuade Miami to improve its city - owned Orange Bowl , and instead built his own $ 100 million coliseum with private funds .
He did n't see why the taxpayers should help build something he would then use to turn a healthy profit .
`` This stadium shows that anything government can do , we can do better , '' Mr. Robbie says .
But to Moon Landrieu , the former New Orleans mayor who helped build that city 's cavernous , money - losing Superdome , questions of who benefits or the bottom line are of little relevance .
`` The Superdome is an exercise in optimism , a statement of faith , '' he has said .
`` It is the very building of it that is important , not how much of it is used or its economics . ''
An Egyptian Pharaoh could n't have justified his pyramids any better .
But civilization has moved forward since then .
Today taxpayers get to vote , most of the time , on whether they want to finance the building schemes of our modern political pharaohs , or let private money erect these playgrounds for public passions .
Companies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts ' estimates .
The companies are followed by at least three analysts , and had a minimum five - cent change in actual earnings per share .
Estimated and actual results involving losses are omitted .
The percent difference compares actual profit with the 30 - day estimate where at least three analysts have issues forecasts in the past 30 days .
Otherwise , actual profit is compared with the 300 - day estimate .
The Bush administration 's nomination of Clarence Thomas to a seat on the federal appeals court here received a blow this week when the American Bar Association gave Mr. Thomas only a `` qualified '' rating , rather than `` well qualified . ''
People familiar with the Senate Judiciary Committee , which will vote on the nomination , said some liberal members of the panel are likely to question the ABA rating in hearings on the matter .
Mr. Thomas , currently chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , would add another conservative voice to the closely divided court .
Groups have accused him of advocating policies that narrowed rights of older workers and of ignoring discrimination by large companies .
Fourteen members of the House with jurisdiction over the EEOC have said they oppose Mr. Thomas 's nomination because of `` serious questions about his judgment -LCB- and -RCB- respect for the law . ''
A senior Justice Department official , however , said the administration is n't worried about the ABA rating .
`` We 're pleased the ABA rated him qualified , '' David Runkel , the department 's chief spokesman , said in an interview .
The ABA gives a `` qualified '' rating to nominees it believes would perform `` satisfactorily '' on the bench .
In contrast , the lawyers ' association gives a `` well qualified '' rating to those `` regarded as one of the best available for the vacancy .
World sugar futures prices soared on rumors that Brazil , a major grower and exporter , might not ship sugar this crop year and next .
Prices also were boosted by another rumor that Mexico , usually a large producer and exporter , might have to buy a large quantity of sugar .
Although traders rushed to buy futures contracts , many remained skeptical about the Brazilian development , which could n't be confirmed , analysts said .
The March and May contracts rose to fresh life - of - contract highs of 14.54 cents and 14.28 cents at their best levels of the day .
The March delivery , which has no limits , settled at 14.53 cents , up 0.56 cent a pound .
The May contract , which also is without restraints , ended with a gain of 0.54 cent to 14.26 cents .
The July delivery rose its daily permissible limit of 0.50 cent a pound to 14.00 cents , while other contract months showed near - limit advances .
According to reports carried by various news services , the Brazilian government told its sugar producers that they wo n't be allowed to export sugar during the current 1989 - 90 season , which began May 1 , and the 1990 - 91 season so that it can be used to produce alcohol for automobile fuel .
One analyst , Arthur Stevenson , of Prudential - Bache Securities , New York , estimated that 65 % or more of Brazil 's newly made automobiles run on alcohol and ca n't use gasoline .
`` This is a demand that must be met , regardless of the price of oil , '' said Mr. Stevenson .
Brazil is the third - largest producer and the fifth - largest exporter of sugar in the world .
A shift to producing more alcohol and less sugar had been expected , but the latest news , if true , indicates a more drastic shift than had been anticipated .
During the current crop year , Brazil was expected to produce 6.9 million tons of sugar , a drop from 8.1 million tons in 1988 - 89 .
Its 1989 - 90 exports were expected to total 645,000 tons in contrast to shipments of 1.5 million tons in
`` It is these 645,000 tons that are in question for this crop year , '' explained Judith Ganes , analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton , New York .
`` Producers were granted the right earlier this year to ship sugar and the export licenses were expected to have begun to be issued '' yesterday .
As a result , Ms. Ganes said , it is believed that little or no sugar from the 1989 - 90 crop has been shipped yet , even though the crop year is six months old .
More than a half of all sugar produced in Brazil goes for alcohol production , according to Ms. Ganes .
Also , there has been a switch in the past decade to planting of orange trees in areas that were previously used for cane , and this change is being felt now , she said .
Most important , Ms. Ganes noted , `` Brazilian officials said that no decision has as yet been made on the suspension of exports . ''
Thomas Oxnard , sugar analyst for PaineWebber in Hackensack , N.J. , said : `` I am highly skeptical that Brazil will curtail sugar exports , particularly with the price of sugar at over 14 cents a pound . ''
Above all , Mr. Oxnard noted , the situation is extremely confused .
`` Professional sugar people here who have strong contacts with the Brazilian sugar industry have been unable to confirm the reports or get enough information to clarify the situation , '' he said .
`` It 's the type of nervous atmosphere in which a report can be put out , such as the one saying exports will be suspended , and no one can confirm it . ''
Mr. Oxnard observed that the situation in Brazil is also very complicated .
On the one hand , Brazil started an ethanol program about 15 years ago to fuel a huge portion of its national fleet of cars and is now committed to this program .
`` It has to weigh , on the other hand , the relatively high price of sugar it can earn on the export market in making decisions as to whether to produce sugar or alcohol , '' Mr. Oxnard said .
Mexico , which is normally a sugar exporter , has had production problems in the past two years , analysts said .
Last year , it had to buy sugar on the world market to meet export commitments , they noted .
This year it is expected to be a net importer and is said to be seeking to buy about 200,000 tons of sugar to meet internal needs , analysts said .
In other commodity markets yesterday :
ENERGY :
Petroleum futures were generally higher with heating oil leading the way .
On the New York Mercantile Exchange , heating oil for December delivery increased 1.25 cents to settle at 60.36 cents a gallon .
Gasoline futures were mixed to unchanged .
But the strength in heating oil helped push up crude oil .
West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery rose 13 cents a barrel to settle at $ 20.07 .
The firmness in heating oil was attributed to colder weather in parts of the U.S. and to the latest weekly report by the American Petroleum Institute , which showed a decline in inventories of the fuel .
GRAINS AND SOYBEANS :
Prices closed mostly higher in relatively light trading as farmers continued to withhold their crops from the marketplace in the hope of higher prices to come .
Trading was muted in part because of the observance of All Saints ' Day across much of Europe .
Continued export demand also supported prices .
As an indicator of the tight grain supply situation in the U.S. , market analysts said that late Tuesday the Chinese government , which often buys U.S. grains in quantity , turned instead to Britain to buy 500,000 metric tons of wheat .
Traders said prices also were supported by widespread rumors that the Soviet Union is on the verge of receiving most favored nation status from the U.S. .
That designation would , among other things , provide more generous credit terms under which the Soviets could purchase grain .
The Soviets are widely believed to need additional supplies , despite running up record one - month purchases of 310 million bushels of corn in October .
COPPER :
Futures prices rose , extending Tuesday 's gains .
The December contract advanced 2.50 cents a pound to $ 1.1650 .
Buying for the most part carried over from the previous session , and traders apparently ignored reports that a Chilean mine strike may have ended almost before it began , an analyst said .
According to news service reports , most workers at the Disputado mines owned by Exxon Corp. agreed to a new two - year wage contract that includes a 5 % increase and other benefits .
However , some workers have n't yet accepted the new contract and are continuing negotiations , the analyst said .
Separately , Reuter reported that the Papua - New Guinea government urged its Parliament to extend a state of emergency in copper - rich Bougainville Island for two months .
The Bougainville copper mine has been inoperative since May 15 because of attacks by native landowners who want Bougainville to secede from Papua - New Guinea .
For six years , T. Marshall Hahn Jr. has made corporate acquisitions in the George Bush mode : kind and gentle .
The question now : Can he act more like hard - charging Teddy Roosevelt ?
Mr. Hahn , the 62 - year - old chairman and chief executive officer of Georgia - Pacific Corp. is leading the forest - product concern 's unsolicited $ 3.19 billion bid for Great Northern Nekoosa Corp .
Nekoosa has given the offer a public cold shoulder , a reaction Mr. Hahn has n't faced in his 18 earlier acquisitions , all of which were negotiated behind the scenes .
So far , Mr. Hahn is trying to entice Nekoosa into negotiating a friendly surrender while talking tough .
`` We are prepared to pursue aggressively completion of this transaction , '' he says .
But a takeover battle opens up the possibility of a bidding war , with all that implies .
If a competitor enters the game , for example , Mr. Hahn could face the dilemma of paying a premium for Nekoosa or seeing the company fall into the arms of a rival .
Given that choice , associates of Mr. Hahn and industry observers say the former university president -- who has developed a reputation for not overpaying for anything -- would fold .
`` There 's a price above which I 'm positive Marshall has the courage not to pay , '' says A.D. Correll , Georgia - Pacific 's executive vice president for pulp and paper .
Says long - time associate Jerry Griffin , vice president , corporate development , at WTD Industries Inc. : `` He is n't of the old school of winning at any cost . ''
He also is a consensus manager , insiders say .
The decision to make the bid for Nekoosa , for example , was made only after all six members of Georgia - Pacific 's management committee signed onto the deal -- even though Mr. Hahn knew he wanted to go after the company early on , says Mr. Correll .
Associates say Mr. Hahn picked up that careful approach to management as president of Virginia Polytechnic Institute .
Assuming that post at the age of 35 , he managed by consensus , as is the rule in universities , says Warren H. Strother , a university official who is researching a book on Mr. Hahn .
But he also showed a willingness to take a strong stand .
In 1970 , Mr. Hahn called in state police to arrest student protesters who were occupying a university building .
That impressed Robert B. Pamplin , Georgia - Pacific 's chief executive at the time , whom Mr. Hahn had met while fundraising for the institute .
In 1975 , Mr. Pamplin enticed Mr. Hahn into joining the company as executive vice president in charge of chemicals ; the move befuddled many in Georgia - Pacific who did n't believe a university administrator could make the transition to the corporate world .
But Mr. Hahn rose swiftly through the ranks , demonstrating a raw intelligence that he says he knew he possessed early on .
The son of a physicist , Mr. Hahn skipped first grade because his reading ability was so far above his classmates .
Moving rapidly through school , he graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Kentucky at age 18 , after spending only 2 1/2 years in college .
He earned his doctorate in nuclear physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
Mr. Hahn agrees that he has a `` retentive '' memory , but friends say that 's an understatement .
They call it `` photographic '' .
Mr. Hahn also has engineered a surprising turnaround of Georgia - Pacific .
Taking over as chief executive officer in 1983 , he inherited a company that was mired in debt and hurt by a recession - inspired slide in its building - products business .
Mr. Hahn began selling non-core businesses , such as oil and gas and chemicals .
He even sold one unit that made vinyl checkbook covers .
At the same time , he began building up the pulp and paper segment of the company while refocusing building products on home repair and remodeling , rather than materials for new - home construction .
The idea was to buffet building products from cycles in new - home construction .
The formula has paid off , so far .
Georgia - Pacific 's sales climbed to $ 9.5 billion last year , compared with $ 6 billion in 1983 , when Mr. Hahn took the reins .
Profit from continuing operations has soared to $ 467 million from $ 75 million .
Mr. Hahn attributes the gains to the philosophy of concentrating on what a company knows best .
`` The record of companies that have diversified is n't all that impressive , '' he says .
Nekoosa would n't be a diversification .
It would be a good match , Mr. Hahn and many analysts say , of two healthy companies with high - quality assets and strong cash flows .
The resulting company would be the largest forest - products concern in the world with combined sales of more than $ 13 billion .
But can Mr. Hahn carry it off ?
In this instance , industry observers say , he is entering uncharted waters .
Says Kathryn McAuley , an analyst at First Manhattan Co. : `` This is the greatest acquisition challenge he has faced .
The limits to legal absurdity stretched another notch this week when the Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal from a case that says corporate defendants must pay damages even after proving that they could not possibly have caused the harm .
We can understand and share the compassion that makes judges sometimes wish to offer a kind of Solomonic aid to those who 've been hurt .
But this case is a stark lesson in how the failures of the traditional policy - making process have left the courts as the only forum this country has to debate risk , technology and innovation .
Too often now , a single court decision becomes the precedent for other , less compelling cases .
From the 1940s until 1971 , some two million women took the synthetic hormone diethylstilbestrol -LRB- DES -RRB- to prevent miscarriages and morning sickness .
The drug was approved by the Food and Drug Administration and marketed by some 300 pharmaceutical companies , often under generic labels .
In the 1970s , scientists reported cancer cases among the daughters of DES users .
The cases quickly went to court , but the mothers of several thousand DES plaintiffs could n't recall whose brand they used .
Beginning in 1980 , courts in several states including California and New York decided to suspend the common - law rule that plaintiffs must prove that the defendants are the ones who are liable .
Courts made the assumption that all DES pills were essentially the same , and created a market - share test so that damages would be assessed against drug makers in the proportion of their share of the original sales .
This has some logic .
Drug makers should n't be able to duck liability because people could n't identify precisely which identical drug was used .
But courts quickly tumbled down a slippery slope .
Just as all plaintiffs are not alike , it turns out that DES defendants marketed the drugs differently and may have offered different warranties .
The ultimate result came in Hymowitz v. Lilly , where the highest New York court expanded the market - share approach for the first time to say that drug makers that could prove Mindy Hymowitz 's mother did n't use their pill must still pay their share of any damages .
But as Duke University law professor William Van Alstyne notes , by this reasoning a defendant could be held liable in New York for a bad apple even if he sold all his apples in California .
Despite the Supreme Court 's refusal to hear the case , there are serious constitutional issues of due process and uncompensated takings from the defendants .
The big problem , however , is that there 's no guarantee that this reasoning will be limited to DES or to drugs .
The problem here goes well beyond twisting legal doctrine .
The California Supreme Court last year reversed direction to make it much harder to win DES cases because the justices saw how all the pharmaceutical litigation has chilled the introduction of new drugs .
The court rejected strict liability for prescription drugs , citing the huge , hidden social costs .
`` Public policy favors the development and marketing of beneficial new drugs , even though some risks , perhaps serious ones , might accompany their introduction because drugs can save lives and reduce pain and suffering , '' the unanimous court said .
The California justices noted that the fear of litigation already forced the only remaining anti-morning - sickness drug , Bendectin , off the U.S. market .
This raises the key issue : What to do about people who suffer serious injuries from beneficial drugs ?
We now know that holding drug makers liable where there 's no evidence that they or anyone else knew of any risks only means the drugs wo n't be available to anyone .
As liability expert Peter Huber tells us , after the Hymowitz case , if any drug maker introduces an anti-miscarriage drug `` it 's time to sell that company 's stock short . ''
We also know that the tort system is a lousy way to compensate victims anyway ; some win the legal lottery , others get much less and contingency - fee lawyers take a big cut either way .
DES daughters and other victims of drugs would be better off if their cases were taken out of the courts .
Congress could create a compensation program to help such victims while protecting the national interest in encouraging new drugs .
But a 1986 law that supposedly replaced lawsuits over children 's vaccines with a compensation fund has predictably led to even more litigation .
Everyone by now understands that Congress is utterly incapable of writing legislation to help deserving people without its becoming some billion - dollar morass .
We have no doubt this is one reason judges in New York and justices on the Supreme Court are willing to trash the law in the DES cases .
They must figure that justice has to get done by somebody , but know it wo n't be done by Congress .
The House passed legislation designed to make it easier for the Transportation Department to block airline leveraged buy - outs .
The final vote came after the House rejected Republican efforts to weaken the bill and approved two amendments sought by organized labor .
The Bush administration has threatened to veto such a bill because of what it views as an undesirable intrusion into the affairs of industry , but the 300 - 113 vote suggests that supporters have the potential to override a veto .
The broader question is where the Senate stands on the issue .
While the Senate Commerce Committee has approved legislation similar to the House bill on airline leveraged buy - outs , the measure has n't yet come to the full floor .
Although the legislation would apply to acquisitions involving any major airline , it is aimed at giving the Transportation Department the chance to review in advance transactions financed by large amounts of debt .
`` The purpose of the bill is to put the brakes on airline acquisitions that would so load a carrier up with debt that it would impede safety or a carrier 's ability to compete , '' Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt , -LRB- R. , Ark . -RRB- said .
The bill , as it was approved by the House Public Works and Transportation Committee , would give the Transportation Department up to 50 days to review any purchase of 15 % or more of the stock in an airline .
The department would be required to block the buy - out if the acquisition is likely to financially weaken a carrier so that safety would be impaired ; its ability to compete would be sharply diminished ; it would be put into foreign control ; or if the transaction would result in the sale of airline - related assets -- unless selling such assets had an overriding public benefit .
The House approved an amendment offered by Rep. Peter DeFazio -LRB- D. , Ore. -RRB- that would , in addition to the previous criteria , also require the department to block the acquisition of an airline if the added debt incurred were likely to result in a reduction in the number of the carrier 's employees , or their wages or benefits .
Rep. James Traficant -LRB- D. , Ohio -RRB- , said the amendment , which passed 271 - 147 , would `` let the American worker know that we consider them occasionally . ''
But Rep. Hammerschmidt said that the provision , which he dubbed a `` special interest '' amendment , was likely to make the bill even more controversial .
On Tuesday , the House approved a labor - backed amendment that would require the Transportation Department to reject airline acquisitions if the person seeking to purchase a carrier had run two or more airlines previously that have filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code .
The provision , called the `` two - time - losers '' amendment by its supporters , apparently was aimed at preventing Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo from attempting to take over another airline .
`` Feeding Frenzy '' -LRB- Henry Holt , 326 pages , $ 19.95 -RRB- , a highly detailed account of the Wedtech scandal , begins on a reassuring note .
Right up front in the preface , co-author William Sternberg gives us an example of his own integrity .
When offered a free trip from the Bronx , Wedtech 's home , to Washington , D.C. , by one of Wedtech 's principals , he tells the reader , `` mindful of accepting anything of value from those I was writing about , I declined . ''
Any question as to why an author would believe this plaintive , high - minded note of assurance is necessary is answered by reading this book about sticky fingers and sweaty scammers .
Bribe by bribe , Mr. Sternberg and his co-author , Matthew C. Harrison Jr. , lead us along the path Wedtech traveled , from its inception as a small manufacturing company to the status of full - fledged defense contractor , entrusted with the task of producing vital equipment for the Army and Navy .
The book revolves around John Mariotta , the founder of the company , and Fred Neuberger , who became his partner soon after Wedtech 's creation .
Although started in 1965 , Wedtech did n't really get rolling until 1975 , when Mr. Neuberger discovered the federal government 's Section 8 -LRB- A -RRB- minority business program .
This is a Johnson - era , Great Society creation that mandates certain government contracts be awarded noncompetitively to minority businesses .
Mr. Neuberger realized that , although of Italian ancestry , Mr. Mariotta still could qualify as a minority person since he was born in Puerto Rico .
The two partners merely had to falsify the true ownership of the corporation .
Instead of 50 / 50 it became , on paper only , two - thirds Mariotta , one - third Neuberger , and they were in the program and off to the races .
Besides being a `` minority - owned company '' Wedtech was located in the South Bronx , a blighted area , made famous by Jimmy Carter in his 1976 presidential campaign .
The company plugged itself right into Carter campaign rhetoric about rebuilding the South Bronx and kept using the minority -- South Bronx angle through the Reagan '80s .
Starting with Congressman Mario Biaggi -LRB- now serving a jail sentence -RRB- , the company began a career of bribing federal , state and local public officials and those close to public officials , right up to and including E. Robert Wallach , close friend and adviser to former Attorney General Ed Meese .
Wedtech did n't just use old fashioned bribery .
It made ample use of the modern techniques of influence peddling , retaining politically connected `` respectable '' law firms , investment bankers and political consultants , including Reagan confidant Lyn Nofzinger .
When necessary , it sought and received assistance from organized crime .
Sometimes the bribed became partners in the company .
Wedtech management used the merit system .
If you were especially helpful in a corrupt scheme you received not just cash in a bag , but equity .
If you were not an effective crook , you found yourself out in the cold , a fate that eventually befell Mr. Mariotta , the firm 's semiliterate `` minority '' person .
But despite the sensational nature of the revelations and the breezy , easy - to - read tabloid writing style , `` Feeding Frenzy '' often falls short of gripping reading .
None of the scams show much ingenuity : Auditors found crookery the first day on the job .
Wedtech 's scammers simply bribed them to shut up .
The scammers themselves were garden - variety low lifes , conspicuous consumers who wanted big houses , Mercedes cars , beautiful women , expensive clothes .
Among the lot of them , not one is wrestling with good and evil , or especially intelligent or even temporarily insane .
The one character at least somewhat interesting was Irving Louis Lobsenz , a pediatrician who changed his name to Rusty Kent London and became a master gambler and author of a book on blackjack .
He enters the story toward the end , just in time to get arrested .
Absorbed in doling out `` Feeding Frenzy 's '' tidbits , the authors gloss over the root causes of Wedtech , namely the Section 8 -LRB- A -RRB- federal program under whose auspices the scandal took place .
They do at least come around to saying that the courts might want to end `` rigid affirmative action programs . ''
Programs like Section 8 -LRB- A -RRB- are a little like leaving gold in the street and then expressing surprise when thieves walk by to scoop it up .
Numerous other scandals , among them the ones at HUD , have the same characteristics as Wedtech .
They take place in government programs that seem tailor - made for corruption .
Why are programs like this not eliminated ?
`` Feeding Frenzy '' does provide a few clues .
In and around all levels of government in the U.S. are groups of people who can best be described as belonging to a political insider commercial party .
They know that whenever government is redistributing wealth , regulating commerce or maintaining a large defense establishment , there is big money to be made in influencing , brokering or selling the processes and decisions of government .
They are our version of the East bloc 's Nomenklatura and they have absolutely no wish to see anything change .
How many government programs and policies exist because they line the pockets of political insiders ?
This is the real issue raised by the Wedtech scandal .
Mr. Stern was chairman and chief executive officer of the New York State Urban Development Corp. , 1983 - 85 .

If you 'd really rather have a Buick , do n't leave home without the American Express card .
Or so the slogan might go .
American Express Co. and General Motors Corp. 's beleaguered Buick division are joining forces in a promotion aimed at boosting Buick 's sales while encouraging broader use of the American Express card .
The companies are giving four - day vacations for two to Buick buyers who charge all or part of their down payments on the American Express green card .
They have begun sending letters explaining the program , which began Oct. 18 and will end Dec. 18 , to about five million card holders .
Neither company would disclose the program 's cost .
Buick approached American Express about a joint promotion because its card holders generally have a `` good credit history '' and are `` good at making payments , '' says a spokeswoman for the division .
American Express also represents the upscale image `` we 're trying to project , '' she adds .
Buick has been seeking for the past few years to restore its reputation as `` the doctor 's car '' -- a product for upscale professionals .
Sales were roughly flat in the 1989 model year compared with a year earlier , though industry sales fell .
But since the 1990 model year began Oct. 1 , Buick sales have plunged 33 % .
For American Express , the promotion is part of an effort to broaden the use of its card for retail sales , where the company expects to get much of the future growth in its card business .
Traditionally , the card has been used mainly for travel and entertainment expenses .
Phillip Riese , an American Express executive vice president , says the promotion with Buick is his company 's first with an auto maker , but `` hopefully -LCB- will be -RCB- the first of many '' in the company 's effort to promote its green card as `` the total car - care card . ''
To that end , American Express has been signing up gasoline companies , car repair shops , tire companies and car dealers to accept the card .
Many auto dealers now let car buyers charge part or all of their purchase on the American Express card , but few card holders realize this , Mr. Riese says .
Until now , however , buyers who wanted to finance part of a car purchase through General Motors Acceptance Corp. could n't put their down payment on a charge card because of possible conflicts with truth - in - lending and state disclosure laws over finance rates , says a spokesman for the GM finance arm .
But GMAC approved the Buick program , he says , because the American Express green card requires payment in full upon billing , and so does n't carry any finance rates .
Mr. Riese says American Express considers GM and Buick `` very sophisticated direct - mail marketers , '' so `` by joining forces with them we have managed to maximize our direct - mail capability . ''
In addition , Buick is a relatively respected nameplate among American Express card holders , says an American Express spokeswoman .
When the company asked members in a mailing which cars they would like to get information about for possible future purchases , Buick came in fourth among U.S. cars and in the top 10 of all cars , the spokeswoman says .
American Express has more than 24 million card holders in the U.S. , and over half have the green card .
GMAC screened the card - member list for holders more than 30 years old with household incomes over $ 45,000 who had n't `` missed any payments , '' the Buick spokeswoman says .
Some 3.8 million of the five million who will get letters were preapproved for credit with GMAC .
These 3.8 million people also are eligible to get one percentage point off GMAC 's advertised finance rates , which start at 6.9 % for two - year loan contracts .
A spokesman for Visa International 's U.S. subsidiary says his company is using promotions to increase use of its cards , but does n't have plans for a tie - in similar to the American Express - Buick link .
Three divisions at American Express are working with Buick on the promotion : the establishment services division , which is responsible for all merchants and companies that accept the card ; the travel division ; and the merchandise sales division .
The vacation packages include hotel accommodations and , in some cases , tours or tickets to local attractions , but not meals .
Destinations are Chicago ; Honolulu ; Las Vegas , Nev. ; Los Angeles ; Miami Beach , Fla. ; New Orleans ; New York ; Orlando , Fla. ; San Francisco ; and Washington , D.C.
A buyer who chooses to fly to his destination must pay for his own ticket but gets a companion 's ticket free if they fly on United Airlines .
In lieu of the vacation , buyers can choose among several prizes , including a grandfather clock or a stereo videocassette recorder .
Card holders who receive the letter also are eligible for a sweepstakes with Buick cars or a Hawaii vacation as prizes .
If they test - drive a Buick , they get an American Express calculator .
This is n't Buick 's first travel - related promotion .
A few years ago , the company offered two round - trip tickets on Trans World Airlines to buyers of its Riviera luxury car .
The promotion helped Riviera sales exceed the division 's forecast by more than 10 % , Buick said at the time .
Program trading is `` a racket , '' complains Edward Egnuss , a White Plains , N.Y. , investor and electronics sales executive , `` and it 's not to the benefit of the small investor , that 's for sure . ''
But although he thinks that it is hurting him , he doubts it could be stopped .
Mr. Egnuss 's dislike of program trading is echoed by many small investors interviewed by Wall Street Journal reporters across the country .
But like Mr. Egnuss , few expect it to be halted entirely , and a surprising number doubt it should be .
`` I think program trading is basically unfair to the individual investor , '' says Leo Fields , a Dallas investor .
He notes that program traders have a commission cost advantage because of the quantity of their trades , that they have a smaller margin requirement than individual investors do and that they often can figure out earlier where the market is heading .
But he blames program trading for only some of the market 's volatility .
He also considers the market overvalued and cites the troubles in junk bonds .
He adds : `` The market may be giving us another message , that a recession is looming . ''
Or , as Dorothy Arighi , an interior decorator in Arnold , Calif. , puts it : `` All kinds of funny things spook the market these days . ''
But she believes that `` program trading creates deviant swings .
It 's not a sound thing ; there 's no inherent virtue in it . ''
She adds that legislation curbing it would be `` a darned good idea . ''
At the Charles Schwab & Co. office in Atlanta 's Buckhead district , a group of investors voices skepticism that federal officials would curb program trading .
Citing the October 1987 crash , Glenn Miller says , `` It 's like the last crash -- they threatened , but no one did anything . ''
A. Donald Anderson , a 59 - year - old Los Angeles investor who says the stock market 's `` fluctuations and gyrations give me the heebie - jeebies , '' does n't see much point in outlawing program trading .
Those who still want to do it `` will just find some way to get around '' any attempt to curb it .
Similarly , Rick Wamre , a 31 - year - old asset manager for a Dallas real - estate firm , would like to see program trading disappear because `` I ca n't see that it does anything for the market or the country . ''
Yet he is n't in favor of new legislation .
`` I think we 've got enough securities laws , '' he says .
`` I 'd much rather see them dealing with interest rates and the deficit . ''
Peter Anthony , who runs an employment agency in New York , decries program trading as `` limiting the game to a few , '' but he also is n't sure it should be more strictly regulated .
`` I do n't want to denounce it because denouncing it would be like denouncing capitalism , '' he explains .
And surprising numbers of small investors seem to be adapting to greater stock market volatility and say they can live with program trading .
Glenn Britta , a 25 - year - old New York financial analyst who plays options for his personal account , says he is `` factoring '' the market 's volatility `` into investment decisions . ''
He adds that program trading `` increases liquidity in the market .
You ca n't hold back technology . ''
And the practice should n't be stopped , he says , because `` even big players are n't immune to the rigors of program trading . ''
Also in New York , Israel Silverman , an insurance - company lawyer , comments that program trading `` increases volatility , but I do n't think it should be banned .
There 's no culprit here .
The market is just becoming more efficient . ''
Arbitraging on differences between spot and futures prices is an important part of many financial markets , he says .
He adds that his shares in a company savings plan are invested in a mutual fund , and volatility , on a given day , may hurt the fund .
But `` I 'm a long - term investor , '' he says .
`` If you were a short - term investor , you might be more leery about program trading . ''
Jim Enzor of Atlanta defends program trading because he believes that it can bring the market back up after a plunge .
`` If we have a real bad day , the program would say , ` Buy , ' '' he explains .
`` If you could get the rhythm of the program trading , you could take advantage of it . ''
What else can a small investor do ?
Scott Taccetta , a Chicago accountant , is going into money - market funds .
Mr. Taccetta says he had just recouped the $ 5,000 he lost in the 1987 crash when he lost more money last Oct. 13 .
Now , he plans to sell all his stocks by the first quarter of 1990 .
In October , before the market dropped , Mrs. Arighi of Arnold , Calif. , moved to sell the `` speculative stocks '' in her family trust `` so we will be able to withstand all this flim - flammery '' caused by program trading .
She believes that the only answer for individuals is to `` buy stocks that 'll weather any storm . ''
Lucille Gorman , an 84 - year - old Chicago housewife , has become amazingly immune to stock - market jolts .
Mrs. Gorman took advantage of low prices after the 1987 crash to buy stocks and has hunted for other bargains since the Oct. 13 plunge .
`` My stocks are all blue chips , '' she says .
`` If the market goes down , I figure it 's paper profits I 'm losing .
On the other hand , if it goes way sky high , I always sell .
You do n't want to get yourself too upset about these things .

The record corn - buying binge by the Soviet Union is causing serious bottlenecks in the U.S. grain pipeline .
The Soviet purchases are so massive that exporters are struggling to find enough river barges and trains to move the recently harvested Midwest crop to ports for loading onto Soviet ships .
River barge rates have soared 40 % this fall from a year earlier .
Railroad companies and some ports are reaping a sudden windfall of business .
And some grain analysts are predicting that corn prices might gyrate this month as exporters scrounge to find enough of the crop to meet their obligations to the Soviets .
The Soviet Union bought roughly 310 million bushels of U.S. corn in October , which is the most ever sold to the Soviet Union in one month from the U.S. .
The Soviet Union wants much of it delivered by January , which would be a strain in most years .
But it is particularly difficult this autumn because of low water levels on the Mississippi River , on which flows much of the U.S. corn that is shipped overseas .
`` We are shipping the most corn in that short of time period to one customer on record , '' said William Dunton , a U.S. Agriculture Department transportation expert .
`` It is going to be real tight . ''
Because of persistent dry weather in the northern Plains , the water level on the upper section of the Mississippi River is so low that many river operators are already trimming the number of barges their tows push at one time .
In a few weeks , many barges probably wo n't be able to operate fully loaded south of St. Louis because the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is beginning to reduce the flow of the Missouri River , which feeds into the Mississippi River .
The Army Corps is cutting the flow of the Missouri River about two weeks earlier than normal because of low water levels in the reservoirs that feed it .
Barge rates on the Mississippi River sank yesterday on speculation that widespread rain this week in the Midwest might temporarily alleviate the situation .
But the Army Corps of Engineers expects the river level to continue falling this month .
At St. Louis , the water level of the Mississippi River is already 6.5 feet below normal and it could drop an additional 2.5 feet when the flow of the Missouri River is slowed , an Army Corps spokesman said .
Similar levels hamstrung barge shipments last year in the wake of the worst drought in 50 years .
So far , the grain industry 's budding logistical problems have n't been a major factor in the trading of corn contracts at the Chicago Board of Trade .
Many grain processors and exporters use the price of the corn futures contracts traded there to calculate the price they offer to buy corn from farmers .
At the Board of Trade yesterday the price of the corn contract for December delivery slipped 3.5 cents a bushel to settle at $ 2.375 a bushel .
Corn prices have been sluggish this fall despite the huge Soviet orders because the harvest has allowed farmers to rebuild the stockpiles depleted by the 1988 drought .
With the harvest winding down , however , some analysts are speculating that prices might jump in some regions as U.S. exporters try to gather the corn they are obligated to deliver .
Farmers are in the best position of many years to push up corn prices .
Because the drought reduced U.S. stockpiles , they have more than enough storage space for their new crop , and that permits them to wait for prices to rise .
In parts of Iowa , for example , some grain elevators are offering farmers $ 2.15 a bushel for corn .
Many farmers probably would n't sell until prices rose at least 20 cents a bushel , said Lyle Reed , president of Chicago Central & Pacific Railroad Co. of Waterloo , Iowa .
It is n't clear , however , who would win a waiting game .
Although U.S. corn stockpiles shrank by roughly half in the wake of the drought , the Agriculture Department projects that nearly one - fifth of the harvest will still be in storage before the 1990 corn harvest begins .
Some analysts are worried that reports of the grain industry 's problems might spark investors to begin buying corn futures contracts -- only to see little appreciation .
`` The public is buying the market when in reality there is plenty of grain to be shipped , '' said Bill Biedermann , Allendale Inc. research director .
Although much of this country 's export corn goes to New Orleans by barge , it is possible for exporters to sidestep the Mississippi River by shipping a larger - than - normal amount of corn by train to the port .
Ports in the Great Lakes and Atlantic Coast can also relieve pressure on New Orleans .
One railroad , for example , is already increasing its grain hauling service from Indiana to Baltimore .
And it is n't clear that the Soviet Union will stay on its record buying pace .
The Soviet orders were compressed into the month of October because of delays .
The Soviet Union usually begins buying U.S. crops earlier in the fall .
But its purchases apparently were delayed by a reorganization of its agricultural bureaucracy as well as budget problems .
In other commodity markets yesterday :
ENERGY : Crude oil futures prices increased in moderate trading , but much of the action was in heating oil .
Prices rose on the news that a sizable West German refinery was damaged in a fire , tightening an already tight European market .
Heating oil for November delivery ended at 58.64 cents a gallon , up one cent on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
West Texas Intermediate for December delivery advanced 22 cents to $ 19.94 a barrel .
Gasoline futures continued a sell - off that began Monday .
PRECIOUS METALS : Futures prices eased as increased stability and strength came into the securities markets .
December delivery gold fell $ 3.20 an ounce to $ 377.60 .
December silver declined 6.50 cents an ounce to $ 5.2180 .
January platinum was down $ 5.70 an ounce at $ 494.50 .
Precious metals , gold in particular , currently are being influenced more by stock market gyrations than the dollar as traders seek greater investment stability , according to William O'Neill , vice president of research at Elders Futures in New York .
`` The recent rally in precious metals was a result of uncertainty and volatility in equities , '' he said .
Yesterday , the stock market rose strongly , creating a more defensive attitude among precious metals traders , he said .
Silver and platinum , which have more of an industrial nature than gold , were even weaker , he said .
Silver is also under pressure of `` extremely high '' inventories in warehouses of the Commodity Exchange , he said .
Yesterday , these stocks rose by 170,262 ounces to a record of 226,570,380 ounces , according to an exchange spokesman .
COPPER : Futures prices partially recovered Monday 's declines because Chilean miners voted to strike .
The December contract rose 1.20 cents a pound to $ 1.14 .
In Chile , workers at two copper mines , Los Bronces and El Soldado , which belong to the Exxon - owned Minera Disputada , yesterday voted to begin a full strike tomorrow , an analyst said .
Reasons for the walkout , the analyst said , included a number of procedural issues , such as a right to strike .
The analyst noted that also inherent in all metal markets was a sympathetic reaction to stocks .
In the case of copper , he said , the upbeat mood of stocks was reflected in demand for futures contracts because a stronger economy means greater buying interest for the metal .
Also contributing to the firmness in copper , the analyst noted , was a report by Chicago purchasing agents , which precedes the full purchasing agents ' report that is due out today and gives an indication of what the full report might hold .
The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago 's October index rose to 51.6 % after three previous months of readings below 50 % .
The September index was 47.1 % .
A reading below 50 % generally indicates a slowing in the industrial sector of the economy , while a reading above 50 % points to expansion .
The Chicago report raised the possibility that the October survey of the National Association of Purchasing Management would also show a reading above 50 % .

Despite one of the most devastating droughts on record , net cash income in the Farm Belt rose to a new high of $ 59.9 billion last year .
The previous record was $ 57.7 billion in 1987 , according to the Agriculture Department .
Net cash income -- the amount left in farmers ' pockets after deducting expenses from gross cash income -- increased in 33 states in 1988 , as the drought cut into crop yields and drove up commodity prices , the department 's Economic Research Service reported yesterday .
Most of those states set farm income records .
The worst crop damage occurred in the Midwestern Corn Belt and the northern Great Plains .
What saved many farmers from a bad year was the opportunity to reclaim large quantities of grain and other crops that they had `` mortgaged '' to the government under price - support loan programs .
With prices soaring , they were able to sell the reclaimed commodities at `` considerable profit , '' the agency 's 240 - page report said .
In less parched areas , meanwhile , farmers who had little or no loss of production profited greatly from the higher prices .
To the surprise of some analysts , net cash income rose in some of the hardest - hit states , including Indiana , Illinois , Nebraska and the Dakotas .
Analysts attributed the increases partly to the $ 4 billion disaster - assistance package enacted by Congress .
Last year 's record net cash income confirms the farm sector 's rebound from the agricultural depression of the early 1980s .
It also helps explain the reluctance of the major farm lobbies and many lawmakers to make any significant changes in the 1985 farm program next year .
Commodity prices have been rising in recent years , with the farm price index hitting record peaks earlier this year , as the government curtailed production with land - idling programs to reduce price - depressing surpluses .
At the same time , export demand for U.S. wheat , corn and other commodities strengthened , said Keith Collins , a department analyst .
Farmers also benefited from strong livestock prices , as the nation 's cattle inventory dropped close to a 30 - year low .
`` All of these forces came together in 1988 to benefit agriculture , '' Mr. Collins said .
California led the nation with $ 6.5 billion in net cash income last year , followed by Texas , $ 3.9 billion ; Iowa , $ 3.4 billion ; Florida , $ 3.1 billion ; and Minnesota , $ 2.7 billion .
Iowa and Minnesota were among the few major farm states to log a decline in net cash income .
Despite federal disaster relief , the drought of 1988 was a severe financial setback for an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 farmers , according to the department .
Many lost their farms .
Department economists do n't expect 1989 to be as good a year as 1988 was .
Indeed , net cash income is likely to fall this year as farm expenses rise and government payments to farmers decline .
At the same time , an increase of land under cultivation after the drought has boosted production of corn , soybeans and other commodities , causing a fall in prices that has been only partly cushioned by heavy grain buying by the Soviets .
Last year , government payments to farmers slipped to less than $ 14.5 billion from a record $ 16.7 billion in 1987 .
Payments are expected to range between $ 9 billion and $ 12 billion this year .
Rep. John Dingell , an important sponsor of President Bush 's clean - air bill , plans to unveil a surprise proposal that would break with the White House on a centerpiece issue : acid rain .
The Michigan Democrat 's proposal , which is expected today , is described by government sources and lobbyists as significantly weaker than the Bush administration 's plan to cut utility emissions that lead to acid rain .
The administration 's plan could cost utilities , mainly those that use coal , up to $ 4 billion a year .
The proposal comes as a surprise even to administration officials and temporarily throws into chaos the House 's work on clean - air legislation .
As chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee , Mr. Dingell has almost single - handed control over clean - air legislation .
People close to the utility industry said Mr. Dingell 's proposal appears to guarantee only an estimated seven - million - ton cut in annual sulfur - dioxide emissions that lead to acid rain , though additional cuts could be ordered later .
Mr. Bush 's legislative package promises to cut emissions by 10 million tons -- basically in half -- by the year 2000 .
Although final details were n't available , sources said the Dingell plan would abandon the president 's proposal for a cap on utilities ' sulfur - dioxide emissions .
That proposal had been hailed by environmentalists but despised by utilities because they feared it would limit their growth .
It also would junk an innovative market - based system for trading emissions credits among polluters .
In addition , it is believed to offer a cost - sharing mechanism that would help subsidize the clean - up costs for the dirtiest coal - fired utilities in the country , sparing their customers from exorbitant jumps in their electric bills .
The administration , sticking to its vow of avoiding tax increases , has staunchly opposed cost - sharing .
Mr. Dingell 's staff was expected to present its acid - rain alternative to other committee members , apparently in an attempt to appease Midwestern lawmakers from high - polluting states who insist on cost - sharing .
It is n't clear , however , whether support for the proposal will be broad enough to pose a serious challenge to the White House 's acid - rain plan .
While the new proposal might appeal to the dirtiest utilities , it might not win the support of utilities , many in the West , that already have added expensive cleanup equipment or burn cleaner - burning fuels .
Lawmakers representing some of the cleaner utilities have been quietly working with the White House to devise ways to tinker with the administration bill to address their acid - rain concerns .
Beauty Takes Backseat To Safety on Bridges
EVERYONE AGREES that most of the nation 's old bridges need to be repaired or replaced .
But there 's disagreement over how to do it .
Highway officials insist the ornamental railings on older bridges are n't strong enough to prevent vehicles from crashing through .
But other people do n't want to lose the bridges ' beautiful , sometimes historic , features .
`` The primary purpose of a railing is to contain a vehicle and not to provide a scenic view , '' says Jack White , a planner with the Indiana Highway Department .
He and others prefer to install railings such as the `` type F safety shape , '' a four - foot - high concrete slab with no openings .
In Richmond , Ind. , the type F railing is being used to replace arched openings on the G Street Bridge .
Garret Boone , who teaches art at Earlham College , calls the new structure `` just an ugly bridge '' and one that blocks the view of a new park below .
In Hartford , Conn. , the Charter Oak Bridge will soon be replaced , the cast - iron medallions from its railings relegated to a park .
Compromises are possible .
Citizens in Peninsula , Ohio , upset over changes to a bridge , negotiated a deal : The bottom half of the railing will be type F , while the top half will have the old bridge 's floral pattern .
Similarly , highway engineers agreed to keep the old railings on the Key Bridge in Washington , D.C. , as long as they could install a crash barrier between the sidewalk and the road .

Drink Carrier Competes With Cartons
PORTING POTABLES just got easier , or so claims Scypher Corp. , the maker of the Cup - Tote .
The Chicago company 's beverage carrier , meant to replace cardboard trays at concession stands and fast - food outlets , resembles the plastic loops used on six - packs of beer , only the loops hang from a web of strings .
The new carrier can tote as many as four cups at once .
Inventor Claire Marvin says his design virtually eliminates spilling .
Lids are n't even needed .
He also claims the carrier costs less and takes up less space than most paper carriers .
A few fast - food outlets are giving it a try .
The company acknowledges some problems .
A driver has to find something to hang the carrier on , so the company supplies a window hook .
While it breaks down in prolonged sunlight , it is n't recyclable .
And unlike some trays , there 's no place for food .
Spirit of Perestroika Touches Design World
AN EXCHANGE of U.S. and Soviet designers promises change on both sides .
An exhibition of American design and architecture opened in September in Moscow and will travel to eight other Soviet cities .
The show runs the gamut , from a blender to chairs to a model of the Citicorp building .
The event continues into next year and includes an exchange program to swap design teachers at Carnegie - Mellon and Leningrad 's Mutchin Institute .
Dan Droz , leader of the Carnegie - Mellon group , sees benefits all around .
The Soviets , who normally have few clients other than the state , will get `` exposure to a market system , '' he says .
Americans will learn more about making products for the Soviets .
Mr. Droz says the Soviets could even help U.S. designers renew their sense of purpose .
`` In Moscow , they kept asking us things like , ` Why do you make 15 different corkscrews , when all you need is one good one ? ' '' he says .
`` They got us thinking maybe we should be helping U.S. companies improve existing products rather than always developing new ones . ''
Seed for Jail Solution Fails to Take Root
IT 'S A TWO BIRDS with one stone deal : Eggers Group architects propose using grain elevators to house prisoners .
It would ease jail overcrowding while preserving historic structures , the company says .
But New York state , which is seeking solutions to its prison cell shortage , says `` no . ''
Grain elevators built in the 1920s and '30s have six - inch concrete walls and a tubular shape that would easily contain semicircular cells with a control point in the middle , the New York firm says .
Many are far enough from residential areas to pass public muster , yet close enough to permit family visits .
Besides , Eggers says , grain elevators are worth preserving for aesthetic reasons -- one famed architect compared them to the pyramids of Egypt .
A number of cities -- including Minneapolis , Philadelphia and Houston -- have vacant grain elevators , Eggers says .
A medium - sized one in Brooklyn , it says , could be altered to house up to 1,000 inmates at a lower cost than building a new prison in upstate New York .
A spokesman for the state , however , calls the idea `` not effective or cost efficient .
Lewis C. Veraldi , the father of the team that created the highly successful Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable cars , retired early after experiencing recent heart problems .
Most recently , Mr. Veraldi , 59 years old , has been vice president of product and manufacturing engineering at Ford Motor Co .
But he is best known in the auto industry as the creator of a team car - development approach that produced the two midsized cars that were instrumental in helping the No. 2 auto maker record profits in recent years and in enabling the company 's Ford division to eclipse General Motors Corp. 's Chevrolet division as the top - selling nameplate in the U.S. .
Under the so - called Team Taurus approach , Mr. Veraldi and other Ford product planners sought the involvement of parts suppliers , assembly - line workers , auto designers and financial staff members from the initial stages of the development cycle .
The concept 's goal was to eliminate bureaucracy and make Ford 's product development more responsive to consumer demands .
It was later applied to other new - car programs , including those that produced the Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar .
Ford Chairman Donald E. Petersen said yesterday that Mr. Veraldi has `` helped to change the world 's perception of American - made cars . ''
Mr. Veraldi worked at Ford for 40 years , holding a variety of car and parts - engineering positions .
The U.S. International Trade Commission issued preliminary rulings under the U.S. anti-dumping act that imports of sweaters from Hong Kong , Taiwan and South Korea may be injuring a domestic industry .
Because of the rulings , the Commerce Department will continue to investigate complaints by U.S. sweater makers that the imports are reaching the U.S. at unfairly low prices in violation of the U.S. anti-dumping act .
The law defines unfairly low prices as ones below the cost of production or below prices in an exporter 's home market .
ITC officials said final Commerce Department and ITC rulings wo n't come until next March or later .
If both agencies find violations of the U.S. trade law , the U.S. would assess penalty duties on the imports , which already are subject to import quotas under bilateral textile and apparel trade agreements .
Imports of manmade - fiber sweaters in 1988 totaled about $ 405 million from Taiwan , $ 400 million from South Korea and $ 125 million from Hong Kong , according to the ITC .
In another action , the ITC dismissed anti-dumping act complaints filed by Du Pont Co. of Wilmington , Del. , against imports of neoprene , a type of synthetic rubber , from France and West Germany .
These imports totaled about $ 17 million last year .

The British Department of Trade and Industry ordered an investigation of the competitive impact of Michelin Tyre PLC 's planned acquisition of National Tyre Service Ltd .
The department said it referred the takeover to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission because of the purchase 's possible effects on the U.K. market for distribution of replacement tires .
BTR PLC , a U.K. industrial conglomerate , said in June it had sold its National Tyre Service business to Michelin Investment Ltd. , a U.K. unit of the tire maker , for # 140 million -LRB- $ 221.4 million -RRB- .
Michelin Tyre is a unit of France 's Michelin S.A .
Michelin officials could n't immediately comment on the referral , but they noted the purchase from BTR has already been concluded .
National Tyre , which has 420 branches throughout the U.K. , had 1988 pretax profit of # 8.5 million .
First Chicago Corp. said it completed its $ 55.1 million cash - and - stock acquisition of closely held Ravenswood Financial Corp. , another Chicago bank holding company .
Genetics Institute Inc. , Cambridge , Mass. , said it was awarded U.S. patents for Interleukin - 3 and bone morphogenetic protein .
The patent for Interleukin - 3 covers materials and methods used to make the human blood cell growth factor via recombinant DNA technology .
Sandoz Ltd. has licensed certain manufacturing and marketing rights for Interleukin - 3 from Genetics Institute and is conducting preclinical studies with it .
Interleukin - 3 may help in treating blood cell deficiencies associated with cancer treatment , bone marrow transplants and other blood - cell disorders , Genetics Institute said .
The second patent describes bone morphogenetic protein - 1 , a substance that can induce formation of new cartilage .
The patent covers BMP - 1 type proteins and pharmaceutical compositions and methods for treating bone or cartilage defects , Genetics Institute said .
The company added that it has filed patent applications `` on a large number of different BMP proteins '' and the patent on BMP - 1 is the first it has received .
BMP products may be useful in fracture healing and in treating bone loss associated with periodontal disease and certain cancers , the company said .

Several moves were taken following the October 1987 crash to coordinate -- and sometimes deliberately disconnect -- the stock and futures markets in times of heightened volatility .
On the Big Board , a `` side car '' is put into effect when the S&P futures rise or fall 12 points .
The side car routes program trades into a special computer file that scans for imbalances of buy and sell orders .
On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , S&P 500 futures are not allowed to fall further than 12 points from the previous day 's close for half an hour .
If , when trading resumes , the S&P futures fall 30 points from the previous day 's close , a one - hour trading halt takes effect .
Also , the reforms allow the Big Board to halt trading for one hour if the Dow Jones Industrial Average falls 250 points , and for two more hours if the Dow slides an additional 150 points on the same day .
DOT System -- The `` Designated Order Turnaround '' System was launched by the New York Stock Exchange in March 1976 , to offer automatic , high - speed order processing .
A faster version , the SuperDot , was launched in 1984 .
Used by program traders and others to zip orders into the exchange , SuperDot handles about 80 % of all orders entered at the exchange .
Futures Contracts -- Obligations to buy -LRB- for those who have purchased a contract -RRB- or deliver -LRB- for those who sold one -RRB- a quantity of the underlying commodity or financial instrument at the agreed - upon price by a certain date .
Most contracts are simply nullified by an opposite trade before they come due .
Indexing -- Many investors , mainly institutions , follow an investment strategy of buying and holding a mix of stocks to match the performance of a broad stock - market barometer such as the S&P 500 .
Many institutional index funds are active program traders , swapping their stocks for futures when profitable to do so .
Program trading -- A wide range of computer - assisted portfolio trading strategies involving the simultaneous purchase or sale of 15 or more stocks .
Quant -- Generally , any Wall Street analyst who employs quantitive research techniques .
The newest breed , also called `` rocket scientists '' because of their backgrounds in physics and mathematics , devise the complex hedging and trading strategies that are popularly known as program trading .
Stock - index arbitrage -- Buying or selling baskets of stocks while at the same time executing offsetting trades in stock - index futures or options .
Traders profit by trying to capture fleeting price discrepancies between stocks and the index futures or options .
If stocks are temporarily `` cheaper '' than futures , for example , an arbitrager will buy stocks and sell futures .
Stock - index futures -- Contracts to buy or sell the cash value of a stock index by a certain date .
The cash value is determined by multiplying the index number by a specified amount .
The most common program - trading vehicles are futures contracts on Standard & poor 's 500 - stock index -LRB- traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange -RRB- ; the Major Market Index , a 20 - stock index that mimics the Dow Jones Industrial Average -LRB- traded on the chicago Board of Trade -RRB- ; and the S&P 100 options -LRB- traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , and based on 100 stocks selected from the S&P 500 -RRB- .
Stock - index options -- Options give holders the right , but not the obligation , to buy -LRB- a call -RRB- or sell -LRB- a put -RRB- a specified amount of an underlying investment by a certin date at a preset price , known as the strike price .
For stock indexes , the underlying investment may be a stock - index futures contract or the cash value of a stock index .
For example , there are options on the S&P 500 futures contract and on the S&P 100 index .
Uptick -- An expression signifying that a transaction in a listed security occurred at a higher price than the previous transaction in that security .
Dell Computer Corp. said it cut prices on several of its personal computer lines by 5 % to 17 % .
The Austin , Texas - based company , which specializes in the direct sale of personal computers and accessories , said its price cuts include a $ 100 reduction on its System 210 computer with 512 kilobytes of memory , a 40 - megabyte hard disk and a color monitor .
That package now sells for about $ 2,099 .
A computer using the more - advanced Intel Corp. 386 microprocessor , with four megabytes of memory and a 100 - megabyte hard disk now sells for $ 5,699 , down from $ 6,799 .
Personal computer prices for models using the Intel 286 and 386 microprocessors , which the Dell models use , generally have been coming down as chip prices have fallen .
Freeport - McMoRan Inc. said it will convert its Freeport - McMoRan Energy Partners Ltd. partnership into a publicly traded company through the exchange of units of the partnership for common shares .
The company said the restructuring is n't expected to have any impact , adverse or otherwise , on its financial results .
Freeport - McMoRan , a New Orleans - based diversified energy conglomerate , said the partnership will exchange its assets for common shares of a yet - to - be - formed entity .
Freeport - McMoRan Energy Partners will be liquidated and shares of the new company distributed to the partnership 's unitholders .
Unitholders will receive two additional 55 cents - a - unit distribution payments before the trust is liquidated in early 1990 , the company said .
It is expected that common shares equal to the number of units outstanding -- about 108 million on Sept. 30 -- will be issued during the first quarter of 1990 .
Freeport - McMoRan , the parent company , holds roughly 80 % of the units outstanding .
A House - Senate conference approved major portions of a package for more than $ 500 million in economic aid for Poland that relies heavily on $ 240 million in credit and loan guarantees in fiscal 1990 in hopes of stimulating future trade and investment .
For the Agency for International Development , appropriators approved $ 200 million in secondary loan guarantees under an expanded trade credit insurance program , and total loan guarantees for the Overseas Private Investment Corp. are increased by $ 40 million over fiscal 1989 as part of the same Poland package .
The conference approved at least $ 55 million in direct cash and development assistance as well , and though no decision was made , both sides are committed to adding more than $ 200 million in economic support funds and environmental initiatives sought by the Bush administration .
The agreement on Poland contrasts with the major differences remaining over the underlying foreign aid bill , which has already provoked veto threats by the White House and is sharply confined under this year 's budget .
These fiscal pressures are also a factor in shaping the Poland package , and while more ambitious authorizing legislation is still pending , the appropriations bill in conference will be more decisive on U.S. aid to Eastern Europe .
To accommodate the additional cash assistance , the House Appropriations Committee last week was required to reallocate an estimated $ 140 million from the Pentagon .
And though the size of the loan guarantees approved yesterday is significant , recent experience with a similar program in Central America indicates that it could take several years before the new Polish government can fully use the aid effectively .
The action on Poland came as the conference separately approved $ 220 million for international population planning activities , an 11 % increase over fiscal 1989 .
The House and Senate are divided over whether the United Nations Population Fund will receive any portion of these appropriations , but the size of the increase is itself significant .
In a second area of common concern , the world environment , an additional $ 15 million will be provided in development assistance to fund a series of initiatives , related both to global warming and the plight of the African elephant .
The sweeping nature of the bill draws a variety of special interest amendments , running from an import exemption for a California airplane museum to a small but intriguing struggle among sugar producing nations over the fate of Panama 's quota of exports to the profitable U.S. market .
Panama was stripped of this right because of U.S. differences with the Noriega regime , but the Central American country would have received a quota of 30,537 metric tons over a 21 - month period ending Sept. 30 , 1990 .
About a quarter of this share has already been reallocated , according to the industry , but the remaining 23,403 tons are still a lucrative target for growers because the current U.S. price of 18 cents a pound runs as much as a nickel a pound above the world rate .
The potential sales are nearly $ 9.3 million , and House Majority Whip William Gray -LRB- D. , Pa . -RRB- began the bidding this year by proposing language that the quota be allocated to English - speaking countries of the Caribbean , such as Jamaica and Barbados .
Rep. Jerry Lewis , a conservative Californian , added a provision of his own intended to assist Bolivia , and the Senate then broadened the list further by including all countries in the U.S. Caribbean Basin initiate as well as the Philippines - backed by the powerful Hawaii Democrat Sen. Daniel Inouye .
Jamaica , wary of upsetting its Caribbean Basin allies , has apparently instructed its lobbyist to abandon the provision initially drafted by Mr. Gray , but the greater question is whether Mr. Inouye , who has strong ties to the sugar industry , is able to insert a claim by the Philippines .
In separate floor action , the House waived budget restrictions and gave quick approval to $ 3.18 billion in supplemental appropriations for law enforcement and anti-drug programs in fiscal 1990 .
The funding is attached to an estimated $ 27.1 billion transportation bill that goes next to the Senate and carries with it a proposed permanent smoking ban on virtually all U.S. domestic airline flights .
The leadership hopes to move the compromise measure promptly to the White House , but in recent days , the Senate has been as likely to bounce bills back to the House .
The most recent example was a nearly $ 17.3 billion fiscal 1990 bill funding the State , Justice and Commerce departments .
And after losing a battle Tuesday night with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , appropriators from both houses are expected to be forced back to conference .

Congress learned during the Reagan administration that it could intimidate the executive branch by uttering again and again the same seven words : `` Provided , that no funds shall be spent ... . ''
This phrase once again is found throughout the many appropriations bills now moving through Congress .
It signals Congress 's attempt , under the pretext of guarding the public purse , to deny the president the funding necessary to execute certain of his duties and prerogatives specified in Article II of the Constitution .
This species of congressional action is predicated on an interpretation of the appropriations clause that is erroneous and unconstitutional .
The appropriations clause states that `` No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury , but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law ... . ''
The prevailing interpretation of the clause on Capitol Hill is that it gives Congress an omnipresent veto over every conceivable action of the president through the ability to withhold funding .
This interpretation was officially endorsed by Congress in 1987 in the Iran - Contra Report .
As partisans of congressional power understand , a `` power of the purse '' so broadly construed would emasculate the presidency and swallow the principle of separation of powers .
It is not supported by the text or history of the Constitution .
The framers hardly discussed the appropriations clause at the Constitutional Convention of 1787 , according to Madison 's notes .
To the extent they did , their concern was to ensure fiscal accountability .
Moreover , the framers believed that the nation needed a unitary executive with the independence and resources to perform the executive functions that the Confederation Congress had performed poorly under the Articles of Confederation .
It would contradict that objective if the appropriations clause -LRB- technically a limitation on legislative power -RRB- could be read as placing the president on Congress 's short leash , making the executive consist of the president and every member of Congress .
As it went to the conference panel now deliberating , the appropriations bill for the executive office of the president for fiscal 1990 contained some breathtaking attempts by Congress to rewrite the Constitution under the pretext of protecting the public 's money .
During the coming weeks , President Bush must decide whether to veto the bills containing them -- or , alternatively , to sign these bills into law with a statement declaring their intrusions on executive power to be in violation of Article II , and thus void and severable .
The 1990 appropriations legislation attempts to strip the president of his powers to make certain appointments as provided by Article II .
Article II places on the president the duty to nominate , `` and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate '' appoint , ambassadors , judges , and other officers of the U.S. .
It also empowers the president to make recess appointments , without Senate approval : `` The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate , by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session . ''
Yet Section 605 of the appropriations bill for the executive office provides : `` No part of any appropriation for the current fiscal year contained in this or any other Act shall be paid to any person for the filling of any position for which he or she has been nominated after the Senate has voted not to approve the nomination of said person . ''
Thus , with one brief passage in an appropriations bill , Congress repeals the president 's power to make recess appointments under Article II .
Section 605 also imposes unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to nominate candidates of his choosing .
The language of the appropriations rider implies that any nomination to any position of a rejected nominee will result in the president being denied funding to pay that person 's salary .
The president could probably not avoid this restriction by choosing people willing to serve without pay , because the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits voluntary service to the government .
The 1990 appropriations bills also contain a number of `` muzzling '' provisions that violate the recommendation clause in Article II of the Constitution .
Muzzling provisions , which might be called `` blindfold laws '' as well , prevent the executive branch from even looking at certain policy options , let alone from recommending them to Congress .
Such laws violate the provision in Article II that requires the president to make recommendations to Congress , but which gives the president the discretion to select the subject matter of those recommendations .
Typically , these laws seek to prevent executive branch officials from inquiring into whether certain federal programs make any economic sense or proposing more market - oriented alternatives to regulations .
Probably the most egregious example is a proviso in the appropriations bill for the executive office that prevents the president 's Office of Management and Budget from subjecting agricultural marketing orders to any cost - benefit scrutiny .
There is something inherently suspect about Congress 's prohibiting the executive from even studying whether public funds are being wasted in some favored program or other .
Perhaps none of the unconstitutional conditions contained in the appropriations bills for fiscal 1990 better illustrates Congress 's attempt to usurp executive power than Section 609 of the executive - office bill : `` None of the funds made available pursuant to the provisions of this Act shall be used to implement , administer , or enforce any regulation which has been disapproved pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly adopted in accordance with the applicable law of the United States . ''
This provision amounts to a legislative veto over the president 's execution of the law , since a one - house resolution could be said to be `` duly adopted '' even though it would require neither bicameral action in Congress nor presentation to the president for his signature or veto .
The Supreme Court 's decision in INS v. Chadha held that legislative vetoes are unconstitutional .
President Bush should veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to discharge his duties and exercise his prerogatives .
If President Bush fails to do so in his first year , he will invite Congress , for the remainder of his presidency , to rewrite Article II of the Constitution to suit its purposes .
What becomes custom in the Bush administration will only become more difficult for future presidents , including Democrats , to undo .
President Reagan learned that lesson .
By 1987 , then - Speaker Jim Wright was discussing arms control in Moscow with Mikhail Gorbachev and then attempting to direct the president , through an appropriations rider , to treat the Soviets as though the Senate had ratified SALT II .
If a veto is unworkable because it would leave part of the executive branch unfunded , the president could sign the appropriations bills into law and assert a power of excision , declaring the rider restricting his Article II powers to be unconstitutional and severable .
The Constitution does not expressly give the president such power .
However , the president does have a duty not to violate the Constitution .
The question is whether his only means of defense is the veto .
Excision of appropriations riders that trespass on the president 's duties and prerogative under Article II would be different from the line - item veto .
As discussed in the context of controlling federal spending , the line - item veto is characterized as a way for the president to excise perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that are objectionable merely because they conflict with his policy objectives .
The excision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited applicability .
One could argue that it is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the president , by exerting a power of excision , to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers .
There is no downside if the president asserts a right of excision over unconstitutional conditions in the fiscal 1990 appropriations bills .
If Congress does nothing , President Bush will have won .
If Congress takes the dispute to the Supreme Court -LRB- assuming it can establish standing to sue -RRB- , President Bush might win .
In that case , he might receive an opinion from the court that is a vindication of the president 's right to perform the duties and exercise the prerogatives the framers thought should be entrusted to the executive .
If President Bush loses at the court , it might be disappointing , as Morrison v. Olson was for the Reagan administration .
But the presidency would be no worse off than it is now .
Moreover , the electorate would have received a valuable civics lesson in how the separation of powers works in practice .
As it stands now , Congress presumes after the Reagan administration that the White House will take unconstitutional provisions in appropriations bills lying down .
President Bush should set things straight .
If he does not , he will help realize Madison 's fear in The Federalist No. 48 of a legislature `` everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all powers into its impetuous vortex . ''

American City Business Journals Inc. said its president , Michael K. Russell , will resign rather than relocate to new headquarters in Charlotte , N.C .
Mr. Russell , who co-founded the Kansas City , Mo. - based local business publications concern here , said he would have a five - year consulting agreement with the company , which recently underwent an ownership change .
Earlier this year Shaw Publishing Inc. , Charlotte , acquired 30 % of American City and has an agreement to acquire a further 25 % from E.W. Scripps Co. next year .
Ray Shaw , chairman of American City , said he would assume Mr. Russell 's responsibilities if a successor is n't found this month .
Carnival Cruise Lines Inc. said potential problems with the construction of two big cruise ships from Finland have been averted .
Last week , Miami - based Carnival disclosed that Waertsilae Marine Industries , the Finnish shipyard that is building Carnival 's new cruise ships , planned to file for bankruptcy .
Yesterday , Carnival said a new company has been formed in Finland that will carry on Waertsilae 's shipbuilding operations .
Carnival said it will be an 11 % shareholder in the new company .
Carnival said the Fantasy , a 2,050 - passenger ship that was slated to be delivered this month , will be delivered in January .
A second ship is now expected to be delivered late next year or early in 1991 .
Carnival had expected that ship to be delivered next fall .
A planned third ship still may be built in the Finnish shipyard , or may be built elsewhere , Carnival said .
The parent of Younkers , after failing to find a buyer for the chain of Midwestern department stores , said it will sell a stake in the chain to management and take other steps to reduce its investment in retailing .
Equitable of Iowa Cos. , Des Moines , had been seeking a buyer for the 36 - store Younkers chain since June , when it announced its intention to free up capital to expand its insurance business .
But Equitable said it was unable to find a buyer willing to pay what it considers `` fair value '' for Younkers because of recent turmoil in the bond and stock markets and in retailing .
Younkers rang up sales in 1988 of $ 313 million .
It operates stores mostly in Iowa and Nebraska .
Younkers management is likely to buy a 10 % to 20 % interest in the chain in January , said Fred S. Hubbell , Equitable 's president and chief executive officer .
He said Equitable hopes to eventually reduce its stake in Younkers to less than 50 % .
The Labor Department cited USX Corp. for numerous health and safety violations at two Pennsylvania plants , and proposed $ 7.3 million in fines , the largest penalty ever proposed for alleged workplace violations by an employer .
The department 's Occupational Safety and Health Administration proposed fines of $ 6.1 million for alleged violations at the company 's Fairless Hills , Pa. , steel mill ; that was a record for proposed penalties at any single facility .
OSHA cited nearly 1,500 alleged violations of federal electrical , crane - safety , record - keeping and other requirements .
A second citation covering the company 's Clairton , Pa. , coke works involved more than 200 alleged violations of electrical - safety and other requirements , for which OSHA proposed $ 1.2 million in fines .
Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said , `` The magnitude of these penalties and citations is matched only by the magnitude of the hazards to workers which resulted from corporate indifference to worker safety and health , and severe cutbacks in the maintenance and repair programs needed to remove those hazards . ''
OSHA said there have been three worker fatalities at the two plants in the past two years and 17 deaths since 1972 .
Gerard Scannell , the head of OSHA , said USX managers have known about many of the safety and health deficiencies at the plants for years , `` yet have failed to take necessary action to counteract the hazards . ''
`` Particularly flagrant , '' Mrs. Dole said , `` are the company 's numerous failures to properly record injuries at its Fairless works , in spite of the firm promise it had made in an earlier corporate - wide settlement agreement to correct such discrepancies . ''
That settlement was in April 1987 .
A USX spokesman said the company had n't yet received any documents from OSHA regarding the penalty or fine .
`` Once we do , they will receive very serious evaluation , '' the spokesman said .
`` No consideration is more important than the health and safety of our employees . ''
USX said it has been cooperating with OSHA since the agency began investigating the Clairton and Fairless works .
He said that , if and when safety problems were identified , they were corrected .
The USX citations represented the first sizable enforcement action taken by OSHA under Mr. Scannell .
He has promised stiffer fines , though the size of penalties sought by OSHA have been rising in recent years even before he took office this year .
`` The big problem is that USX management has proved unwilling to devote the necessary resources and manpower to removing hazards and to safeguarding safety and health in the plants , '' said Linda Anku , OSHA regional administrator in Philadelphia .
USX has 15 working days to contest the citations and proposed penalties , before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission .
Before the USX case , OSHA 's largest proposed fine for one employer was $ 4.3 million for alleged safety violations at John Morrell & Co. , a meatpacking subsidiary of United Brands Co. , Cincinnati .
The company is contesting the fine .
A man from the Bush administration came before the House Agriculture Committee yesterday to talk about the U.S. 's intention to send some $ 100 million in food aid to Poland , with more to come from the EC .
The committee 's members are worried what all this free food might do to the economic prospects of Poland 's own farmers .
Rep. Gary Ackerman noted that past food aid had harmed farmers in El Salvador and Egypt .
However well intentioned , food transfers have the habit of growing larger and wrecking the market incentives for the recipient country 's own farmers .
The First World has for some time had the bad habit of smothering other people 's economies with this kind of unfocused kindness .
It should be constantly stressed that Poland 's farmers mostly need a real market for their products .
Metallgesellschaft AG said it agreed to acquire 51 % of Lentjes AG from the Ferdinand Lentjes Foundation .
Terms were n't disclosed .
Metallgesellschaft , a diversified Frankfurt , West Germany - based metals group , said it is buying the stake in the specialized engineering company to expand its production of environmental supplies for power plants .
Lentjes ' product mix of specialized boilers and pipes provides a good fit with its own Lurgi G.m.b . H. plant engineering unit , the company said .
The move is part of a strategy to focus on its core metals trading , processing and plant engineering activities while shedding peripheral units , the company said .
Lentjes had 1988 sales of 800 million marks -LRB- $ 434.4 million -RRB- and has a current order backlog of 2.5 billion marks .
The sale comes in place of a planned initial public offering of Lentjes stock .
A plan to bring the stock to market before year end apparently was upset by the recent weakness of Frankfurt share prices .
Wall Street 's big securities firms face the prospect of having their credit ratings lowered .
The reason : Risks from the firms ' new `` merchant banking '' activities are rising as revenue from the industry 's traditional business erodes .
The downgrading of debt issued by CS First Boston Inc. , parent of First Boston Corp. , by Moody 's Investors Service Inc. , coupled with a Moody 's announcement that Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. is under review for a possible downgrade , sent shivers through the brokerage community this week .
With the shudders came the realization that some of Wall Street 's biggest players are struggling to maintain the stellar credit standing required to finance their activities profitably .
Securities firms are among the biggest issuers of commercial paper , or short - term corporate IOUs , which they sell to finance their daily operations .
The biggest firms still retain the highest ratings on their commercial paper .
But Moody 's warned that Shearson 's commercial paper rating could be lowered soon , a move that would reduce Shearson 's profit margins on its borrowings and signal trouble ahead for other firms .
Shearson is 62 % - owned by American Express Co .
`` Just as the 1980s bull market transformed the U.S. securities business , so too will the more difficult environment of the 1990s , '' says Christopher T. Mahoney , a Moody 's vice president .
`` A sweeping restructuring of the industry is possible . ''
Standard & Poor 's Corp. says First Boston , Shearson and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , in particular , are likely to have difficulty shoring up their credit standing in months ahead .
What worries credit - rating concerns the most is that Wall Street firms are taking long - term risks with their own capital via leveraged buy - out and junk bond financings .
That 's a departure from their traditional practice of transferring almost all financing risks to investors .
Whereas conventional securities financings are structured to be sold quickly , Wall Street 's new penchant for leveraged buy - outs and junk bonds is resulting in long - term lending commitments that stretch out for months or years .
`` The recent disarray in the junk bond market suggests that brokers may become longer - term creditors than they anticipated and may face long delays '' in getting their money back , says Jeffrey Bowman , a vice president at S&P , which raised a warning flag for the industry in April when it downgraded CS First Boston .
`` Wall Street is facing a Catch - 22 situation , '' says Mr. Mahoney of Moody 's .
Merchant banking , where firms commit their own money , `` is getting riskier , and there 's less of it to go around . ''
In addition , he says , the buy - out business is under pressure `` because of the junk bond collapse , '' meaning that returns are likely to decline as the volume of junk - bond financings shrinks .
In a leveraged buy - out , a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing , with the expectation that the debt will be paid with funds generated by the acquired company 's operations or sales of its assets .
In a recent report , Moody 's said it `` expects intense competition to occur through the rest of the century in the securities industry , which , combined with overcapacity , will create poor prospects for profitability . ''
It said that the `` temptation for managements to ease this profit pressure by taking greater risks is an additional rating factor . ''
Both Moody 's and S&P cited First Boston 's reliance in recent years on merchant banking , which has been responsible for a significant portion of the closely held firm 's profit .
The recent cash squeeze at Campeau Corp. , First Boston 's most lucrative client of the decade , is proving costly to First Boston because it arranged more than $ 3 billion of high - yield , high - risk junk financings for Campeau units .
In addition , a big loan that First Boston made to Ohio Mattress Co . was n't repaid on time when its $ 450 million junk financing for a buy - out of the bedding company was withdrawn .
`` These two exposures alone represent a very substantial portion of CS First Boston 's equity , '' Moody 's said .
`` Total merchant banking exposures are in excess of the firm 's equity . ''
CS First Boston , however , benefits from the backing of its largest shareholder , Credit Suisse , Switzerland 's third largest bank .
Shearson also has been an aggressive participant in the leveraged buy - out business .
But its earnings became a major disappointment as its traditional retail , or individual investor , business showed no signs of rebounding from the slump that followed the October 1987 stock market crash .
In addition , Shearson 's listed $ 2 billion of capital is overstated , according to the rating concerns , because it includes $ 1.7 billion of goodwill .
Shearson `` really only has $ 300 million of capital , '' says Mr. Bowman of S&P .
A Shearson spokesman said the firm is n't worried .
`` A year ago , Moody 's also had Shearson under review for possible downgrade , '' he said .
`` After two months of talks , our rating was maintained . ''
Drexel , meanwhile , already competes at a disadvantage to its big Wall Street rivals because it has a slightly lower commercial paper rating .
The collapse of junk bond prices and the cancellation of many junk bond financings apparently have taken their toll on closely held Drexel , the leading underwriter in that market .
The firm also has been hit with big financial settlements with the government stemming from its guilty plea to six felonies related to a big insider - trading scandal .
Drexel this year eliminated its retail or individual customer business , cutting the firm 's workforce almost in half to just over 5,000 .
Recently , Drexel circulated a private financial statement among several securities firms showing that its earnings performance has diminished this year from previous years .
The firm 's capital , moreover , has n't grown at the same rate as in the past , officials at these firms say .
Drexel remains confident of its future creditworthiness .
`` We 're well positioned with $ 1.7 billion of capital , '' a Drexel spokesman said .
`` And as a leading investment and merchant banking firm , the fact that we are no longer subject to the uncertainties and vicissitudes of the retail business is a major plus in our view .
Moreover , we 've probably been the most aggressive firm on the Street in reducing costs , which are down around 40 % over the last six months .
Nissan Motor Co. , Japan 's second - largest car maker , announced Wednesday that the parent concern 's pretax earnings in the first half ended last Sept. 30 rose 14 % to 88.32 billion yen -LRB- $ 618.1 million -RRB- from 77.6 billion yen a year earlier .
Nissan cited strong domestic sales against the backdrop of continuous economic expansion .
Profit surged 42 % to 40.21 billion yen , or 16.09 yen a share , from 28.36 billion yen , or 11.72 yen a share .
Sales totaled 1.916 trillion yen , climbing 17 % from 1.637 trillion yen in the year - earlier period .
Nissan scheduled a seven - yen interim dividend payment , unchanged .
Atsushi Muramatsu , executive vice president and chief financial officer of Nissan , said , `` The company has experienced a remarkable turnaround in terms of profitability since the fiscal year ending March 1987 , when the sharp and rapid appreciation of the yen caused many difficulties .
`` It can be said that the trend of financial improvement has been firmly set , '' he added .
Odyssey Partners Limited Partnership , an investment firm , completed the purchase of May Department Stores Co. 's Caldor discount chain for $ 500 million plus the assumption of $ 52 million in debt .
Caldor , based in Norwalk , Conn. , operates 118 stores in the Northeast ; it reported revenue of $ 1.6 billion last year .
May Stores , St. Louis , runs such well - known department stores as Lord & Taylor .
Leon J. Level , vice president and chief financial officer of this computer services concern , and F. Warren McFarlan , a professor at Harvard University 's Graduate School of Business , were elected directors , increasing board membership to nine .
The United Kingdom High Court declared illegal a variety of interest - rate swap transactions and options deals between a London borough council and commercial banks .
The ruling could lead to the cancellation of huge bank debts the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham ran up after losing heavily on swap transactions .
As many as 70 U.K. and international banks stand to lose several hundred million pounds should the decision be upheld and set a precedent for other municipalities .
An appeal is expected .
In response to the ruling , gilt futures swiftly plunged more than a point yesterday before recovering much of the loss by the end of the session .
Gilts , or British government bonds , which also fell sharply initially , retraced some of the losses to end about 3/8 point lower .
The council , which is alleged to have engaged in over 600 deals valued at over # 6 billion -LRB- $ 9.5 billion -RRB- , lost millions of pounds from soured swap deals .
At one point , Hammersmith is reported to have accounted for as much as 10 % of the sterling market in interest - rate swap dealings .
When two parties engage in an interest - rate swap , they are betting against each other on future rates .
Thus , an institution obligated to make fixed - rate interest payments on debt swaps the payments with another making floating - rate payments .
In most of the British transactions , the municipalities agreed to make floating - rate payments to banks , which would make fixed - rate payments .
As interest rates rose , municipalities owed the banks more than the banks were paying them .
The court hearing began in early October at the request of Anthony Hazell , district auditor for Hammersmith , who argued that local councils are n't vested with constitutional authority to engage in such capital - markets activities .
The council backed the audit commission 's stand that the swap transactions are illegal .
Although the Hammersmith and Fulham council was by far the most active local authority engaging in such capital - markets transactions , the court decision could set a precedent for similar transactions by 77 other local councils .
`` While this court ruling was only on Hammersmith , it will obviously be very persuasive in other cases of a similar nature , '' a solicitor representing one of the banks said .
Already , 10 local councils have refused to honor fees and payments to banks incurred during various swaps dealings .
Other financial institutions involved include Barclays Bank PLC , Midland Bank PLC , Security Pacific Corp. , Chemical Banking Corp. 's Chemical Bank , Citicorp 's Citibank and Mitsubishi Finance International .
If the banks exhaust all avenues of appeal , it is possible that they would seek to have the illegality ruling work both ways , some market sources said .
Banks could seek to recover payments to local authorities in instances where the banks made net payments to councils .
Officials from the various banks involved are expected to meet during the next few days to consider other arrangements with local authorities that could be questionable .
The banks have 28 days to file an appeal against the ruling and are expected to do so shortly .
FALL BALLOT ISSUES set a record for off - year elections .
Odd - year elections attract relatively few ballot issues .
But the 1989 fall total of 80 , while well below 1988 activity , shows `` a steady ratcheting up in citizen referenda and initiatives , '' says Patrick McGuigan , editor of Family , Law and Democracy Report .
He says the 10 citizen - sparked issues on state ballots this fall represent the most in any odd - year this decade .
Ballot questions range from a Maine initiative on banning Cruise missiles to a referendum on increasing the North Dakota income tax .
Ballot watchers say attention already is focused on the 1990 elections .
In California , two petition drives for next year 's election are `` essentially finished , '' says David Schmidt , author of `` Citizen Lawmakers . ''
Mr. McGuigan cites three completed efforts in Oklahoma .
Hot ballot topics are expected to be abortion , the environment and insurance reform .
Taking a cue from California , more politicians will launch their campaigns by backing initiatives , says David Magleby of Brigham Young University .
PHOTOGRAPH COLLECTING gains new stature as prices rise .
Price records are being set at auctions this week .
At Christie 's , a folio of 21 prints from Alfred Stieglitz 's `` Equivalents '' series sold for $ 396,000 , a single - lot record .
Other works also have been exceeding price estimates .
In part , prices reflect development of a market structure based on such variables as the number of prints .
This information used to be poorly documented and largely anecdotal , says Beth Gates - Warren of Sotheby 's .
`` There is finally some sort of sense in the market , '' she says .
Corporations and museums are among the serious buyers , giving greater market stability , says Robert Persky of the Photograph Collector .
`` When I see prints going into the hands of institutions , I know they are n't going to come back on the market . ''
Most in demand : classic photographs by masters such as Stieglitz and Man Ray .
But much contemporary work is also fetching `` a great deal of money , '' says Miles Barth of the International Center of Photography .
DIALING 900 brings callers a growing number of services .
Currently a $ 300 million - a - year business , 900 telephone service is expected to hit $ 500 million next year and near $ 2 billion by 1992 as uses for the service continue to expand , says Joel Gross of Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Inc .
The service -- which costs the caller from 30 cents to $ 25 a minute -- currently is dominated by celebrity chatter , horoscopes and romance lines .
But more serious applications are in the wings , and that is where the future growth is expected .
`` I 'm starting to see more business transactions , '' says Andrea West of American Telephone & Telegraph Co. , noting growing interest in use of 900 service for stock sales , software tutorials and even service contracts .
Colleges , she says , are eyeing registration through 900 service .
Charities test the waters , but they face legal barriers to electronic fund raising .
`` The thing that will really break this market right open is merchandising , '' Ms. West says .
Much of the 800 service will `` migrate to 900 , '' predicts Jack Lawless , general manager of US Sprint 's 900 product .

DIAPER SERVICES make a comeback amid growing environmental concerns .
Concerned about shrinking landfills and the safety of chemicals used in super-absorbent disposables , parents are returning to the cloth diaper .
Tiny Tots Inc. , Campbell , Calif. , says business is up 35 % in the past year .
`` We 're gaining 1,200 new customers each week , '' says Jack Mogavero of General Health Care Corp. , Piscataway , N.J .
In Syracuse , N.Y. , DyDee Service 's new marketing push stresses environmental awareness .
Among its new customers : day - care centers that previously spurned the service .
The National Association of Diaper Services , Philadelphia , says that since January it has gotten more than 672 inquiries from people interested in starting diaper services .
Elisa Hollis launched a diaper service last year because State College , Pa. , where she lives , did n't have one .
Diaper shortages this summer limited growth at Stork Diaper Services , Springfield , Mass. , where business is up 25 % in
Also spurring the move to cloth : diaper covers with Velcro fasteners that eliminate the need for safety pins .

Despite a deluge of economic news , the Treasury market remained quiet but the corporate market was abuzz over International Business Machines Corp. 's huge debt offering .
`` There were so many economic reports but the market did n't care about any of them , '' said Kathleen Camilli , a money market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc .
`` So the focus turned to other fixed - income markets , corporate and mortgages in particular , '' she said .
IBM , the giant computer maker , offered $ 750 million of non-callable 30 - year debentures priced to yield 8.47 % , or about 1/2 percentage point higher than the yield on 30 - year Treasury bonds .
The size of IBM 's issue was increased from an originally planned $ 500 million as money managers and investors scrambled to buy the bonds .
In the investment - grade corporate market , `` it 's rare that you get an opportunity to buy a name that has such broad appeal and has such attractive call features , '' said James Ednie , a Drexel industrial bond trader .
Money managers ranked IBM 's offering as the most significant investment - grade sale of the year because large issues of long - term debt by companies with triple - A credit are infrequent .
Syndicate officials at lead underwriter Salomon Brothers Inc. said the debentures were snapped by up pension funds , banks , insurance companies and other institutional investors .
In the Treasury market , investors paid scant attention to the day 's economic reports , which for the most part provided a mixed view of the economy .
`` Whether you thought the economy was growing weak or holding steady , yesterday 's economic indicators did n't change your opinion , '' said Charles Lieberman , a managing director at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp .
The government reported that orders for manufactured goods were essentially unchanged in September while construction spending was slightly lower .
Both indicators were viewed as signs that the nation 's industrial sector is growing very slowly , if at all .
A survey by the Federal Reserve 's 12 district banks and the latest report by the National Association of Purchasing Management blurred that picture of the economy .
In a monthly report prepared for use at the Fed 's next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Nov. 14. , the nation 's central bank found that price increases have moderated and economic activity has grown at a sluggish pace in recent weeks .
Among other things , the survey found that manufacturing activity varied considerably across districts and among industries .
The Philadelphia and Cleveland districts , for example , reported declines in manufacturing activity while the Boston , Dallas and San Francisco banks noted that business expanded .
The purchasing managers index of economic activity rose in October , although it remains below 50 % .
A reading below 50 % indicates that the manufacturing sector is slowing while a reading above 50 % suggests that the industry is expanding .
Mr. Lieberman said the diverse showing in yesterday 's reports `` only enhances the importance of the employment data . ''
The employment report , which at times has caused wide swings in bond prices , is due out tomorrow .
The average estimate of 22 economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report was that non-farm payrolls expanded by 152,000 in October .
The economists forecast a 0.1 % rise in the unemployment rate to 5.4 % .
Treasury Securities
In a surprise announcement , the Treasury said it will reopen the outstanding benchmark 30 - year bond rather than create a new one for next week 's quarterly refunding of the federal debt .
The Treasury will raise $ 10 billion in fresh cash by selling $ 30 billion of securities , including $ 10 billion of new three - year notes and $ 10 billion of new 10 - year notes .
But rather than sell new 30 - year bonds , the Treasury will issue $ 10 billion of 29year , nine - month bonds -- essentially increasing the size of the current benchmark 30 - year bond that was sold at the previous refunding in August .
Credit market analysts said the decision to reopen the current benchmark , the 8 1/8 % bond due August 2019 , is unusual because the issue trades at a premium to its face amount .
Some dealers said the Treasury 's intent is to help government bond dealers gauge investor demand for the securities , given uncertainties about when the auction will occur .
The Treasury said the refunding is contingent upon congressional and presidential passage of an increase in the federal debt ceiling .
Until such action takes places , the Treasury has no ability to issue new debt of any kind .
Meanwhile , Treasury bonds ended modestly higher in quiet trading .
The benchmark 30 - year bond about 1/4 point , or $ 2.50 for each $ 1,000 face amount .
The benchmark was priced at 102 22/32 to yield 7.88 % compared with 102 12/32 to yield 7.90 % Tuesday .
The latest 10 - year notes were quoted at 100 22/32 to yield 7.88 % compared with 100 16/32 to yield 7.90 % .
The discount rate on three - month Treasury bills was essentially unchanged at 7.79 % , while the rate on six - month bills was slightly lower at 7.52 % compared with 7.60 % Tuesday .
Corporate Issues
IBM 's $ 750 million debenture offering dominated activity in the corporate debt market .
Meanwhile , most investment - grade bonds ended unchanged to as much as 1/8 point higher .
In its latest compilation of performance statistics , Moody 's Investors Service found that investment - grade bonds posted a total return of 2.7 % in October while junk bonds showed a negative return of 1.5 % .
Moody 's said those returns compare with a 3.8 % total return for longer - term Treasury notes and bonds .
Total return measures price changes and interest income .
For the year to date , Moody 's said total returns were topped by the 16.5 % of longer - term Treasury issues , closely followed by 15 % for investment - grade bonds .
Junk bonds trailed the group again .
`` Even the 7.2 % return from the risk - free three - month Treasury bill has easily outdistanced the 4.1 % return from junk bonds , '' wrote Moody 's economist John Lonski in yesterday 's market report .
`` Little wonder that buyers for junk have been found wanting , '' he said .
Moody 's said the average net asset value of 24 junk - bond mutual funds fell by 4.2 % in October .
Mortgage - Backed Issues
Mortgage securities ended slightly higher but trailed gains in the Treasury market .
Ginnie Mae 's 9 % issue for November delivery finished at 98 5/8 , up 2/32 , and its 9 1/2 % issue at 100 22/32 , also up 2/32 .
The Ginnie Mae 9 % securities were yielding 9.32 % to a 12 - year average life .
Activity was light in derivative markets , with no new issues priced .
Municipal Issues
Municipal bonds were mostly unchanged to up 1/8 point in light , cautious trading prior to tomorrow 's unemployment report .
A $ 114 million issue of health facility revenue bonds from the California Health Facilities Financing Authority was temporarily withdrawn after being tentatively priced by a First Boston Corp. group .
An official for the lead underwriter declined to comment on the reason for the delay , but market participants speculated that a number of factors , including a lack of investor interest , were responsible .
The issue could be relaunched , possibly in a restructured form , as early as next week , according to the lead underwriter .
A $ 107.03 million offering of Santa Ana Community Redevelopment Agency , Calif. , tax allocation bonds got off to a slow start and may be repriced at lower levels today , according to an official with lead underwriter Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp .
The Santa Ana bonds were tentatively priced to yield from 6.40 % in 1991 to 7.458 % in
Bucking the market trend , an issue of $ 130 million general obligation distributable state aid bonds from Detroit , Mich. , apparently drew solid investor interest .
They were tentatively priced to yield from 6.20 % in 1991 to 7.272 % in
Foreign Bond
West German dealers said there was little interest in Treasury bonds ahead of Thursday 's new government bond issue .
So far , they said , investors appear unenthusiastic about the new issue which might force the government to raise the coupon to more than 7 % .
It is generally expected to be the usual 10 - year , four billion mark issue .
Rumors to the contrary have been that it would be a six billion mark issue , or that the last Bund , a 7 % issue due October 1999 , would be increased by two billion marks .
Elsewhere :
-- In Japan , the benchmark No. 111 4.6 % issue due 1998 ended on brokers screens unchanged at 95.09 to yield 5.435 % .
-- In Britain , the benchmark 11 3/4 % bond due 2003 / 2007 fell 14/32 to 111 2/32 to yield 10.19 % .
The 12 % notes due 1995 fell 9/32 to 103 3/8 to yield 11.10 % .
Avions Marcel Dassault - Breguet Aviation S.A. said group profit before taxes and contributions to employee profit - sharing soared 97 % to 839 million francs -LRB- $ 129.6 million -RRB- in the first half of 1989 from 425 million francs a year earlier .
The French aircraft group pointed out , however , that financial results from its sector of industry are frequently erratic because of irregular cash flow from large contracts .
It noted , for example , that group revenue for the first half was 8.734 billion francs , down about 12 % from 9.934 billion francs a year earlier .
Still , it said it expects sales for all of 1989 to be on the order of 20 billion francs , reflecting anticipated billings for two large contracts in the second half of the year .
For all of 1988 , Dassault had group profit of 428 million francs on revenue of 18.819 billion francs .
The group has n't yet released earnings figures for the first half of 1989 , nor has it made a detailed forecast of its full - year earnings .
The economy 's temperature will be taken from several vantage points this week , with readings on trade , output , housing and inflation .
The most troublesome report may be the August merchandise trade deficit due out tomorrow .
The trade gap is expected to widen to about $ 9 billion from July 's $ 7.6 billion , according to a survey by MMS International , a unit of McGraw - Hill Inc. , New York .
Thursday 's report on the September consumer price index is expected to rise , although not as sharply as the 0.9 % gain reported Friday in the producer price index .
That gain was being cited as a reason the stock market was down early in Friday 's session , before it got started on its reckless 190 - point plunge .
Economists are divided as to how much manufacturing strength they expect to see in September reports on industrial production and capacity utilization , also due tomorrow .
Meanwhile , September housing starts , due Wednesday , are thought to have inched upward .
`` There 's a possibility of a surprise '' in the trade report , said Michael Englund , director of research at MMS .
A widening of the deficit , if it were combined with a stubbornly strong dollar , would exacerbate trade problems -- but the dollar weakened Friday as stocks plummeted .
In any event , Mr. Englund and many others say that the easy gains in narrowing the trade gap have already been made .
`` Trade is definitely going to be more politically sensitive over the next six or seven months as improvement begins to slow , '' he said .
Exports are thought to have risen strongly in August , but probably not enough to offset the jump in imports , economists said .
Views on manufacturing strength are split between economists who read September 's low level of factory job growth as a sign of a slowdown and those who use the somewhat more comforting total employment figures in their calculations .
The wide range of estimates for the industrial output number underscores the differences : The forecasts run from a drop of 0.5 % to an increase of 0.4 % , according to MMS .
A rebound in energy prices , which helped push up the producer price index , is expected to do the same in the consumer price report .
The consensus view expects a 0.4 % increase in the September CPI after a flat reading in August .
Robert H. Chandross , an economist for Lloyd 's Bank in New York , is among those expecting a more moderate gain in the CPI than in prices at the producer level .
`` Auto prices had a big effect in the PPI , and at the CPI level they wo n't , '' he said .
Food prices are expected to be unchanged , but energy costs jumped as much as 4 % , said Gary Ciminero , economist at Fleet / Norstar Financial Group .
He also says he thinks `` core inflation , '' which excludes the volatile food and energy prices , was strong last month .
He expects a gain of as much as 0.5 % in core inflation after a summer of far smaller increases .
Housing starts are expected to quicken a bit from August 's annual pace of 1,350,000 units .
Economists say an August rebound in permits for multifamily units signaled an increase in September starts , though activity remains fairly modest by historical standards .
The Bush administration , urging the Supreme Court to give states more leeway to restrict abortions , said minors have n't any right to abortion without the consent of their parents .
Solicitor General Kenneth Starr argued that the 1973 Supreme Court decision , Roe vs. Wade , recognizing a constitutional right to abortion , was incorrect .
He also argued that the high court was wrong in 1976 to rule that minors have a right to abortion that ca n't be absolutely vetoed by their parents .
The administration 's position was outlined in a friend - of - the - court brief filed in one of three abortion cases the Supreme Court will hear argued and will decide this term .
The administration filed the brief in an appeal involving a Minnesota law that requires that both parents of a minor be notified before she may have an abortion .
The administration urged the justices to adopt a legal standard suggested by Chief Justice William Rehnquist last July when the high court upheld Missouri 's abortion restrictions .
Under that standard , which garnered the votes of only three of the nine justices , a state restriction of abortion is constitutional if the state has a `` reasonable '' justification for adopting it .
That is a much easier standard for a state to satisfy than the Supreme Court 's test since 1973 , which requires a state to have a `` compelling '' reason for restricting abortion .
On the provisions of the Minnesota law , the Bush administration said that requiring that both parents be notified is a reasonable regulation , and that there is no need to have an alternative that allows minors to go to court for a judge 's permission instead .
The case , Hodgson vs. Minnesota , will be argued Nov. 29 .
The Canadian government announced a new , 12 - year Canada Savings Bond issue that will yield investors 10.5 % in the first year .
The annual interest rate for each of the next 11 years will be set each fall , when details of a new series are released .
Canada Savings Bonds are major government instruments for meeting its financial requirements .
The government has about 41.4 billion Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ 35.2 billion -RRB- of such bonds currently outstanding .
Only Canadian residents are permitted to buy Canada Savings Bonds , which may be redeemed any time at face value .
The bonds go on sale Oct. 19 .
Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co. , a unit of Lockheed Corp. , said it agreed to join with Aermacchi S.p . A. of Varese , Italy , to propose a new generation of jet trainers for the U.S. Air Force .
The Air Force is looking to buy 540 new primary jet trainers , with a total value of $ 1.5 billion to $ 2 billion , between 1994 and 2004 .
The aircraft would replace the T - 37 , made by the Cessna Aircraft Co. unit of General Dynamics Corp. , which the Air Force uses to train jet pilots .
Lockheed said the U.S. Navy may also buy an additional 340 trainer aircraft to replace its T34C trainers made by the Beech Aircraft Corp. unit of Raytheon Corp .
Under the agreement with Lockheed , Aermacchi will license Lockheed to build the Aermacchi MB - 339 jet tandem - trainer and will supply certain structures .
Lockheed will build additional structures and perform final assembly of the tandem - seat trainer at its Marietta , Ga. , plant should the Air Force order the craft .
A Lockheed spokesman in Burbank , Calif. , said he was n't aware of which other companies would be competing for the Air Force contract .
Of all the one - time expenses incurred by a corporation or professional firm , few are larger or longer term than the purchase of real estate or the signing of a commercial lease .
To take full advantage of the financial opportunities in this commitment , however , the corporation or professional firm must do more than negotiate the best purchase price or lease terms .
It must also evaluate the real - estate market in the chosen location from a new perspective .
Specifically , it must understand how real - estate markets overreact to shifts in regional economies and then take advantage of these opportunities .
When a regional economy catches cold , the local real - estate market gets pneumonia .
In other words , real - estate market indicators , such as building permits and leasing activity , plummet much further than a local economy in recession .
This was seen in the late 1960s in Los Angeles and the mid-1970s in New York .
But the reverse is also true : When a region 's economy rebounds from a slowdown , these real - estate indicators will rebound far faster than the improving economy .
Why do local real - estate markets overreact to regional economic cycles ?
Because real - estate purchases and leases are such major long - term commitments that most companies and individuals make these decisions only when confident of future economic stability and growth .
Metropolitan Detroit was written off economically during the early 1980s , as the domestic auto industry suffered a serious sales depression and adjustment .
Area employment dropped by 13 % from its 1979 peak and retail sales were down 14 % .
However , the real - estate market was hurt even more .
For example , residential building permits in the trough year of 1982 were off 76 % from the 1979 peak level .
Once metropolitan Detroit 's economy rallied in the mid-1980s , real estate rebounded .
Building permits , for example , soared a staggering 400 % between 1982 and the peak year of 1986 .
Where , savvy corporations and professional firms are now asking , are today 's opportunities ?
Look no further than metropolitan Houston and Denver , two of the most depressed , overbuilt and potentially undervalued real - estate markets in the nation .
Of course , some observers have touted Houston and Denver for the past five years as a counter-cyclical play .
But now appears to be the time to act .
Metropolitan Houston 's economy did drop and then flatten in the years after its 1982 peak .
In the mid-1980s , employment was down as much as 5 % from the 1982 peak and retail sales were off 13 % .
The real - estate market suffered even more severe setbacks .
Office construction dropped 97 % .
The vacancy rate soared more than 20 % in nearly every product category , and more than 30 % of office space was vacant .
To some observers , the empty office buildings of Houston 's `` see - through skyline '' were indicative of a very troubled economy .
As usual , the real - estate market had overreacted .
Actually , the region 's economy retained a firm foundation .
Metropolitan Houston 's population has held steady over the past six years .
And personal income , after slumping in the mid-1980s , has returned to its 1982 level in real dollar terms .
Today , metropolitan Houston 's real - estate market is poised for a significant turnaround .
More than 42,000 jobs were added in metro Houston last year , primarily in biotechnology , petrochemical processing , and the computer industry .
This growth puts Houston in the top five metro areas in the nation last year .
And forecasts project a 2.5 % to 3 % growth rate in jobs over the next few years -- nearly twice the national average .
Denver is another metropolitan area where the commercial real - estate market has overreacted to the region 's economic trends , although Denver has not experienced as severe an economic downturn as Houston .
By some measures , metropolitan Denver 's economy has actually improved in the past four years .
Its population has continued to increase since 1983 , the peak year of the economic cycle .
Employment is now 4 % higher than in 1983 .
Buying income in real dollars actually increased 15 % between 1983 and 1987 -LRB- the most recent year available -RRB- .
The rates of increase , however , are less than the rapid growth of the boom years , and this has resulted in a loss of confidence in the economy .
In a self - fulfilling prophecy , therefore , the region 's real - estate market all but collapsed in recent years .
Housing building permits are down more than 75 % from their 1983 peaks .
Although no one can predict when metropolitan Denver 's real - estate market will rebound , major public works projects costing several billion dollars are under way or planned -- such as a new convention center , a major beltway encircling the metropolitan area , and a new regional airport .
When Denver 's regional economy begins to grow faster -- such a recovery could occur as early as next year -- business and consumer confidence will return , and the resulting explosion of real - estate activity will dwarf the general economic rebound .
What real - estate strategy should one follow in a metropolitan area whose economic health is not as easy to determine as Houston 's or Denver 's ?
Generally , overcapacity in commercial real estate is dropping from its mid-1980s peak , even in such economically healthy metropolitan areas as Washington , New York and Los Angeles .
Vacancy rates in the 15 % to 19 % range today may easily rise to the low to mid-20 % range in a couple of years .
Under these conditions , even a flattening out of economic growth -- `` catching cold '' -- in the healthy metropolitan areas will create significant opportunities for corporations and professional service firms looking for bargains as the realestate industry catches pneumonia .
Those looking for real - estate bargains in distressed metropolitan areas should lock in leases or buy now ; those looking in healthy metropolitan areas should take a short - term -LRB- three - year -RRB- lease and wait for the bargains ahead .

Fidelity has increased its stake in Hammond to 23.57 % in recent months .
Statements made in Securities and Exchange Commission filings led Hammond to request a standstill agreement .

Lomas Financial Corp. , Dallas , said it will ask a U.S. bankruptcy court to allow it to hire Lazard Freres & Co. to help it sell its leasing unit .
Lomas , assisted by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets , has been trying to sell its Equitable Lomas Leasing Co. for several months , apparently without success .
The real estate and mortgage banking concern had hoped to use proceeds from the sale to reduce its debt .
Without cash from asset sales and unable to reach a new bank - credit agreement , Lomas defaulted on $ 145 million in notes that became due Sept. 1 .
It filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code Sept. 24 to give it additional time to work on a plan to restructure its $ 1.45 billion in senior debt .
Lomas said Merrill Lynch , which owns bonds and equity in Lomas , could n't continue as Lomas 's investment banker because it is also a creditor .
It said it chose Lazard in part because of Lazard 's offices in Europe and Japan , where investors might be interested in a U.S. leasing company .

Stocks : Volume 251,170,000 shares .

Friday 's 190 - point plunge in stocks does not come atop the climate of anxiety that dominated financial markets just prior to their 1987 October crash , and mechanisms have been put in place to keep markets more orderly .
Still , the lesson is about the same : On Friday the 13th , the market was spooked by Washington .
The consensus along the street seems to be that the plunge was triggered by the financing problems of the UAL takeover , and it 's certainly true the rout began immediately after the UAL trading halt .
Still , the consensus seems almost as wide that one faltering bid is no reason to write down the value of all U.S. business .
This observation leads us to another piece of news moving on the Dow Jones ticker shortly before the downturn : the success of Senate Democrats in stalling the capital gains tax cut .
The real value of all shares , after all , is directly impacted by the tax on any profits -LRB- all the more so given the limits on deductions for losses that show gains are not `` ordinary income '' -RRB- .
And market expectations clearly have been raised by the capital gains victory in the House last month .
An hour before Friday 's plunge , that provision was stripped from the tax bill , leaving it with $ 5.4 billion in tax increases without a capital gains cut .
There is a great deal to be said , to be sure , for stripping the garbage out of the reconciliation bill .
It would be a good thing if Congress started to decide issues one - by - one on their individual merits without trickery .
For one thing , no one doubts that the capital gains cut would pass on an up - or - down vote .
Since Senate leaders have so far fogged it up with procedural smokescreens , promises of a cleaner bill are suspect .
Especially so since President Bush has been weakened by the Panama fiasco .
To the extent that the UAL troubles contributed to the plunge , they are another instance of Washington 's sticky fingers .
As the best opportunities for corporate restructurings are exhausted of course , at some point the market will start to reject them .
But the airlines are scarcely a clear case , given anti-takeover mischief by Secretary of Transportation Skinner , who professes to believe safety will be compromised if KLM and British Airways own interests in companies that fly airplanes .
Worse , Congress has started to jump on the Skinner bandwagon .
James Oberstar , the Minnesota Democrat who chairs the Public Works and Transportation Committee 's aviation subcommittee , has put an anti-airline takeover bill on supersonic speed so that it would be passed in time to affect the American and United Air Lines bids .
It would give Mr. Skinner up to 50 days to `` review '' any bid for 15 % or more of the voting stock of any U.S. carrier with revenues of $ 1 billion or more .
So the UAL deal has problems , and the market loses 190 points .
Congratulations , Mr. Secretary and Mr. Congressman .
In the 1987 crash , remember , the market was shaken by a Danny Rostenkowski proposal to tax takeovers out of existance .
Even more important , in our view , was the Treasury 's threat to thrash the dollar .
The Treasury is doing the same thing today ; thankfully , the dollar is not under 1987 - style pressure .
Also , traders are in better shape today than in 1987 to survive selling binges .
They are better capitalized .
They are in less danger of losing liquidity simply because of tape lags and clearing and settlement delays .
The Fed promises any needed liquidity .
The Big Board 's liaison with the Chicago Board of Trade has improved ; it will be interesting to learn if `` circuit breakers '' prove to be a good idea .
In any event , some traders see stocks as underpriced today , unlike 1987 .
There is nothing wrong with the market that ca n't be cured by a little coherence and common sense in Washington .
But on the bearish side , that may be too much to expect .
Assuming the stock market does n't crash again and completely discredit yuppies and trading rooms , American television audiences in a few months may be seeing Britain 's concept of both .
`` Capital City '' is a weekly series that premiered here three weeks ago amid unprecedented hype by its producer , Thames Television .
The early episodes make you long for a rerun of the crash of 1987 .
Let 's make that 1929 , just to be sure .
According to the program 's publicity prospectus , `` Capital City , '' set at Shane Longman , a fictional mid-sized securities firm with # 500 million capital , `` follows the fortunes of a close - knit team of young , high - flying dealers , hired for their particular blend of style , genius and energy .
But with all the money and glamour of high finance come the relentless pressures to do well ; pressure to pull off another million before lunch ; pressure to anticipate the market by a fraction of a second ... ''
You need n't be a high - powered securities lawyer to realize the prospectus is guilty of less than full disclosure .
The slickly produced series has been criticized by London 's financial cognoscenti as inaccurate in detail , but its major weakness is its unrealistic depiction of the characters ' professional and private lives .
Turned loose in Shane Longman 's trading room , the yuppie dealers do little right .
Judging by the money lost and mistakes made in the early episodes , Shane Longman 's capital should be just about exhausted by the final 13th week .
In the opening episode we learn that Michelle , a junior bond trader , has indeed pulled off another million before lunch .
Trouble is , she has lost it just as quickly .
Rather than keep the loss a secret from the outside world , Michelle blabs about it to a sandwich man while ordering lunch over the phone .
Little chance that Shane Longman is going to recoup today .
Traders spend the morning frantically selling bonds , in the belief that the U.S. monthly trade figures will look lousy .
Ah , perfidious Columbia !
The trade figures turn out well , and all those recently unloaded bonds spurt in price .
So much for anticipating the market by a fraction of a second .
And a large slice of the first episode is devoted to efforts to get rid of some nearly worthless Japanese bonds -LRB- since when is anything Japanese nearly worthless nowadays ? -RRB- .
Surprisingly , Shane Longman survives the week , only to have a senior executive innocently bumble his way into becoming the target of a criminal insider trading investigation .
Instead of closing ranks to protect the firm 's reputation , the executive 's internal rivals , led by a loutish American , demand his resignation .
The plot is thwarted when the firm 's major stockholder , kelp farming on the other side of the globe , hurries home to support the executive .
But the investigation continues .
If you can swallow the premise that the rewards for such ineptitude are six - figure salaries , you still are left puzzled , because few of the yuppies consume very conspicuously .
In fact , few consume much of anything .
Two share a house almost devoid of furniture .
Michelle lives in a hotel room , and although she drives a canary - colored Porsche , she has n't time to clean or repair it ; the beat - up vehicle can be started only with a huge pair of pliers because the ignition key has broken off in the lock .
And it takes Declan , the obligatory ladies ' man of the cast , until the third episode to get past first base with any of his prey .
Perhaps the explanation for these anomalies is that class - conscious Britain is n't ready to come to terms with the wealth created by the Thatcherian free - enterprise regime .
After all , this is n't old money , but new money , and in many cases , young money .
This attitude is clearly illustrated in the treatment of Max , the trading room 's most flamboyant character .
Yuppily enough , he lives in a lavishly furnished converted church , wears designer clothes and drives an antique car .
But apparently to make him palatable , even lovable , to the masses , the script inflates pony - tailed Max into an eccentric genius , master of 11 Chinese dialects .
He takes his wash to the laundromat , where he meets a punky French girl who dupes him into providing a home for her pet piranha and then promptly steals his car and dumps it in Dieppe .
In producing and promoting `` Capital City , '' Thames has spent about as much as Shane Longman loses on a good day .
The production costs are a not inconsiderable # 8 million -LRB- $ 12.4 million -RRB- , and would have been much higher had not the cost of the trading floor set been absorbed in the budget of `` Dealers , '' an earlier made - for - TV movie .
Another half million quid went for a volley of full - page advertisements in six major British newspapers and for huge posters in the London subway .
These expenses create a special incentive for `` Capital City 's '' producers to flog it , or a Yank - oriented version of it , in America .
Thames 's U.S. marketing agent , Donald Taffner , is preparing to do just that .
He is discreetly hopeful , citing three U.S. comedy series -- `` Three 's Company , '' `` Too Close for Comfort '' and `` Check It Out '' -- that had British antecedents .
Perhaps without realizing it , Mr. Taffner simultaneously has put his finger on the problem and an ideal solution : `` Capital City '' should have been a comedy , a worthy sequel to the screwball British `` Carry On '' movies of the 1960s .
The seeds already are in the script .
The first episode concluded with a marvelously cute scene in which the trading - room crew minded a baby , the casualty of a broken marriage at the firm .
And many in the young cast bear striking resemblances to American TV and movie personalities known for light roles .
Joanna Kanska looks like a young Zsa Zsa Gabor ; William Armstrong , who plays Max , could pass for Hans Conreid , and Douglas Hodge -LRB- Declan -RRB- for James Farentino ; Rolf Saxon is a passable Tommy Noonan and Dorian Healy could easily double for Huntz Hall , the blank - faced foil of the Bowery Boys comedies .
So , OK kids , everybody on stage for `` Carry On Trading '' : The cast is frantically searching the office for misplaced Japanese bonds that suddenly have soared in value because Dai - Ichi Kangyo Bank has just bought the White House .
The pressure is too much for Zsa Zsa , who slaps a security guard .
He backflips into a desktop computer terminal , which explodes , covering Huntz Hall 's face with microchips .
And all the while , the bonds are in the baby 's diaper .
It should run forever .

Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. of Japan and Siemens AG of West Germany announced they have completed a 100 million - mark -LRB- $ 52.2 million -RRB- joint venture to produce electronics parts .
In the venture 's first fiscal year , Siemens will hold 74.9 % of the venture and a Matsushita subsidiary , Matsushita Electronic Components Co. , 25.1 % .
A basic agreement between the two companies was announced in June .
The new company is to be called Siemens Matsushita Components G.m.b . H .
It will have its headquarters in Munich .
Matsushita 's share in the venture will rise to 35 % Oct. 1 , 1990 , and to 50 % the following Oct. 1 .
Siemens will retain majority voting rights .
The parent companies forecast sales for the venture of around 750 million marks for its first fiscal year , Matsushita said .
Sales are expected to rise to one billion marks after four years .
The company will have production facilities in West Germany , Austria , France and Spain .
Giant Group Ltd. said it terminated negotiations for the purchase of Aspen Airways , a Denver - based regional carrier that operates the United Express connector service under contract to UAL Corp. 's United Airlines .
Giant , a Beverly Hills , Calif. , collection of companies that is controlled by Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman , did n't give a reason for halting its plan to acquire the airline , and Aspen officials could n't be reached for comment .
Giant agreed last month to purchase the carrier .
Giant has n't ever disclosed the proposed price , although Avmark Inc. , an Arlington , Va. - based aircraft consulting concern , has valued Aspen 's fleet at about $ 46 million .
The airline would have become the latest in a peculiar blend of Giant companies , which are involved in making cement , recycling newsprint and operating fast - food restaurants .
Government officials here and in other countries laid plans through the weekend to head off a Monday market meltdown -- but went out of their way to keep their moves quiet .
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was on the telephones , making it clear to officials in the U.S. and abroad that the Fed was prepared to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system , as it did in October 1987 , if the action were needed to prevent a financial crisis .
And at the Treasury , Secretary Nicholas Brady talked with friends and associates on Wall Street while Assistant Secretary David Mullins carefully analyzed data on the Friday market plunge .
But the officials feared that any public announcements would only increase market jitters .
In addition , officials at the Fed and in the Bush administration decided that avoiding overt actions and statements over the weekend would give them more strength and flexibility should Friday 's market drop turn into this morning 's rout .
`` The disadvantage at this point is that anything you do that looks like you are doing too much tends to reinforce a sense of crisis , '' said one government official , insisting on anonymity .
The Fed 's efforts at secrecy were partly foiled Sunday morning , when both the New York Times and the Washington Post carried stories quoting a senior Fed official saying the central bank was prepared to pour cash into the banking system Monday morning .
Fed Chairman Greenspan was surprised by both stories , according to knowledgeable sources , and insisted he had n't authorized any public comment .
Nevertheless , Fed officials acknowledged the stories were reasonably accurate portrayals of the central bank 's game plan .
It is prepared to assume the same role it played in October 1987 , providing money to the markets if necessary to keep the financial system afloat .
The Fed provides money to the banking system by buying government securities from financial institutions .
The reticence of federal officials was evident in the appearance Sunday of Budget Director Richard Darman on ABC 's `` This Week . ''
`` Secretary of the Treasury Brady and Chairman Greenspan and the chairman of the SEC and others have been in close contact .
I 'm sure they 'll do what 's right , what 's prudent , what 's sensible , '' he said .
When it was suggested his comment was a `` non-answer , '' Mr. Darman replied : `` It is a non-answer .
But , in this context , that 's the smart thing to do . ''
At the Treasury , Secretary Brady issued a statement minimizing the stock market 's drop .
`` Today 's stock market decline does n't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy , '' he said .
`` The economy remains well - balanced , and the outlook is for continued moderate growth . ''
But administration officials conceded that Friday 's drop carried the chance of further declines this week .
`` One possibility is that this is a surgical setback , reasonably limited in its breadth , and not a major problem , '' said one senior administration official , who also asked that he not be named .
`` The other is that we see another major disaster , like two years ago .
I think that 's less likely . ''
Nevertheless , Fed Chairman Greenspan and Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson were in their offices Sunday evening , monitoring events as they unfolded in markets around the world .
The action was expected to begin with the opening of the New Zealand foreign exchange markets at 5 p.m. EST -- when stocks there plunged -- and to continue as the trading day began later in the evening in Tokyo and through early this morning in Europe .
Both the Treasury and the Fed planned to keep market rooms operating throughout the night to monitor the developments .
In Tokyo , share prices dropped sharply by 1.7 % in early Monday morning trading .
After the initial slide , the market appeared to be turning around but by early afternoon was headed lower .
In the Bush administration , the lead is being taken by Treasury Secretary Brady , Undersecretary Robert Glauber and Assistant Secretary Mullins .
The three men worked together on the so - called Brady Commission , headed by Mr. Brady , which was established after the 1987 crash to examine the market 's collapse .
As a result they have extensive knowledge in financial markets , and financial market crises .
Mr. Brady was at the White House Friday afternoon when the stock market 's decline began .
He was quickly on the phone with Mr. Mullins , who in turn was talking with the chairmen of the New York and Chicago exchanges .
Later , Mr. Brady phoned Mr. Greenspan , SEC Chairman Richard Breeden and numerous contacts in New York and overseas .
Aides say he continued to work the phones through the weekend .
Administration officials say President Bush was briefed throughout Friday afternoon and evening , even after leaving for Camp David .
He had frequent telephone consultations with Mr. Brady and Michael Boskin , chairman of the counsel of economic advisers .
Government officials tried throughout the weekend to render a business - as - usual appearance in order to avoid any sense of panic .
Treasury Undersecretary David Mulford , for instance , was at a meeting of the Business Council in Hot Springs , Va. , when the stock market fell , and remained there through the following day .
And as of last night , Fed Chairman Greenspan had n't canceled his plans to address the American Bankers Association convention in Washington at 10 a.m. this morning .
Ironically , Mr. Greenspan was scheduled to address the same convention in Dallas on Oct. 20 , 1987 .
He flew to Dallas on Oct. 19 , when the market plummeted 508 points , but then turned around the next morning and returned to Washington without delivering his speech .

Mr. Keating is currently the subject of a $ 1.1 billion federal anti-racketeering lawsuit accusing him of bleeding off assets of a California thrift he controlled , Lincoln Savings & Loan Association , and driving it into insolvency .
Fred Wertheimer -- president of Common Cause , the self - styled citizens lobby -- said Mr. Keating already has conceded attempting to buy influence with the lawmakers -- Democratic Sens. Dennis DeConcini of Arizona , Alan Cranston of California , John Glenn of Ohio and Donald Riegle of Michigan ; and GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona .
Mr. Wertheimer based this on a statement by Mr. Keating that was quoted in a Wall Street Journal story in April : `` One question ... had to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause .
I want to say in the most forceful way I can : I certainly hope so . ''
In a highly unusual meeting in Sen. DeConcini 's office in April 1987 , the five senators asked federal regulators to ease up on Lincoln .
According to notes taken by one of the participants at the meeting , the regulators said Lincoln was gambling dangerously with depositors ' federally insured money and was `` a ticking time bomb . ''
Mr. Keating had complained that the regulators were being too zealous .
The notes show that Sen. DeConcini called the Federal Home Loan Bank Board 's regulations `` grossly unfair , '' and that Sen. Glenn insisted that Mr. Keating 's thrift was `` viable and profitable . ''
For the next two years , the Bank Board , which at the time was the agency responsible for regulating thrifts , failed to act -- even after federal auditors warned in May 1987 that Mr. Keating had caused Lincoln to become insolvent .
Lincoln 's parent company , American Continental Corp. , entered bankruptcy - law proceedings this April 13 , and regulators seized the thrift the next day .
The newly formed Resolution Trust Corp. , successor to the Bank Board , filed suit against Mr. Keating and several others on Sept. 15 .
Mr. Keating has filed his own suit , alleging that his property was taken illegally .
The cost to taxpayers of Lincoln 's collapse has been estimated at as much as $ 2.5 billion .
Details of the affair have become public gradually over the past two years , mostly as a result of reporting by several newspapers .
In the midst of his 1988 re-election campaign , Sen. Riegle , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , returned $ 76,000 in contributions after a Detroit newspaper said that Mr. Keating had gathered the money for him about two weeks before the meeting with regulators .
Sen. DeConcini , after months of fending off intense press criticism , returned $ 48,000 only last month , shortly after the government formally accused Mr. Keating of defrauding Lincoln .
In addition , Sen. McCain last week disclosed that he belatedly had paid $ 13,433 to American Continental as reimbursement for trips he and his family took aboard the corporate jet to Mr. Keating 's vacation home at Cat Cay , the Bahamas , from 1984 through 1986 .
Sen. McCain said he had meant to pay for the trips at the time but that the matter `` fell between the cracks . ''
Mr. Keating , his family members and associates also donated $ 112,000 to Sen. McCain 's congressional campaigns over the years , according to press accounts .
But Sen. McCain says Mr. Keating broke off their friendship abruptly in 1987 , because the senator refused to press the thrift executive 's case as vigorously as Mr. Keating wanted .
`` He became very angry at that , left my office and told a number of people that I was a wimp , '' Sen. McCain recalls .
In July , California newspapers disclosed that Mr. Keating gave $ 850,000 in corporate funds to three tax - exempt voter registration organizations in 1987 and 1988 at the behest of Sen. Cranston , who conceded that soliciting the money was `` a pretty stupid thing to do politically . ''
In addition , Sen. Cranston received $ 47,000 in campaign donations through Mr. Keating , and the California Democratic party received $ 85,000 in corporate donations for a 1986 get - out - the - vote drive that benefited the senator 's re-election campaign that year .
Also in July , Ohio newspapers disclosed $ 200,000 in corporate donations by Mr. Keating to the National Council on Public Policy , a political committee controlled by Sen. Glenn .
That was in addition to $ 34,000 in direct campaign donations arranged by Mr. Keating to the Ohio senator .
Mr. Wertheimer said the Senate Ethics Committee should hire a special outside counsel to conduct an investigation , as was done in the case of former House Speaker James Wright .
Wilson Abney , staff director of the ethics panel , would n't comment .
Sen. Riegle said he would cooperate with any inquiry , but that his conduct had been `` entirely proper . ''
Sen. McCain said he had been `` deeply concerned '' at the time of the meeting that it might seem to be improper , but decided it was `` entirely appropriate '' for him to seek fair treatment for a constituent .
Sen. Glenn said he had already made a complete disclosure of his role in the affair and `` I am completely satisfied to let this matter rest in the hands of the Senate Ethics Committee . ''
Sen. DeConcini said , `` When all is said and done , I expect to be fully exonerated . ''
Sen. Cranston , who had already volunteered his help to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in any investigation of Mr. Keating , portrayed his role in 1987 as prodding regulators to act .
`` Why did n't the Bank Board act sooner ? '' he said .
`` That is what Common Cause should ask be investigated .
Recognition Equipment Inc. said it settled a civil action filed against it by the federal government on behalf of the U.S. Postal Service .
The government sued the company in April , seeking $ 23,000 and other unspecified damages related to an alleged contract - steering scheme .
The suit named the company , former chief executive officer William G. Moore Jr. , former vice president Robert W. Reedy and five defendants who were n't part of the company .
The suit charged the defendants with causing Peter E. Voss , an ex-member of the Postal Service board of governors , to accept $ 23,000 in bribes , kickbacks and gratuities .
Mr. Voss was previously sentenced to four years in prison and fined $ 11,000 for his role in the scheme .
In the agreement , Recognition agreed to pay the government $ 20,000 in return for the release of all claims against the company , Mr. Moore and Mr. Reedy .
The five additional defendants were n't parties to the settlement .
A trial on criminal allegations against the company and the same two former executives began Sept. 27 in federal court for the District of Columbia .
They were indicted last October on charges of fraud , theft and conspiracy related to an effort to win $ 400 million in Postal Service equipment contracts by the maker of data management equipment .
The company and its executives deny the charges .
In a related development , Recognition Equipment said the Postal Service has barred the company from bidding on postal contracts for an additional 120 days .
The Postal Service originally suspended the company Oct. 7 , 1988 , and has been renewing the ban ever since .
The company said it will continue to pursue a lifting of the suspension .
First Chicago Corp. posted a third - quarter loss of $ 23.3 million after joining other big banks in further adding to its reserves for losses on foreign loans .
The parent company of First National Bank of Chicago , with $ 48 billion in assets , said it set aside $ 200 million to absorb losses on loans and investments in financially troubled countries .
The addition , on top of two big 1987 additions to foreign - loan reserves , brings the reserve to a level equaling 79 % of medium - term and long - term loans outstanding to troubled nations .
First Chicago since 1987 has reduced its loans to such nations to $ 1.7 billion from $ 3 billion .
Despite this loss , First Chicago said it does n't need to sell stock to raise capital .
During the quarter , the company realized a pretax gain of $ 60.4 million from the sale of its First Chicago Investment Advisors unit .
Combined foreign exchange and bond trading profits dipped 24 % against last year 's third quarter , to $ 38.2 million from $ 50.5 million .
Gains from First Chicago 's venture capital unit , a big leveraged buy - out investor , rose 32 % to $ 34 million from $ 25.7 million a year ago .
Interest income and most fee income was strong .
Proposals for government - operated `` national service , '' like influenza , flare up from time to time , depress the resistance of the body politic , run their course , and seem to disappear , only to mutate and afflict public life anew .
The disease metaphor comes to mind , of course , not as an aspersion on the advocates of national service .
Rather , it is born of frustration with having to combat constantly changing strains of a statist idea that one thought had been eliminated in the early 1970s , along with smallpox .
It is back with us again , in the form of legislation to pay volunteers under a `` National and Community Service Act , '' a proposal with a serious shot at congressional passage this fall .
Why does the national - service virus keep coming back ?
Perhaps it is because utopian nostalgia evokes both military experience and the social gospel .
If only we could get America 's wastrel youth into at least a psychic uniform we might be able to teach self - discipline again and revive the spirit of giving .
A quarter of a century ago national service was promoted as a way of curing the manifest inequities of the draft -- by , of all things , expanding the draft .
Those of us who resisted the idea then suspect today that an obligation of government service for all young people is still the true long - term aim of many national - service backers , despite their protests that present plans contain no coercion .
Choice of the volunteer military in the 1970s seemed to doom national service as much as the draft .
But the virus was kept alive in sociology departments until a couple of years ago , when it again was let loose .
This time it attempted to invade two connected problems , the rising cost of higher education and the rising expense to the federal government of educational grants and loans .
Why not keep and even expand the loans and grants , the advocates reasoned , but require some form of service from each recipient ?
Military service , moreover , could be a national - service option .
Thus , undoubtedly it was hoped that the new strain of national service would prove contagious , infecting patriotic conservatives , pay - as - you - go moderates , and idealistic liberals .
The Democratic Leadership Council , a centrist group sponsoring the plan , surely thought it might help the party to attract support , especially among college students and their parents .
A provision allowing grants to be applied to first - home purchases was added to appeal to those who had had enough of schooling .
The DLC plan envisaged `` volunteers '' planting trees , emptying bedpans , tutoring children , and assisting librarians for $ 100 a week , tax free , plus medical care .
With a tax - free $ 10,000 voucher payment at the end of each year , the volunteers would be making a wage comparable to $ 17,500 a year .
Mind you , most of `` the volunteers '' would be unskilled 17 - to 18 - year - olds , some not even high school graduates , and many saving money by living at home .
They would be doing better financially under national service than many taxpayers working at the same kinds of jobs and perhaps supporting families .
As it happened , political resistance developed among educational and minority interests that count on the present education grant system , so the national - service devotees decided to abandon the supposedly crucial principle of `` give in order to get . ''
Opposition to national service from the Pentagon , which wants to protect its own recruitment process , also led to the military - service option being dropped .
Clearly , a new rationale for national service had to be cooked up .
What better place to turn than Sen. Edward Kennedy 's Labor Committee , that great stove of government expansionism , where many a stagnant pot of porridge is kept on the back burner until it can be brought forward and presented as nouvelle cuisine ?
In this case , the new recipe for national service called for throwing many assorted legislative leftovers into one kettle : a demonstration project for educational aid -LRB- particularly satisfying to the DLC and Sen. Sam Nunn -RRB- , a similar demonstration program for youth conservation -LRB- a la Sen. Chris Dodd -RRB- , a competitive grants program to states to spark youth and senior citizen volunteer projects -LRB- a Kennedy specialty -RRB- , a community service work - study program for students -LRB- pleasing to the palate of Sen. Dale Bumpers , among others -RRB- , plus engorgement of the VISTA volunteer program and the Retired Senior Volunteer , Foster Grandparent , and Senior Companion programs .
Before the menu is printed , the House may add more ingredients , also changing the initial price , now posted at some $ 330 million .
It is widely known that `` too many cooks spoil the broth , '' but that wisdom does not necessarily reflect the view of the cooks , especially if they are senators .
The `` omnibus '' bill coming out of Congress may be unwholesome glop , but the assorted chefs are happy and the restaurant is pushing the dish very hard .
The aroma of patronage is in the air .
Is the voluntary sector so weak that it needs such unsolicited assistance ?
On the contrary , it is as robust as ever .
According to the Gallup Poll , American adults contribute an average of two hours a week of service , while financial contributions to charity in the 1980s have risen 30 % -LRB- adjusted for inflation -RRB- .
Even if government does see various `` unmet needs , '' national service is not the way to meet them .
If we want to support students , we might adopt the idea used in other countries of offering more scholarships based on something called `` scholarship , '' rather than on the government 's idea of `` service . ''
Or we might provide a tax credit for working students .
What we do not need to do is start a war , and then try to justify it by creating a GI Bill .
To the extent we lack manpower to staff menial jobs in hospitals , for example , we should raise pay , pursue labor - saving technology , or allow more legal immigration , rather than overpay high school graduates as short - term workers and cause resentment among permanent workers paid lesser amounts to do the same jobs .
Will national service , in the current highly politicized and opportunistic form exert enough appeal to get adopted ?
Not necessarily .
Polls show wide , generalized support for some vague concept of service , but the bill now under discussion lacks any passionate public backing .
Nonetheless , Senate Democrats are organizing a roll of supporting `` associations , '' `` societies '' and `` councils , '' some of which may hope to receive the paid `` volunteers . ''
So far , the president seems ill - disposed to substitute any of the omnibus for his own free - standing proposal to endow a `` Points of Light '' foundation with $ 25 million to inform citizens of all ages and exhort them to genuine volunteerism .
However , even this admirable plan could become objectionable if the White House gives in to congressional Democratic pressure to add to the scope of the president 's initiative or to involve the independent foundation in `` brokering '' federal funds for volunteer projects .
There 's no need for such concessions .
The omnibus can be defeated , the virus controlled , and real service protected .
National service , the utopian idea , still wo n't go away then , of course , but the millions of knee - socked youth performing works of `` civic content '' will be mobilized only in the imagination of their progenitors .
Mr. Chapman is a fellow at the Indianapolis - based Hudson Institute .
This article is adapted from remarks at a Hoover Institution conference on national service , in which Mr. Szanton also participated .
American Physicians Service Group Inc. said it purchased about 42 % of Prime Medical Services Inc. for about $ 5 million from Texas American Energy Corp .
American Physicians said it also replaced four Texas American representatives on Prime 's five - member board .
American provides a variety of financial services to doctors and hospitals .
Prime , based in Bedminster , N.J. , provides management services to cardiac rehabilitation clinics and diagnostic imaging centers .
For the year ended June 30 , Prime had a net loss of $ 3 million on sales of $ 13.8 million .
Investcorp , New York , said it and the management of Sports & Recreation Inc. bought the operator of the 10 - store Sports Unlimited chain for some $ 40 million .
The investment bank becomes majority shareholder in Sports & Recreation , a 10 - year - old sporting goods retailer , said Oliver E. Richardson , a member of Investcorp 's management committee and a director of the chain .
Sports Unlimited , Tampa , Fla. , posted revenue of $ 59 million for the year ended July 31 .
The company is `` very profitable '' on an operating basis , Mr. Richardson said , but he declined to specify numbers .
In 1982 , Sports & Recreation 's managers and certain passive investors purchased the company from Brunswick Corp. of Skokie , Ill .
In the latest transaction , management bought out the passive investors ' holding , Mr. Richardson said .
Business Week subscribers may hear this week 's issue talking back to them .
A four - page ad from Texas Instruments Inc. , running in approximately 140,000 issues of the Oct. 20 `` Corporate Elite '' issue of the McGraw - Hill Inc. publication , contains a speech synthesizer laminated between two of the pages .
Readers who pull off a piece of tape and press a switch will hear a tiny -- but distinctly human - sounding -- voice announce , `` I am the talking chip , '' as it launches into a 15 - second discourse on its own attributes .
The talking chip is n't cheap -- the per - ad cost to Texas Instruments is about $ 4 , and that 's without adding in Business Week 's charge -- but Texas Instruments believes it is a first .
Previous efforts have included musical ads , featuring simple tone - generating chips that play a tune , but the voice synthesizer in this effort is much more sophisticated , with none of the robotic flatness that one hears , for example , when calling telephone directory services .
And for those who miss the message the first time around , not to worry : Three tiny batteries provide enough juice for as many as 650 replays .
For 20 years , federal rules have barred the three major television networks from sharing in one of the most lucrative and fastest - growing parts of the television business .
And for six years , NBC , ABC and CBS have negotiated with Hollywood studios in a futile attempt to change that .
But with foreign companies snapping up U.S. movie studios , the networks are pressing their fight harder than ever .
They hope the foreign deals will divide the Hollywood opposition and prod Congress to push for ending federal rules that prohibit the networks from grabbing a piece of rerun sales and owning part of the shows they put on the air .
Even network executives , however , admit privately that victory -- either in Congress or in talks with the studios -- is highly doubtful any time soon .
And so the networks also are pushing for new ways to sidestep the `` fin - syn '' provisions , known formally as the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules .
That became clear last week with the disclosure that National Broadcasting Co. , backed by the deep pockets of parent General Electric Co. , had tried to help fund Qintex Australia Ltd. 's now - scuttled $ 1.5 billion bid for MGM / UA Communications Co .
NBC 's interest may revive the deal , which MGM / UA killed last week when the Australian concern had trouble raising cash .
Even if that deal is n't revived , NBC hopes to find another .
`` Our doors are open , '' an NBC spokesman says .
NBC may yet find a way to take a passive , minority interest in a program - maker without violating the rules .
And any NBC effort could prompt CBS Inc. and ABC 's parent , Capital Cities / ABC Inc. , to look for ways of skirting the fin - syn regulations .
But the networks ' push may only aggravate an increasingly bitter rift between them and Hollywood studios .
Both sides are to sit down next month for yet another meeting on how they might agree on reducing fin - syn restraints .
Few people privy to the talks expect the studios to budge .
The networks still are `` uninhibited in their authority '' over what shows get on the air , charges Motion Picture Association President Jack Valenti , the most vociferous opponent of rescinding the rules .
Studios are `` powerless '' to get shows in prime - time lineups and keep them there long enough to go into lucrative rerun sales , he contends .
And that 's why the rules , for the most part , must stay in place , he says .
Studio executives in on the talks - including officials at Paramount Communications Inc. , Fries Entertainment Inc. , Warner Communications Inc. and MCA Inc. -- declined to be interviewed .
But Mr. Valenti , who represents the studios , asserts : `` The whole production industry , to a man , is on the side of preserving '' the rules .
Such proclamations leave network officials all the more doubtful that the studios will bend .
`` They do n't seem to have an incentive to negotiate , '' says one network executive .
`` And there 's no indication that Washington is prepared to address the rules .
That 's the problem , is n't it ? ''
Indeed it is .
Congress has said repeatedly it wants no part of the mess , urging the studios and the networks , which license rights to air shows made by the studios , to work out their own compromise .
But recent developments have made the networks -- and NBC President Robert Wright , in particular -- ever more adamant that the networks must be unshackled to survive .
The latest provocation : Sony Corp. 's plan to acquire Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. for $ 3.4 billion , and to buy independent producer Guber Peters Entertainment Co. for $ 200 million .
`` I wonder what Walter Cronkite will think of the Sony / Columbia Broadcast System Trinitron Evening News with Dan Rather broadcast exclusively from Tokyo , '' wrote J.B. Holston , an NBC vice president , in a commentary in last week 's issue of Broadcasting magazine .
In his article , Mr. Holston , who was in Europe last week and unavailable , complained that the `` archaic restraints '' in fin - syn rules have `` contributed directly to the acquisition of the studios by non-U.S. enterprises .
'' -LRB- He did n't mention that NBC , in the meantime , was hoping to assist Australia 's Qintex in buying
An NBC spokesman counters that Mr. Holston 's lament was `` entirely consistent '' with NBC plans because the U.S. rules would limit NBC 's involvement in the Qintex deal so severely as to be `` light years away from the type of unrestrained deals available to Sony -- and everyone else except the three networks . ''
The Big Three 's drumbeat for deregulation began intensifying in the summer when the former Time Inc. went ahead with plans to acquire Warner .
Although Time already had a long - term contract to buy movies from Warner , the merger will let Time 's largely unregulated pay - cable channel , Home Box Office , own the Warner movies aired on HBO -- a vertical integration that is effectively blocked by fin - syn regulations .
NBC 's Mr. Wright led the way in decrying the networks ' inability to match a Time - Warner combination .
He spoke up again when the Sony bid for Columbia was announced .
Since NBC 's interest in the Qintex bid for MGM / UA was disclosed , Mr. Wright has n't been available for comment .
With a Qintex deal , NBC would move into uncharted territory -- possibly raising hackles at the studios and in Washington .
`` It 's never really been tested , '' says William Lilley III , who as a top CBS executive spent years lobbying to have the rules lifted .
He now runs Policy Communications in Washington , consulting to media companies .
Fin - syn rules do n't explicitly block a network from buying a passive , small stake in a company that profits from the rerun syndication networks ca n't enjoy .
Hence , NBC might be able to take , say , a 5 % stake in a company such as MGM / UA .
If the transaction raised objections , the studio 's syndication operations could be spun off into a separate firm in which the network does n't have a direct stake .
But such convolutions would still block the networks from grabbing a big chunk of the riches of syndication .
Under current rules , even when a network fares well with a 100 % - owned series -- ABC , for example , made a killing in broadcasting its popular crime / comedy `` Moonlighting '' -- it is n't allowed to share in the continuing proceeds when the reruns are sold to local stations .
Instead , ABC will have to sell off the rights for a one - time fee .
The networks admit that the chances of getting the relief they want are slim -- for several years at the least .
Six years ago they were tantalizingly close .
The Reagan - era Federal Communications Commission had ruled in favor of killing most of the rules .
Various evidence , including a Brookings Institution study of some 800 series that the networks had aired and had partly owned in the 1960s , showed the networks did n't wield undue control over the studios as had been alleged .
But just eight days before the rules were to die , former President Ronald Reagan , a one - time actor , intervened on behalf of Hollywood .
The FCC effort collapsed .
The networks and studios have bickered ever since .
Network officials involved in the studio talks may hope the foreign influx builds more support in Washington , but that seems unlikely .
In Congress , the issue falters : It 's about money , not program quality , and Hollywood has lots of clout given its fund raising for senators and representatives overseeing the issue .
A spokesman for Rep. Edward J. Markey -LRB- D - Mass. -RRB- , who heads a subcommittee that oversees the FCC , says Mr. Markey feels `` the world has been forever changed by the Sony - Columbia deal . ''
But he said Mr. Markey hopes this pushes the networks and studios to work it out on their own .
And at the FCC , meanwhile , new Chairman Alfred C. Sikes has said he wants the two sides to hammer out their own plan .
Dismal sales at General Motors Corp. dragged the U.S. car and truck market down below year - ago levels in early October , the first sales period of the 1990 model year .
The eight major domestic auto makers sold 160,510 North American - made cars in the first 10 days of October , a 12.6 % drop from a year earlier .
Domestically built truck sales were down 10.4 % to 86,555 pickups , vans and sport utility vehicles .
The heavy use of incentives to clear out 1989 models appears to have taken the steam , at least initially , out of 1990 model sales , which began officially Oct. 1 .
This appears particularly true at GM , which had strong sales in August and September but saw its early October car and truck results fall 26.3 % from last year 's unusually high level .
Overall , sales of all domestic - made vehicles fell 11.9 % from a year ago .
Without GM , overall sales for the other U.S. automakers were roughly flat with 1989 results .
Some of the U.S. auto makers have already adopted incentives on many 1990 models , but they may have to broaden their programs to keep sales up .
`` We 've created a condition where , without incentives , it 's a tough market , '' said Tom Kelly , sales manager for Bill Wink Chevrolet in Dearborn , Mich .
Car sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual selling rate of 5.8 million vehicles , the lowest since October 1987 .
The poor performance contrasts with a robust selling rate of almost eight million last month .
Furthermore , dealers contacted late last week said they could n't see any immediate impact on sales of Friday 's steep market decline .
GM 's domestic car sales dropped 24.3 % and its domestic trucks were down an even steeper 28.7 % from the same period a year ago .
All of the GM divisions except Cadillac showed big declines .
Cadillac posted a 3.2 % increase despite new competition from Lexus , the fledging luxury - car division of Toyota Motor Corp .
Lexus sales were n't available ; the cars are imported and Toyota reports their sales only at month - end .
The sales drop for the No. 1 car maker may have been caused in part by the end in September of dealer incentives that GM offered in addition to consumer rebates and low - interest financing , a company spokesman said .
Last year , GM had a different program in place that continued rewarding dealers until all the 1989 models had been sold .
Aside from GM , other car makers posted generally mixed results .
Ford Motor Co. had a 1.8 % drop in domestic car sales but a 2.4 % increase in domestic truck sales .
Chrysler Corp. had a 7.5 % drop in car sales , echoing its generally slow performance all year .
However , sales of trucks , including the company 's popular minivans , rose 4.3 % .
Honda Motor Co. 's sales of domestically built vehicles plunged 21.7 % from a year earlier .
Honda 's plant in Marysville , Ohio , was gearing up to build 1990 model Accords , a Honda spokesman said .
`` We 're really confident everything will bounce back to normal , '' he added .
Separately , Chrysler said firm prices on its 1990 - model domestic cars and minivans will rise an average of 5 % over comparably equipped 1989 models .
Firm prices were generally in line with the tentative prices announced earlier this fall .
At that time , Chrysler said base prices , which are n't adjusted for equipment changes , would rise between 4 % and 9 % on most vehicle .
a - Totals include only vehicle sales reported in period .
c - Domestic car
d - Percentage change is greater than 999 % .
x - There were 8 selling days in the most recent period and 8 a year earlier .
Percentage differences based on daily sales rate rather than sales volume .
It all seemed innocent enough : Last April , one Steven B. Iken visited Justin Products Inc. here , identified himself as a potential customer and got the word on the little company 's new cassette players for children .
`` It is almost identical to the Sony product , '' Mr. Iken remarked , after seeing prototypes and pictures .
Replied a Justin salesman : `` Exactly . ''
The Justin merchandise carried wholesale prices some 40 % below those of Sony Corp. of Japan 's `` My First Sony '' line .
The visitor waxed enthusiastic and promised to return .
But instead of a new customer -- part of a hoped - for bonanza from underselling Sony -- Justin got a costly legal morass .
Mr. Iken , it turned out , was a private detective using a hidden tape recorder to gather information for Sony .
His recording later turned up as a court exhibit .
Seeking to keep Justin 's `` My Own '' product line off the U.S. market , Sony last May filed a suit in Manhattan federal court accusing the upstart of trademark infringement , unfair competition and other violations of business law .
Since then , life has changed a lot for 61 - year - old Leonard Kaye , Justin 's owner .
`` I have n't been able to get a decent night 's sleep since this has been going on , '' he says .
`` It 's the most distracting thing in my life -- I ca n't even attend to my business . ''
His company -LRB- annual sales : about $ 25 million -RRB- may suffer a costly blow -- losing an estimated 10 % of total sales -- if Sony -LRB- annual sales : about $ 16 billion -RRB- prevails .
Justin 's plight shows what can happen when a tiny company suddenly faces the full legal might of a wrathful multinational .
With considerable irony , the case also shows how completely Japan has turned the tables on U.S. business .
Americans used to complain bitterly about being undersold by look - alike products from Japan .
Now Sony , whose innovative , premium - priced products are among the most admired in consumer electronics , is bitterly complaining about a little U.S. firm with a cheap look - alike produced in China .
`` The gist of this is that Justin knocked off the Sony line and Sony wants to stop it , '' says Lewis H. Eslinger , Sony 's attorney , who previously guarded Rubik 's Cube .
-LRB- Sony itself declines to comment . -RRB-
If Sony wins , Mr. Eslinger says , its little rival will have to try to sell the products overseas .
At worst , he adds , `` They 'd have to grind them all up and throw them away . ''
Mr. Kaye denies the suit 's charges and says his only mistake was taking on Sony in the marketplace .
`` I made a similar line and I produced it cheaper , '' he says .
Today , U.S. Judge John E. Sprizzo is expected to rule on Sony 's renewed request for a pre-trial order blocking sale of the disputed products , on which deliveries began in July .
The judge turned down an earlier Sony request for such an order -- a decision upheld on appeal -- but Sony returned with additional evidence and arguments .
Though hoping to settle the case , Justin vows to fight on , if necessary .
But the battle is more than Justin bargained for .
`` I had no idea I was getting in so deep , '' says Mr. Kaye , who founded Justin in 1982 .
Mr. Kaye had sold Capetronic Inc. , a Taiwan electronics maker , and retired , only to find he was bored .
With Justin , he began selling toys and electronics made mostly in Hong Kong , beginning with Mickey Mouse radios .
The company has grown -- to about 40 employees , from four initially , Mr. Kaye says .
Justin has been profitable since 1986 , adds the official , who shares his office with numerous teddy bears , all samples from his line of plush toys .
Like many others , Mr. Kaye took notice in 1987 when Sony , in a classic example of market segmentation , changed the plastic skin and buttons on the famous Walkman line of portable audio equipment and created the My First Sony line for children .
The brightly colored new products looked more like toys than the adult models .
-LRB- In court papers , Sony says it has spent more than $ 3 million to promote the line , with resulting sales of over a million units . -RRB-
Sony found a new market niche , but Mr. Kaye figured that its prices left plenty of room for a lower - priced competitor .
His products are n't exact copies of Sony 's but strongly resemble them in size , shape and , especially , color .
Sony uses mostly red and blue , with traces of yellow -- and so does Justin , on the theory that kids prefer these colors .
-LRB- `` To be successful , a product can be any color whatsoever , as long as it is fire - engine red , '' says Charles E. Baxley , Justin 's attorney . -RRB-
By last winter , Justin was showing prototypes at toy fairs in Hong Kong and New York -- and Sony noticed .
Indeed , concerned that Sony sales personnel were threatening legal action or other retaliation -- such as withholding desirable Sony products -- against Justin 's customers , Mr. Baxley fired off a letter to Sony in April .
He himself threatened to take the matter to the Federal Trade Commission or U.S. Justice Department .
But Justin has n't pursued those charges -LRB- which were without merit , according to Mr. Eslinger , the Sony attorney -RRB- .
Recalls Mr. Baxley : `` Our purpose was to influence them to leave us alone .
We never intended taking on Sony -- we do n't have the resources . ''
Sony answered the empty threat with its real suit .
Off and on since then , the companies have skirmished in court .
And Justin , in a news release , says , `` Once competitive , Sony now resorts to strong - arm tactics in American courtrooms to carve out and protect niche markets . ''
Sony 's lawyer insists that the company 's tactics -- including the use of a private detective posing as a buyer -- are routine in such matters .
He also insists that Sony , no less than others , has a legal right to protect its `` trade dress , '' in this case , mostly the colors that it claims make My First Sony products distinctive .
-LRB- Justin claims it began using the same colors on electronic goods for children long before Sony entered the children 's market . -RRB-
Whatever its merits , Sony 's aggressive defense is debilitating for Justin .
It 's also costly .
Mr. Kaye says he has paid more than $ 70,000 in legal fees so far .
Of Sony , Mr. Kaye says : `` They know there 's no way for them to lose .
They just keep digging me in deeper until I reach the point where I give up and go away . ''
For now , though , he vows to hang in .
Walter Sisulu and the African National Congress came home yesterday .
After 26 years in prison , Mr. Sisulu , the 77 - year - old former secretary - general of the liberation movement , was dropped off at his house by a prison services ' van just as the sun was coming up .
At the same time , six ANC colleagues , five of whom were arrested with him in 1963 and sentenced to life imprisonment , were reunited with their families at various places around the country .
And as the graying men returned to their homes , the ANC , outlawed in South Africa since 1960 and still considered to be the chief public enemy by the white government , defiantly returned to the streets of the country 's black townships .
A huge ANC flag , with black , green and gold stripes , was hoisted over the rickety gate at Mr. Sisulu 's modest house , while on the street out front , boys displayed the ANC colors on their shirts , caps and scarves .
At the small four - room home of Elias Motsoaledi , a leading ANC unionist and a former commander in the group 's armed wing , Umkhonto we Sizwe , well - wishers stuck little ANC flags in their hair and a man tooted on an antelope horn wrapped in ANC ribbons .
`` I am happy to see the spirit of the people , '' said Mr. Sisulu , looking dapper in a new gray suit .
As the crowd outside his home shouted `` ANC , ANC , '' the old man shot his fists into the air .
`` I 'm inspired by the mood of the people . ''
Under the laws of the land , the ANC remains an illegal organization , and its headquarters are still in Lusaka , Zambia .
But the unconditional release of the seven leaders , who once formed the intellectual and organizational core of the ANC , is a de facto unbanning of the movement and the rebirth of its internal wing .
`` The government can never put the ANC back into the bottle again , '' said Cassim Saloojee , a veteran anti-apartheid activist on hand to welcome Mr. Sisulu .
`` Things have gone too far for the government to stop them now .
There 's no turning back . ''
There was certainly no stopping the tide of ANC emotion last night , when hundreds of people jammed into the Holy Cross Anglican Church in Soweto for what became the first ANC rally in the country in 30 years .
Deafening chants of `` ANC '' and `` Umkhonto we Sizwe '' shook the church as the seven aging men vowed that the ANC would continue its fight against the government and the policies of racial segregation on all fronts , including the armed struggle .
And they called on the government to release Nelson Mandela , the ANC 's leading figure , who was jailed with them and remains in prison .
Without him , said Mr. Sisulu , the freeing of the others `` is only a half - measure . ''
President F.W. de Klerk released the ANC men -- along with one of the founding members of the Pan Africanist Congress , a rival liberation group -- as part of his efforts to create a climate of trust and peace in which his government can begin negotiations with black leaders over a new constitution aimed at giving blacks a voice in national government .
But Pretoria may instead be creating a climate for more turmoil and uncertainty in this racially divided country .
As other repressive governments , particularly Poland and the Soviet Union , have recently discovered , initial steps to open up society can create a momentum for radical change that becomes difficult , if not impossible , to control .
As the days go by , the South African government will be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued imprisonment of Mr. Mandela as well as the continued banning of the ANC and enforcement of the state of emergency .
If it does n't yield on these matters , and eventually begin talking directly to the ANC , the expectations and promise raised by yesterday 's releases will turn to disillusionment and unrest .
If it does , the large number of right - wing whites , who oppose any concessions to the black majority , will step up their agitation and threats to take matters into their own hands .
The newly released ANC leaders also will be under enormous pressure .
The government is watching closely to see if their presence in the townships leads to increased anti-government protests and violence ; if it does , Pretoria will use this as a reason to keep Mr. Mandela behind bars .
Pretoria has n't forgotten why they were all sentenced to life imprisonment in the first place : for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government .
In addition , the government is figuring that the releases could create a split between the internal and external wings of the ANC and between the newly freed leaders and those activists who have emerged as leaders inside the country during their imprisonment .
In order to head off any divisions , Mr. Mandela , in a meeting with his colleagues before they were released , instructed them to report to the ANC headquarters in Lusaka as soon as possible .
The men also will be faced with bridging the generation gap between themselves and the country 's many militant black youths , the so - called young lions who are anxious to see the old lions in action .
Says Peter Mokaba , president of the South African Youth Congress : `` We will be expecting them to act like leaders of the ANC . ''
They never considered themselves to be anything else .
At last night 's rally , they called on their followers to be firm , yet disciplined , in their opposition to apartheid .
`` We emphasize discipline because we know that the government is very , very sensitive , '' said Andrew Mlangeni , another early Umkhonto leader who is now 63 .
`` We want to see Nelson Mandela and all our comrades out of prison , and if we are n't disciplined we may not see them here with us .
Roger Rosenblatt , editor of U.S. News & World Report , resigned Friday from the weekly news magazine .
Mr. Rosenblatt said he resigned because of difficulties with commuting between his home in New York and the magazine 's editorial offices in Washington .
`` Frankly , I missed my family , '' said Mr. Rosenblatt .
In Mr. Rosenblatt 's tenure , the magazine 's advertising pages and circulation have grown significantly .
But at 2.3 million weekly paid circulation , U.S. News still ranks third behind Time Warner Inc. 's Time magazine , with 4.4 million circulation , and Washington Post Co. 's Newsweek , with 3.3 million circulation .
Mortimer B. Zuckerman , chairman and editor in chief , said Mr. Rosenblatt would be succeeded starting today by Michael Ruby , the magazine 's executive editor , and Merrill McLoughlin , a senior writer .
Mr. Ruby and Ms. McLoughlin are married to each other .
Mr. Zuckerman said his magazine would maintain its editorial format , which is a mix of analysis and trend stories with service - oriented , how - to articles .
Mr. Rosenblatt , a senior writer at Time magazine before joining U.S. News & World Report , said he had numerous job offers from other magazines while he was editor .
The offers were to work as a writer , not an editor .
He said he will now consider those offers .

When research projects are curtailed due to government funding cuts , are we `` caught with our grants down '' ?

When China opened its doors to foreign investors in 1979 , toy makers from Hong Kong were among the first to march in .
Today , with about 75 % of the companies ' products being made in China , the chairman of the Hong Kong Toys Council , Dennis Ting , has suggested a new sourcing label : `` Made in China by Hong Kong Companies . ''
The toy makers were pushed across the border by rising labor and land costs in the British colony .
But in the wake of the shootings in Beijing on June 4 , the Hong Kong toy industry is worrying about its strong dependence on China .
Although the manufacturers stress that production has n't been affected by China 's political turmoil , they are looking for additional sites .
The toy makers , and their foreign buyers , cite uncertainty about China 's economic and political policies .
`` Nobody wants to have all his eggs in one basket , '' says David Yeh , chairman and chief executive officer of International Matchbox Group Ltd .
Indeed , Matchbox and other leading Hong Kong toy makers were setting up factories in Southeast Asia , especially in Thailand , long before the massacre .
Their steps were partly prompted by concern over a deterioration of business conditions in southern China .
By diversifying supply sources , the toy makers do n't intend to withdraw from China , manufacturers and foreign buyers say .
It would n't be easy to duplicate quickly the manufacturing capacity built up in southern China during the past decade .
A supply of cheap labor and the access to Hong Kong 's port , airport , banks and support industries , such as printing companies , have made China 's Guangdong province a premier manufacturing site .
`` South China is the most competitive source of toys in the world , '' says Henry Hu , executive director of Wah Shing Toys Consolidated Ltd .
Hong Kong trade figures illustrate the toy makers ' reliance on factories across the border .
In 1988 , exports of domestically produced toys and games fell 19 % from 1987 , to HK$ 10.05 billion -LRB- US$ 1.29 billion -RRB- .
But re-exports , mainly from China , jumped 75 % , to HK$ 15.92 billion .
In 1989 's first seven months , domestic exports fell 29 % , to HK$ 3.87 billion , while re-exports rose 56 % , to HK$ 11.28 billion .
Manufacturers say there is no immediate substitute for southern China , where an estimated 120,000 people are employed by the toy industry .
`` For the next few years , like it or not , China is going to be the main supplier , '' says Edmund Young , vice president of Perfecta Enterprises Ltd. , one of the first big Hong Kong toy makers to move across the border .
In the meantime , as manufacturers and buyers seek new sites , they are focusing mainly on Southeast Asia .
Several big companies have established manufacturing joint ventures in Thailand , including Matchbox , Wah Shing and Kader Industrial Co. , the toy manufacturer headed by Mr. Ting .
Malaysia , the Philippines and Indonesia also are being studied .
With the European Community set to remove its internal trade barriers in 1992 , several Hong Kong companies are beginning to consider Spain , Portugal and Greece as possible manufacturing sites .
Worries about China came just as Hong Kong 's toy industry was recovering from a 1987 sales slump and bankruptcy filings by two major U.S. companies , Worlds of Wonder Inc. and Coleco Industries Inc .
Hong Kong manufacturers say large debt writeoffs and other financial problems resulting from the 1987 difficulties chastened the local industry , causing it to tighten credit policies and financial management .
The industry regards last year and this year as a period of recovery that will lead to improved results .
Still , they long for a `` mega-hit '' toy to excite retail sales in the U.S. , Hong Kong 's biggest market for toys and games .
The closest thing the colony 's companies have to a U.S. mega-hit this year is the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series of action figures manufactured by Playmates Holdings Ltd .
Introduced in mid-1988 , the 15 - centimeter - tall plastic turtles are based on an American comic book and television series .
Paul Kwan , managing director of Playmates , says 10 million Ninja Turtles have been sold , placing the reptilian warriors among the 10 biggest - selling toys in the U.S. .
Should sales continue to be strong through the Christmas season , which accounts for about 60 % of U.S. retail toy sales , Mr. Kwan said the Ninja Turtles could make 1989 a record sales year for Playmates .
Other Hong Kong manufacturers expect their results to improve only slightly this year from 1988 .
Besides the lack of a fast - selling product , they cite the continued dominance of the U.S. market by Nintendo Entertainment System , an expensive video game made by Nintendo Co. of Japan .
Nintendo buyers have little money left to spend on other products .
Many of the toy makers ' problems started well before June 4 as a result of overstrained infrastructure and Beijing 's austerity programs launched late last year .
Toy makers complain that electricity in Guangdong has been provided only three days a week in recent months , down from five days a week , as the province 's rapid industrialization has outstripped its generating capacity .
Manufacturers are upgrading standby power plants .
Bank credit for China investments all but dried up following June 4 .
Also , concern exists that the harder - line Beijing leadership will tighten its control of Guangdong , which has been the main laboratory for the open - door policy and economic reforms .
But , toy manufacturers and other industrialists say Beijing will be restrained from tightening controls on export - oriented southern China .
They say China 's trade deficit is widening and the country is too short of foreign exchange for it to hamper production in Guangdong .
`` The Chinese leaders have to decide whether they want control or whether the want exports , '' says Mr. Kwan of Playmates .
The inflation - adjusted growth rate for France 's gross domestic product for the second quarter was revised upward to 0.8 % from the previous three months from the initial estimate of 0.7 % , the National Statistics Institute said .
The state agency said the latest revision left the growth rate for the first - quarter compared with the previous three months unchanged at 1.3 % .
If the economy continues to expand by 0.8 % a quarter for the rest of the year , it would leave GDP growth for all of 1989 at 3 % , the institute said .
That would be down from the 3.8 % rise posted in 1988 .
Striking auto workers ended their 19 - day occupation of a metal shop at a Peugeot S.A. factory in eastern France Friday as pay talks got under way in the capital .
But the Peugeot breakthrough came as a nationwide dispute by Finance Ministry employees disrupted border checkpoints and threatened the government 's ability to pay its bills .
The Peugeot metalworkers began filing out of the shop , which makes auto parts , at the plant in Mulhouse after voting 589 to 193 to abandon the occupation .
Their withdrawal was based on promises by Peugeot to open negotiations in Paris at the same time the last man left the premises .
The strike by customs officers , tax collectors , treasury workers and other civil servants attached to the Ministry of Finance may pose a more serious challenge to the government and the average Frenchman .
Ministry employees complain that they are poorly paid because of a complex job - rating system they say fails to take into account their education and level of technical expertise .
Kysor Industrial Corp. said it expects its third - quarter net earnings to be between two cents and four cents a share , compared with 61 cents a share a year ago .
Analysts had been projecting that the company 's earnings would be between 25 cents and 30 cents a share .
The year - earlier third - quarter earnings amounted to $ 4.1 million .
The company said a drop in activity in the powerboat industry reduced sales volume at its two marine - related operations .
Also , the company said its commercial products operation failed to meet forecasts .
Kysor , a maker of heavy - duty truck and commercial refrigeration equipment , said it expects its fourth - quarter earnings to be more closely in line with usual levels , which are between 30 cents and 50 cents a share .
The first major event this morning in U.S. stock and futures trading may be a pause at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange .
Under a reform arising from the 1987 crash , trading in the Merc 's stock - index futures will break for 10 minutes if the contract opens and stays five points from Friday 's close , a move equal to 40 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
The aim of the interruption would be to ease the opening of the New York Stock Exchange , which would be hammered by such a volatile move on the Merc .
That early - morning breather is just one of a number of safeguards adopted after the 1987 crash .
The Big Board also added computer capacity to handle huge surges in trading volume .
Several of those post-crash changes kicked in during Friday 's one - hour collapse and worked as expected , even though they did n't prevent a stunning plunge .
But the major `` circuit breakers '' have yet to be evaluated .
A deeper market plunge today could give them their first test .
A further slide also would resurrect debate over a host of other , more sweeping changes proposed -- but not implemented -- after the last crash .
Most notably , several of the regulatory steps recommended by the Brady Task Force , which analyzed the 1987 crash , would be revived -- especially because that group 's chairman is now the Treasury secretary .
The most controversial of the Brady recommendations involved establishing a single overarching regulator to handle crucial cross-market questions , such as setting consistent margin requirements for the stock and futures markets .
But for the moment , attention focuses on the reforms that were put into place , and market regulators and participants said the circuit breakers worked as intended .
Big Board and Merc officials expressed satisfaction with the results of two limits imposed on of the Merc 's Standard & Poor 's 500 contract , as well as `` hot - line '' communications among exchanges .
Those pauses -- from 2:07 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. CDT and from 2:45 p.m. until the close of trading a half - hour later -- forced traders to buy and sell contracts at prices at or higher than their frozen levels .
During the first halt , after the S&P index had fallen 12 points , the Big Board 's `` Sidecar '' computer program automatically was triggered .
That system is designed to separate computer - generated program trades from all other trades to help exchange officials resolve order imbalances in individual stocks .
One Merc broker compared the action in the S&P pit during the two freezes to a fire at a well - drilled school .
`` You do n't want the fire but you know what to do , '' said Howard Dubnow , an independent floor broker and a Merc governor .
`` There was no panic .
The system worked the way we devised it to work . ''
After reopening for about 15 minutes , the S&P index tumbled to its 30 - point limit and the second freeze went into effect .
Traders then spent the last half - hour `` watching to see if the Dow would drop 250 points , '' Mr. Dubnow added , referring to the level at which the stock market itself would have closed for an hour .
One observer estimated that 80 % to 90 % of the S&P traders `` were just standing around watching . ''
But the 250 - point circuit breaker never had to kick in , and freezes on the Chicago Board of Trade 's Major Market Index also were n't triggered .
The MMI and the S&P 500 are the two major indexes used by program traders to run their computerized trading strategies .
The programs are considered by many to be a major cause of the 1987 crash .
The process of post-crash reforms began with calls to remake the markets and wound up a year later with a series of rather technical adjustments .
In October 1987 , just after the market drop , Washington was awash in talk of sweeping changes in the way the financial markets are structured and regulated .
Over the next year that grand agenda was whittled down to a series of steps to soften big stock drops by interrupting trading to give market players time to pause and reconsider positions .
In addition , limits were placed on computer - driven trading , and steps were taken to better link the stock and futures markets .
Few changes were made in the way the markets are regulated .
At the outset the prime target was program trading , which was much discussed but little understood on Capitol Hill .
There were also calls to strip the stock markets of `` derivative '' products , such as stock - index futures and options , which Federal Judge Stanley Sporkin , for example , likened to `` barnacles attached to the basic market . ''
And there was much criticism of the New York Stock Exchange 's system of having stock trades flow through specialists , or market makers .
When the Brady Task Force 's powerful analysis of the crash was released in January 1988 , it immediately reshaped the reformers ' agenda .
Arguing that the separate financial marketplaces acted as one , and concluding that the crash had `` raised the possibility of a full - scale financial system breakdown , '' the presidential task force called for establishing a super-regulator to oversee the markets , to make margins consistent across markets , to unify clearing systems and to install circuit breakers .
Only the last of those recommendations ever was implemented .
The Reagan White House held the Brady recommendations at arm 's length and named a second panel -- the Working Group on the Financial Markets -- to review its analysis and those of other crash studies .
In May 1988 , the Working Group , made up of representatives from the Federal Reserve , the Treasury , the Securities and Exchange Commission , and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , finally endorsed only circuit breakers .
After several more months of arguments among various stock exchanges and futures markets , circuit breakers were set in place , with the most notable suspending trading after 250 and 400 point drops in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
Privately , some free marketeers dismissed such mechanisms as sops to interventionists .
After all , this free - market argument went , the Dow only dropped more than 250 points once this century .
`` Circuit breakers '' set to soften big drops :
-- If S&P futures fall 5 points at opening , contract trading pauses for 10 minutes .
-- If Dow Industrials fall 25 points at opening , contract trading pauses for 10 minutes .
-- If S&P futures fall 12 points -LRB- equivalent to about 100 points on DJIA -RRB- , trading is frozen for half hour to that price or higher .
On NYSE program trades are diverted into a separate computer file to determine buy and sell orders .
-- If S&P futures fall 30 points , trading is restricted for an hour to that price or higher .
-- If Dow Industrials fall 250 points , trading on the Big Board halts for an hour .
S&P and MMI contracts also halt .
-- If DJIA drops 400 points , Big Board halts trading for two hours .
Trading in MMI and S&P futures also halted .
Brady Task Force recommendations -LRB- Jan. 1988 -RRB- :
-- Establish an overarching regulator for financial markets
-- Unify trade - clearing systems
-- Make margins consistent across stock and futures markets

Breaking the Soviet government 's television monopoly , an independent company has gained rights to show world programming , including American films .
`` There must not be a monopoly , there must be freedom of choice for both journalists and viewers , '' Nikolai I. Lutsenko , the president of the Nika TV company , told the weekly newspaper Nedelya .
The company is already working on its own programming in several provincial cities and hopes to be on the air regularly in about a year , the newspaper said .
Mr. Lutsenko told Nedelya that he recently had been to the U.S. to pick up the rights to show 5,000 U.S. films in the Soviet Union .
Nedelya 's article was accompanied by a picture of Mr. Lutsenko interviewing singer John Denver in Colorado .
Even though it will be independent of official television , Nika will have an oversight board that will include members of the Communist youth league .
South Africa 's National Union of Mineworkers said that about 10,000 diamond miners struck for higher wages at De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd.
De Beers said that workers at five of the group 's mines were on strike , which it said was peaceful , with orderly picketing occurring at one of the mines .
The deadlock in negotiations occurred with De Beers offering a 17 % increase in the minimum - wage category while the union demanded a 37.6 % increase in the minimum wage .
Japan 's opposition Socialist Party denied that its legislators had been bribed by pinball - parlor owners .
The allegation had been raised in Parliament by the governing Liberal Democratic Party following magazine reports suggesting that money from Japanese - style pinball , called pachinko , had infiltrated politics .
Tsuruo Yamaguchi , secretary general of the Socialist Party , acknowledged that nine party lawmakers had received donations from the pachinko association totaling 8 million yen -LRB- about $ 55,000 -RRB- but said the donations were legal and none of its members acted to favor the industry .
The World Wide Fund for Nature said that Spain , Argentina , Thailand and Indonesia were doing too little to prevent illegal trade in endangered wildlife across their borders .
A report by the conservation group presented at the U.N. - sponsored Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species in Lausanne accused the four of trading protected species ranging from parakeets to orchids .
Fund official Simon Lyster said world trade in wildlife was estimated to total $ 5 billion of business annually .
A NATO project to build a frigate for the 1990s was torpedoed by the pull - out of three of its eight participating nations .
Britain , France and Italy announced technical reasons for withdrawing , but some officials pointed to growing reluctance among the allies to commit themselves to big defense spending while East - West disarmament talks show signs of success .
Small wonder that Britain 's Labor Party wants credit controls .
A few hours after the party launched its own affinity credit card earlier this month , the Tories raised the nation 's base interest rate .
Labor 's Visa card is believed to be the first linked to a British political party .
Labor gets 25 pence -LRB- 39 cents -RRB- for every 100 -LRB- about $ 155 -RRB- that a user charges to the card .
As with other plastic in Britain 's high - interest - rate environment , the Labor card , administered by Co-operative Bank , carries a stiff -LRB- in this case , 29.8 % -RRB- annual rate on the unpaid balance .
China 's year - long austerity program has achieved some successes in harnessing runaway economic growth and stabilizing prices but has failed to eliminate serious defects in state planning and an alarming drain on state budgets .
The official China Daily said retail prices of non-staple foods have n't risen since last December but acknowledged that huge government subsidies were a main factor in keeping prices down .
The State Statistical Bureau found that more than 1 billion yuan -LRB- $ 270 million -RRB- was spent in the first half of the year for pork subsidies .
The newspaper quoted experts as saying the subsidies would cause the difference between prices and real values of commodities to `` become very unreasonable '' and reduce needed funds for investment in the `` already difficult state budget . ''
The aim of the austerity measures was to slice economic growth , which soared to 20.7 % last year , to 8 % in 1990 .
Economists now predict the growth rate will be about 11.5 % for the year .

Greece 's second bout of general elections this year is slated for Nov. 5 .
For those hoping to see a modicum of political normalcy restored -- in view of Greece 's eight - year misadventure under autocratic pseudosocialism and subsequent three - month hitch with a conservative - communist coalition government -- there is but one bright sign : The scandals still encircling former Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and his fallen socialist government are like flies buzzing around a rotting carcass .
In the mid-June round of voting , Greeks gave no clear mandate to any single political party .
The ad interim coalition government that emerged from post-electoral hagglings was , in essence , little more than the ill - conceived offspring of ideological miscegenation : On one side , the center - right New Democracy Party , headed by Constantine Mitsotakis .
On the other , the so - called Coalition of the Left and Progress -- a quaint and rather deceptive title for a merger of the pro-Soviet Communist Party of Greece and its Euro - Communist cousin , the Hellenic Left .
The unifying bond for this left - right mismatch was plain : PASOK -LRB- Mr. Papandreou 's party -RRB- as common political enemy .
The ostensible goal was a mop - up of government corruption , purportedly at all levels , but the main marks were Mr. Papandreou and his closest associates .
In point of fact , this catharsis was overdue by decades .
When reduced to buzzword status in ex parte pledges , however , the notion transmogrified into a promised assault , with targets primarily for political gains , not justice .
With regard to Greece 's long - bubbling bank - looting scandal , Mr. Papandreou 's principal accuser remains George Koskotas , former owner of the Bank of Crete and self - confessed embezzler , now residing in a jail cell in Salem , Mass. , from where he is fighting extradition proceedings that would return him to Greece .
Mr. Koskotas 's credibility is , at best , problematic .
He has ample motive to shift the blame , and his testimony has also been found less than forthright on numerous points .
Nevertheless , the New Democracy and Communist parties herald his assertions as proof of PASOK complicity .
Among unanswered questions are whether Mr. Papandreou received $ 23 million of stolen Bank of Crete funds and an additional $ 734,000 in bribes , as contended ; whether the prime minister ordered state agencies to deposit some $ 57 million in Mr. Koskotas 's bank and then skim off the interest ; and , what PASOK 's cut was from the $ 210 million Mr. Koskotas pinched .
Two former ministers were so heavily implicated in the Koskotas affair that PASOK members of Parliament voted to refer them to the special court .
But eluding parliamentary probe was the case of millions of drachmas Mr. Koskotas funneled into New Democracy coffers .
In the end , the investigation produced only circumstantial evidence and `` indications '' that point to PASOK , not clinching proof .
On another issue , Greeks were told how their national intelligence agency , the EYP , regularly monitored the telephone conversations of prominent figures , including key opposition politicians , journalists and PASOK cabinet members .
Despite convincing arguments , it was never established that Mr. Papandreou personally ordered or directed the wiretaps .
The central weakness of the `` scandals '' debates was pointed up especially well when discussions focused on arms deals and kickbacks .
The coalition government tried to show that PASOK ministers had received hefty sums for OKing the purchase of F - 16 Fighting Falcon and Mirage 2000 combat aircraft , produced by the U.S.based General Dynamics Corp. and France 's Avions Marcel Dassault , respectively .
Naturally , neither General Dynamics nor Dassault could be expected to hamper its prospective future dealings by making disclosures of sums paid -LRB- or not -RRB- to various Greek officials for services rendered .
So it seems that Mr. Mitsotakis and his communist chums may have unwittingly served Mr. Papandreou a moral victory on a platter : PASOK , whether guilty or not , can now traipse the countryside condemning the whole affair as a witch hunt at Mr. Papandreou 's expense .
But while verbal high jinks alone wo n't help PASOK regain power , Mr. Papandreou should never be underestimated .
First came his predictable fusillade : He charged the Coalition of the Left and Progress had sold out its leftist tenets by collaborating in a right - wing plot aimed at ousting PASOK and thwarting the course of socialism in Greece .
Then , to buttress his credibility with the left , he enticed some smaller leftist parties to stand for election under the PASOK banner .
Next , he continued to court the communists -- many of whom feel betrayed by the left - right coalition 's birth -- by bringing into PASOK a well - respected Communist Party candidate .
For balance , and in hopes of gaining some disaffected centrist votes , he managed to attract a former New Democracy Party representative and known political enemy of Mr. Mitsotakis .
Thus PASOK heads for the polls not only with diminished scandal - stench , but also with `` seals of approval '' from representatives of its harshest accusers .
Crucial as these elections are for Greece , pressing issues of state are getting lost in the shuffle .
The country 's future NATO participation remains unsure , for instance .
Greece also must revamp major pieces of legislation in preparation for the 1992 targets of heightened Common Market cooperation .
Greece 's bilateral relations with the U.S. need attention soon as well .
For one , the current accord concerning U.S. military bases in Greece lapses in May 1990 .
Negotiations for a new agreement were frozen before the June elections , but the clock is running .
Another matter of concern is the extradition of Mohammed Rashid , a Palestinian terrorist who is wanted in the U.S. for the 1982 bombing of a Pan American Airways flight .
The Greek courts have decided in favor of extradition in the Rashid case , but the matter awaits final approval from Greece 's next justice minister .
The Greeks seem barely aware of the importance of the case as a litmus test of whether Greece will be counted in or out for international efforts to combat terrorism .
That PASOK could win the elections outright is improbable ; the Greek press , previously eager to palm off PASOK 's line , has turned on Mr. Papandreou with a wild - eyed vengeance .
Yet the possibility of another lash - up government is all too real .
If Mr. Papandreou becomes the major opposition leader , he could hamstring a conservative - led coalition .
Also , he could force new elections early next year by frustrating the procedures for the election of the president of the republic in March .
New Democracy has once again glaringly underestimated the opponent and linked its own prospects to negative reaction against PASOK , forgetting to tend to either program clarity or the rectification of internal squabbles .
As for Mr. Papandreou ?
He 's not exactly sitting pretty at this stage .
But since he is undoubtedly one of the most proficient bull slingers who ever raked muck , it seems far wiser to view him as sidelined , but certainly not yet eliminated .
Mr. Carpenter , a regional correspondent for National Review , has lived in Athens since 1981 .
It was n't so long ago that a radio network funded by the U.S. Congress -- and originally by the Central Intelligence Agency -- was accused by officials here of employing propagandists , imperialists and spies .
Now , the network has opened a news bureau in the Hungarian capital .
Employees held an open house to celebrate and even hung out a sign : `` Szabad Europa Radio '' -- Radio Free Europe .
`` I think this is a victory for the radio , '' says Barnabas de Bueky , a 55 - year - old former Hungarian refugee who works in the Munich , West Germany , headquarters as deputy director of the Hungarian service .
In fact , the network hopes to set up offices in Warsaw and anywhere else in the East Bloc that will have it .
But the rapid changes brought on by glasnost and open borders are altering the network 's life in more ways than one .
In fact , Radio Free Europe is in danger of suffering from its success .
While the network currently can operate freely in Budapest , so can others .
In addition , competition for listeners is getting tougher in many ways than when broadcasting here was strictly controlled .
Instead of being denounced as an evil agent of imperialism , Radio Free Europe is more likely to draw the criticism that its programs are too tame , even boring .
`` They have a lot to do these days to compete with Hungarian radio , '' says Andrew Deak , a computer - science student at the Technical University in Budapest .
`` The Hungarian -LCB- radio -RCB- reporters seem better informed and more critical about about what 's going on here . ''
Indeed , Hungary is in the midst of a media explosion .
Boys on busy street corners peddle newspapers of every political stripe .
Newsstands are packed with a colorful array of magazines .
Radio and television are getting livelier and bolder .
The British Broadcasting Corp. and the U.S. State Department 's Voice of America broadcast over Hungarian airwaves , though only a few hours a day each in Hungarian .
Australian press magnate Rupert Murdoch has bought 50 % stakes in two popular and gossipy Hungarian newspapers , while Britain 's Robert Maxwell has let it be known here that he is thinking about similar moves .
But Radio Free Europe does n't plan to fade away .
With its mission for free speech and the capitalist way , the network 's staff says it still has plenty to do -- in Hungary and in the `` Great Eastern Beyond . ''
Radio Free Europe and its sister station for the Soviet Union , Radio Liberty , say they wo n't cut back their more than 19 hours of daily broadcasts .
They are still an important source of news for 60 million listeners in 23 exotic tongues : from Bulgarian and Belorussian to Kazakh and Kirghiz .
The establishment of its first bureau in Warsaw Pact territory shows the depth of some of the changes in Eastern Europe .
Months before the decision by the Hungarian Communist Party to rename itself Socialist and try to look more appealing to voters , the country 's rulers were trying to look more hospitable .
It proved a perfect time for Radio Free Europe to ask for permission to set up office .
Not only did the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs approve Radio Free Europe 's new location , but the Ministry of Telecommunications did something even more amazing : `` They found us four phone lines in central Budapest , '' says Geza Szocs , a Radio Free Europe correspondent who helped organize the Budapest location .
`` That is a miracle . ''
It 's a far cry from the previous treatment of the network , which had to overcome jamming of its frequencies and intimidation of local correspondents -LRB- who filed reports to the network by phone , secret messengers or letters -RRB- .
In fact , some of the network 's Hungarian listeners say they owe Radio Free Europe loyalty because it was responsible in many ways for keeping hope alive through what one writer here calls the `` Dark Ages of the 20th Century . ''
`` During the past four years , many of us have sat up until late at night listening to our radios , '' says the writer .
`` There were some very brave broadcasts . ''
The listeners , too , had to be brave .
Through much of the post-World War II period , listening to Western broadcasts was a crime in Hungary .
`` When we listen to the Europe station , my mother still gets nervous , '' says a Budapest translator .
`` She wants to turn down the volume and close the curtains . ''
Now , the toughest competition for Radio Free Europe comes during the late - night slot .
Hungarian radio often saves its most politically outspoken broadcasts for around midnight .
Television , which most of the time is considered rather tame , has entered the running with a new program , `` The End of the Day , '' which comes on after 11 p.m .
It is a talk show with opposition leaders and political experts who discuss Hungary 's domestic problems as well as foreign affairs .
Those who want to hear even more radical views have to get up at five on Sunday morning for `` Sunday Journal , '' on Hungarian Radio .
The competitive spirit is clearly influencing Radio Free Europe , which is trying to beef up programs .
The Budapest office plans to hire free - lance reporters to cover the latest happenings in Hungarian country towns from Nagykanizsa in the west to Nyiregyhaza in the east .
The Hungarian service has a daily 40 - minute news show called Newsreel , with international and domestic news , plus a daily news review of opinions from around the world .
There 's also a host of new programs , trying to lighten up on the traditional diet of politics .
A daily 35 - minute program called `` The March of Time '' tries to find interesting tidbits of lighthearted news and gossip from around the world .
There 's a program for women and a science show .
And to attract younger listeners , Radio Free Europe intersperses the latest in Western rock groups .
The Pet Shop Boys are big this year in Budapest .
`` We are starving for all the news , '' says Mr. Deak , the student .
`` Every moment we want to know everything about the world .
The market for $ 200 billion of high - risk junk bonds , battered by a succession of defaults and huge price declines this year , practically vanished Friday .
Trading ground to a halt as investors rushed to sell bonds , only to find themselves deserted by potential buyers .
Stunned , they watched brokerage houses mark down price quotations on their junk holdings while being able to execute very few actual trades .
`` The junk bond market is in a state of gridlock now -- there are no bids , only offers , '' says independent investor Martin D. Sass , who manages nearly $ 4 billion and who recently decided to buy distressed securities for a new fund .
This calamity is `` far from over , '' he says .
Junk 's collapse helped stoke the panicky selling of stocks that produced the deepest one - day dive in the Dow Jones Industrial Average since the Oct. 19 , 1987 , crash .
Simultaneously , it also helped trigger this year 's biggest rally in the U.S. government bond market as investors rushed to move capital into the highest - quality securities they could find .
But `` an eerie silence pervaded '' the junk market Friday as prices tumbled on hundreds of high - yield bonds despite `` no active trading , '' says John Lonski , an economist at Moody 's Investors Service Inc .
For example , the price of Southland Corp. 's $ 500 million of 16 3/4 % bonds due 2002 -- sold less than two years ago by Goldman , Sachs & Co. -- plummeted 25 % to just 30 cents on the dollar .
But not even Goldman would make a market in the securities of Southland , the owner of the nationwide chain of 7 - 11 convenience stores that is strapped for cash .
Goldman officials declined to comment .
Junk bonds , which mushroomed from less than $ 2 billion at the start of this decade , have been declining for months as issuer after issuer sank beneath the weight of hefty interest payments .
The shaky market received its biggest jolt last month from Campeau Corp. , which created its U.S. retailing empire with junk financing .
Campeau developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be tardy on some interest payments and to put its prestigious Bloomingdales department - store chain up for sale .
Now , dozens of corporations , including Ethan Allen , TW Services and York International , that are counting on at least $ 7 billion of scheduled new junk financings to keep their highly leveraged takeovers and buy - outs afloat , may never get the money .
`` The music has stopped playing , '' says Michael Harkins , a principal in the investment firm of Levy Harkins .
`` You 've either got a chair or you do n't . ''
In Friday 's aftermath , says R. Douglas Carleton , a director of high - yield finance at First Boston Corp. , `` much of the $ 7 billion forward calendar could be deferred , depending on the hysteria . ''
In August , First Boston withdrew a $ 475 million junk offering of Ohio Mattress bonds because potential buyers were `` very skittish . ''
The outlook `` looks shaky because we 're still waiting '' for mutual funds , in particular , to dump some of their junk bond holdings to pay off redemptions by individual investors , says King Penniman , senior vice president at McCarthy , Crisanti & Maffei , an investment arm of Xerox Financial Services .
Indeed , a Moody 's index that tracks the net asset values of 24 high - yield mutual funds declined for the 17th consecutive day Friday .
In a stark contrast , the benchmark 30 - year Treasury bond climbed more than 2 1/2 points , or about $ 25 for each $ 1,000 face amount , to 103 12/32 , its biggest gain of the year .
The bond 's yield dropped to 7.82 % , the lowest since March 31 , 1987 , according to Technical Data Global Markets Group .
The yield on three - month Treasury bills , considered the safest of all investments , plummeted about 0.7 percentage point to 7.16 % , the largest one - day decline since 1982 .
The main catalyst for government bond market rally was the 190.58 - point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
`` When you get panic in one market , you get flight to quality in the other , '' said Maria Ramirez , money market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc .
Nevertheless , the problems of the junk market could prompt the Federal Reserve to ease credit in the months ahead .
`` This marks a significant shift in the interest rate outlook , '' says William Sullivan , director of money market research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. , New York .
Any sustained credit - easing could be a lift for junk bonds as well as other securities .
Robert Dow , a partner and portfolio manager at Lord , Abbett & Co. , which manages $ 4 billion of high - yield bonds , says he does n't `` think there is any fundamental economic rationale -LCB- for the junk bond rout -RCB- .
It was herd instinct . ''
He adds : `` The junk market has witnessed some trouble and now some people think that if the equity market gets creamed that means the economy will be terrible and that 's bad for junk .
I do n't believe that 's the case , but I believe that people are running scared .
There is a flight to quality , and the quality is not in equities and not in junk -- it 's in Treasurys . ''
Even as trading in high - yield issues dried up over the past month , corporations sold more than $ 2 billion of new junk bonds .
For example , a recent $ 375 million offering of Petrolane Gas Services L.P. bonds sold by First Boston was three times oversubscribed .
A $ 550 million offering of Turner Broadcasting System Inc . high - yield securities sold last week by Drexel was increased $ 50 million because of strong demand .
First Boston estimates that in November and December alone , junk bond investors will receive $ 4.8 billion of coupon interest payments .
`` That 's a clear indication that there is and will be an undercurrent of basic business going on , '' says Mr. Carleton of First Boston .
`` I do n't know how people can say the junk bond market disappeared when there were $ 1.5 billion of orders for $ 550 million of junk bonds sold last week by Turner , '' says Raymond Minella , co-head of merchant banking at Merrill Lynch & Co .
`` When the rally comes , insurance companies will be leading it because they have billions to invest and invest they will .
There is plenty of money available from people who want to buy well - structured deals ; it 's the stuff that 's financed on a shoestring that people are wary of . ''
But such highly leveraged transactions seemed to have multiplied this year , casting a pall over much of the junk market .
Michael McNamara , director of fixed - income research at Kemper Financial Services , says the quality of junk issues has been getting poorer , contributing to the slide in prices .
`` Last year we probably bought one out of every three new deals , '' he says .
`` This year , at best , it 's in one in every five or six .
And our credit standards have n't changed one iota . ''
However , Mr. McNamara said the slide in junk is creating `` one hell of a buying opportunity '' for selective buyers .
For the moment , investors seem more preoccupied with the `` bad '' junk than the `` good '' junk .
`` The market has been weak since '' the announcement of the Campeau cash squeeze and the company 's subsequent bailout by Olympia & York , says Mr. Minella of Merrill Lynch .
`` That really affected the market in that people started to ask ` What else is in trouble ? ' ''
Well before Campeau , though , there were signs that the junk market was stumbling through one of its worst years ever .
Despite the relatively strong economy , junk bond prices did nothing except go down , hammered by a seemingly endless trail of bad news :
-- In June , two months before it would default on interest payments covering some of its $ 1.2 billion of speculative debt securities , New York - based Integrated Resources Inc. said it ran out of borrowed money .
-- In July , Southmark Corp. , the Dallas - based real estate and financial services company with about $ 1.3 billion of junk bonds , voluntarily filed for protection under U.S. bankruptcy law .
-- By the end of July , the difference in yield between an index of junk bonds and seven - year Treasury notes widened to more than 5.5 percentage points .
-- In August , Resorts International Inc. , which sold more than $ 500 million of junk bonds , suspended interest payments .
-- In September , just as the cash squeeze hit Campeau , Lomas Financial Corp. defaulted on $ 145 million of notes and appeared unlikely to pay interest on a total of $ 1.2 billion of debt securities .
Meantime , regulators are becoming increasingly worried as the rush to leverage shows no signs of abating .
Moody 's says the frequency of corporate credit downgrades is the highest this year since 1982 .
In addition , there are six times as many troubled banks as there were in the recession of 1981 , according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .
`` The era of the 1980s is about compound interest and the reaching for it , '' says James Grant , editor of Grant 's Interest Rate Observer , an early critic of the junk bond market .
`` What we 've begun to see is the damage to businesses of paying exorbitant compound interest .
Businesses were borrowing at interest rates higher than their own earnings .
What we 're seeing now is the wrenching readjustment of asset values to a future when speculative - grade debt will be hard to obtain rather than easy . ''
Friday 's Market Activity
Prices of Treasury bonds surged in the biggest rally of the year as investors fled a plummeting stock market .
The benchmark 30 - year Treasury bond was quoted 6 p.m. EDT at 103 12/32 , compared with 100 27/32 Thursday , up 2 1/2 points .
The yield on the benchmark fell to 7.82 % , the lowest since March 31 , 1987 , according to Technical Data Global Markets Group .
The `` flight to quality '' began late in the day and followed a precipitous fall in the stock market .
Treasurys opened lower , reacting negatively to news that the producer price index -- a measure of inflation on the wholesale level -- accelerated in September .
Bond prices barely budged until midday .
Many bond market participants will be closely eying the action of the Federal Reserve , which might repeat its October 1987 injection of huge amounts of liquidity to buoy the financial markets and keep the economy from slowing into a recession .
Prices of municipals , investment - grade corporates and mortgage - backed bonds also rose , but lagged behind their Treasury counterparts .
Mortgage securities rose in hectic trading , with most of the activity concentrated in Government National Mortgage Association 9 % coupon securities , the most liquid mortgage issue .
The Ginnie Mae November 9 % issue ended at 98 25/32 , up 7/8 point on the day , to yield about 9.28 % to a 12 - year average life assumption .
Investment - grade corporate bonds were up about 1/2 to 3/4 point .
But the yield spread between lower - quality , investment - grade issues and higher - quality bonds widened .
And the yields on telephone and utility issues rose relative to other investment - grade bonds in anticipation of this week 's $ 3 billion bond offering by the Tennessee Valley Authority .
Despite rumors that the TVA 's long - awaited offering would be postponed because of the debacle in the equity markets , sources in the underwriting syndicate said they expect the issue will be priced as scheduled .
One of the sources said the smaller portions of $ 750 million each of five - year and 10 - year bonds have already been `` substantially oversubscribed . ''
Municipal bonds rose as much as 3/4 point .

Axa - Midi Assurances of France gave details of its financing plans for its proposed $ 4.5 billion acquisition of Farmers Group Inc. , in amended filings with insurance regulators in the nine U.S. states where Farmers operates .
The proposed acquisition is part of Sir James Goldsmith 's unfriendly takeover attempt for B.A.T Industries PLC , the British tobacco , retailing , paper and financial services concern that is parent of Los Angeles - based Farmers .
In an attempt to appease U.S. regulators ' concern over a Goldsmith acquisition of Farmers , Sir James in August agreed to sell Farmers to Axa if he is successful in acquiring B.A.T .
As part of the agreement , Axa agreed to invest $ 1 billion in Hoylake Investments Ltd. , Sir James 's acquisition vehicle .
Of the total $ 5.5 billion to be paid to Hoylake by Axa , about $ 1 billion will come from available resources of Axa 's parent , Axa - Midi Group , $ 2.25 billion will be in the form of notes issued by Axa , and the remaining $ 2.25 billion will be in long - term bank loans .
In an interview Thursday , Claude Bebear , chairman and chief executive officer of Axa , said his group has already obtained assurances from a group of banks led by Cie . Financiere de Paribas that they can provide the loan portion of the financing .
The other banking companies in the group are Credit Lyonnais , Societe Generale , BankAmerica Corp. and Citicorp , he said .
Mr. Bebear said Axa - Midi Group has `` more than $ 2.5 billion of non-strategic assets that we can and will sell '' to help pay off debt from the acquisition .
He said the assets to be sold would be `` non-insurance '' assets , including a beer company and a real estate firm , and would n't include any pieces of Farmers .
`` We wo n't put any burden on Farmers , '' he said .
The amended filings also point out that under a new agreement , Hoylake has an absolute obligation to sell Farmers to Axa upon an acquisition of B.A.T .
`` We hope that with what we did , the regulators will not need to evaluate Hoylake , and they can directly look at the agreement with us , because Hoylake wo n't be an owner of Farmers at anytime , '' Mr. Bebear said .
Any change of control in Farmers needs approval of the insurance commissioners in the nine states where Farmers and its related companies are incorporated .
The amended filings were required because of the new agreement between Axa and Hoylake , and to reflect the extension that Sir James received last month under British takeover rules to complete his proposed acquisition .
Hoylake dropped its initial # 13.35 billion -LRB- $ 20.71 billion -RRB- takeover bid after it received the extension , but said it would launch a new bid if and when the propsed sale of Farmers to Axa receives regulatory approval .
A spokesman for B.A.T said of the amended filings that , `` It would appear that nothing substantive has changed .
The new financing structure is still a very - highly leveraged one , and Axa still plans to take out 75 % of Farmers ' earnings as dividends to service their debt . ''
That dividend is almost double the 35 % currently taken out of Farmers by B.A.T , the spokesman added .
`` It would have severe implications for Farmers ' policy holders . ''
To fend off Sir James 's advances , B.A.T has proposed a sweeping restructuring that would pare it to a tobacco and financial services concern .
Apple Computer Inc. said it will offer cash rebates on several of its machines from Oct. 14 to Dec. 31. , as part of a holiday - season sales promotion .
Apple will offer a $ 150 rebate on its Apple IIGS with any Apple Monitor and disk drive ; $ 200 on the basic Macintosh Plus central processing unit ; $ 250 on the Macintosh SE central processing unit ; $ 250 on the Macintosh SE / 30 cpu , and $ 300 on a Macintosh IIcx with any Apple video card and Apple monitor .
The rebates , as a percentage of the retail cost of the cpu of each system , amount to 6 % to 13 % .
The company is also offering a free trial of its computers to consumers who qualify for its credit cards or leases .
The state - controlled insurer Assurances Generales de France said it has obtained regulatory approval to increase its stake in the financial holding company Cie. de Navigation Mixte above 10 % from the current level of about 8 % .
Friday 's approval was needed to conform with Bourse rules regarding companies with bank interests and follows a similar approval given Wednesday to Cie . Financiere de Paribas .
Both Paribas and AGF have been increasing their stakes in Navigation Mixte recently for what they have termed `` investment purposes , '' although the issue has been surrounded by takeover speculation in recent weeks .
AGF did n't comment officially on its reasons for seeking the approval , but people close to the group said it was done to make sure the group would have the flexibility to increase its stake in the future , should interesting price opportunities arise .
An AGF official did specify , however , that there was no foundation to recent rumors the group might be acting in concert with Paribas .
The debate over National Service has begun again .
After a decade in which more than 50 localities established their own service or conservation corps and dozens of school systems made community service a prerequisite to high - school graduation , the focus has shifted to Washington .
At least 10 bills proposing one or another national program were introduced in Congress this spring .
One , co-sponsored by Sen. Sam Nunn -LRB- D. , Ga . -RRB- and Rep. Dave McCurdy -LRB- D. , Okla. -RRB- , would have restricted federal college subsidies to students who had served .
An omnibus bill assembled by Sen. Edward Kennedy -LRB- D. , Mass. -RRB- , and including some diluted Nunn - McCurdy provisions along with proposals by fellow Democratic Sens. Claiborne Pell , Barbara Mikulski and Christopher Dodd , has been reported out of the Senate Labor Committee .
It might well win Senate passage .
President Bush has outlined his own Youth Entering Service -LRB- YES -RRB- plan , though its details remain to be specified .
What is one to think of all this ?
Doctrine and special interests govern some responses .
People eager to have youth `` pay their dues to society '' favor service proposals -- preferably mandatory ones .
So do those who seek a `` re-energized concept of citizenship , '' a concept imposing stern obligations as well as conferring rights .
Then there are instinctive opponents .
To libertarians , mandatory service is an abomination and voluntary systems are illegitimate uses of tax money .
Devotees of the market question the value of the work national service would perform :
If the market wo n't pay for it , they argue , it ca n't be worth its cost .
Elements of the left are also reflexively opposed ; they see service as a cover for the draft , or fear the regimentation of youth , or want to see rights enlarged , not obligations .
But what about those of us whose views are not predetermined by formula or ideology ?
How should we think about national service ?
Let 's begin by recognizing a main source of confusion -- `` national service '' has no agreed meaning .
Would service be voluntary or compulsory ?
Short or long ?
Part - time or full - time ?
Paid or unpaid ?
Would participants live at home and work nearby or live in barracks and work on public lands ?
What kinds of work would they do ?
What does `` national '' mean ?
Would the program be run by the federal government , by local governments , or by private voluntary organizations ?
And who would serve ?
Only males , as with the draft , or both sexes ?
Youth only or all ages ?
Middle - class people , or poor people , or a genuine cross-section ?
Many or few ?
Those are not trivial questions , and the label `` national service '' answers none of them .
Then how should we think about national service ?
As a starting point , here are five propositions : 1 . Consider the ingredients , not the name .
Ignore `` national service '' in the abstract ; consider specific proposals .
They will differ in crucial ways .
2 . `` Service '' should be service .
As commonly understood , service implies sacrifice .
It involves accepting risk , or giving up income , or deferring a career .
It follows that proposals like Nunn - McCurdy , whose benefits to enrollees are worth some $ 17,500 a year , do not qualify .
There is a rationale for such bills : Federal subsidies to college students amount to `` a GI Bill without the GI '' ; arguably those benefits should be earned , not given .
But the earnings exceed by 20 % the average income of young high - school graduates with full - time jobs .
Why call that service ?
3 . Encouragement is fine ; compulsion is not .
Compelled service is unconstitutional .
It is also unwise and unenforceable .
-LRB- Who will throw several hundred thousand refusers in jail each year ? -RRB-
But through tax policy and in other ways the federal government encourages many kinds of behavior .
It should also encourage service -- preferably by all classes and all ages .
Its encouragement should strengthen and not undercut the strong tradition of volunteering in the U.S. , should build on the service programs already in existence , and should honor local convictions about which tasks most need doing .
4 . Good programs are not cheap .
Enthusiasts assume that national service would get important work done cheaply : forest fires fought , housing rehabilitated , students tutored , day - care centers staffed .
There is important work to be done , and existing service and conservation corps have shown that even youths who start with few skills can do much of it well -- but not cheaply .
Good service programs require recruitment , screening , training and supervision -- all of high quality .
They involve stipends to participants .
Full - time residential programs also require housing and full - time supervision ; they are particularly expensive -- more per participant than a year at Stanford or Yale .
Non-residential programs are cheaper , but good ones still come to some $ 10,000 a year .
Are they worth that ?
Evaluations suggest that good ones are -- especially so if the effects on participants are counted .
But the calculations are challengeable .
5 . Underclass youth are a special concern .
Are such expenditures worthwhile , then ?
Yes , if targeted .
People of all ages and all classes should be encouraged to serve , but there are many ways for middle - class kids , and their elders , to serve at little public cost .
They can volunteer at any of thousands of non-profit institutions , or participate in service programs required by high schools or encouraged by colleges or employers .
Underclass youth do n't have those opportunities .
They are not enrolled in high school or college .
They are unlikely to be employed .
And they have grown up in unprecedentedly grim circumstances , among family structures breaking down , surrounded by self - destructive behaviors and bleak prospects .
But many of them can be quite profoundly reoriented by productive and disciplined service .
Some wo n't accept the discipline ; others drop out for other reasons .
But some whom nothing else is reaching are transformed .
Learning skills , producing something cooperatively , feeling useful , they are no longer dependent -- others now depend on them .
Even if it is cheaper to build playgrounds or paint apartments or plant dune - grass with paid professionals , the effects on the young people providing those services alter the calculation .
Strictly speaking , these youth are not performing service .
They are giving up no income , deferring no careers , incurring no risk .
But they believe themselves to be serving , and they begin to respect themselves -LRB- and others -RRB- , to take control of their lives , to think of the future .
That is a service to the nation .
It is what federal support should try hardest to achieve .

Trinity Industries Inc. said it reached a preliminary agreement to manufacture 1,000 coal rail cars for Norfolk Southern Corp .
Trinity estimated the value of the pact at more than $ 40 million .
Trinity said it plans to begin delivery of the rail cars in the first quarter of 1990 .
It said the 1,000 rail cars are in addition to the 1,450 coal rail cars presently being produced for Norfolk Southern , a Norfolk , Va. - based railroad concern .
Freeport - McMoRan Inc. said a temporary cessation of operations at its Sunshine Bridge uranium - recovery facility in Donaldsonville , La. , will result in slight earnings improvement to both the company and its Freeport - McMoRan Resource Partners Limited Partnership unit .
The company did n't elaborate .
The diversified energy and minerals concern said that a depressed uranium market is responsible for the temporary mothballing of the plant , but that the plant can be reactivated quickly when the market improves .
More than 400,000 pounds of uranium a year have been produced at the facility during the past seven years .
A second uranium - recovery plant at Uncle Sam , La. , that produces more than 700,000 pounds of uranium annually , will continue to operate .
Freeport - McMoRan said the shutdown wo n't affect sales volumes under long - term sales contracts of its Freeport Uranium Recovery Co. unit , but will reduce the amount of product sold on the spot market .
Freeport - McMoRan Resource Partners , as owner of the uranium - recovery technology , receives royalty payments .
A UNIFIED EUROPE poses labor problems and prospects for U.S. firms .
The `` social dimension '' -- worker concerns -- of the European Community 's plan to open its internal borders in 1992 could set the effort `` off the rails '' if not done reasonably , says General Electric senior vice president Frank Doyle .
U.S. companies wanting to expand in Europe face `` tough pressure '' from unions in nations such as West Germany , which play a big consulting role in management decisions , he says .
FMC Corp. and Baxter International say unions also wo n't like plant relocations and needed restructuring , which means layoffs .
Many employers have already begun moving to southern countries such as Spain and Italy , where wages are low and unions are weaker ; demand for trained labor and managers will rise there , FMC says .

CLUBBING A FAN was n't the Baltimore Orioles ' fault .
So said a federal judge , in a case involving two players for the minor league Bluefield , Va. , Orioles , a Baltimore farm team .
The players were heckled by a patron during a July 4 , 1988 , game with the Martinsville Phillies .
Like its parent that year , `` Bluefield was not having a good year , '' the judge said .
After the game -LRB- `` Bluefield lost , 9 - 8 , stranding three runners in ... the ninth , '' he noted -RRB- , trouble began .
More taunting in the parking lot , the players said , led to a fight .
The fan said he was punched and kicked by one player and that the other broke his jaw with a baseball bat .
The judge dismissed the fan 's suit against the team , however , ruling the Orioles innocent of negligent hiring , and not responsible for a fight that was outside the players ' employment .
PROPOSALS ARISE for coping with the shortage of nurses .
An Association of Academic Health Centers report urges freeing nurses from duties that do n't require special skills .
It also recommends better retirement and day - care benefits , and basing pay on education , experience and nurses ' demanding work schedules .
But it opposes an American Medical Association proposal for creating a `` registered care technologist , '' as `` potentially divisive '' ; it says the job would entail an unwanted new doctor 's `` bedside '' extension .
Over a third of 618 hospitals surveyed by consultant Hewitt Associates use a `` clinical ladder , '' basing advancement on performance and education .

U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said the first dispute - settlement panel set up under the U.S. - Canadian `` free trade '' agreement has ruled that Canada 's restrictions on exports of Pacific salmon and herring violate the accord .
Mrs. Hills said the U.S. and Canada have until Nov. 13 to resolve the dispute .
If a solution is n't reached by then , she said , the U.S. would have the right to suspend some trade concessions to Canada equivalent in value to the losses suffered by U.S. fish - processing companies in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest .
However , in Ottawa , Canadian Trade Minister John Crosbie said the dispute - settlement panel accepted the `` legitimacy of Canada 's position on the use of these landing requirements to conserve and manage these important fisheries . ''
Questioned about the seeming contradiction in the U.S. and Canadian government views of the panel 's report , an aide for Mrs. Hills said the panel had clearly ruled that the Canadian trade restrictions `` are illegal . ''
The U.S. trade representative declined to put a dollar estimate on the losses resulting from the Canadian export restrictions .
Canada initially had an export prohibition that was replaced by regulations requiring that such fish had to be brought ashore in British Columbia by commercial fishermen prior to export .
This action was defended by the Canadian government on conservation grounds .
Mrs. Hills said yesterday that the dispute - settlement panel rejected this Canadian government argument .
`` We fully expect that Canada will comply with the panel 's ruling '' that the `` landing requirement '' also must be ended , she said .
Earlier , an international panel set up under the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva determined that the original Canadian fish - export restrictions violated GATT rules .
Mrs. Hills said the U.S. wo n't accept any delays after Nov. 13 because U.S. fish - processing firms enter into contracts in the fall to purchase the next season 's catch .
She said the Canadian restrictions must be removed before such contracts are concluded .
Laidlaw Transportation Ltd. said it raised its stake in ADT Ltd. of Bermuda to 29.4 % from 28 % .
A spokesman for Laidlaw declined to disclose the price the Toronto transportation and waste services concern paid for the additional shares , which he said were acquired `` over the last couple of weeks . ''
The spokesman said Laidlaw would n't increase its stake in ADT beyond 30 % `` without a great deal of thought '' because of British takeover regulations that require a company acquiring more than 30 % to extend an offer to the rest of the company 's shareholders .
ADT , a security services and auctions company , trades on London 's Stock Exchange .
Laidlaw is 47%-controlled by Canadian Pacific Ltd. , a Montreal transportation , resources and industrial holding concern .
For the moment , at least , euphoria has replaced anxiety on Wall Street .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped sharply yesterday to close at 2657.38 , panic did n't sweep the world 's markets , and investors large and small seemed to accept Friday 's dizzying 190 - point plunge as a sharp correction , not a calamity .
Many went bargain - hunting .
Among those sighing with relief was John H. Gutfreund , chairman of Salomon Brothers , who took to the firm 's trading floor to monitor yesterday 's events .
As the rally gained strength at 3:15 p.m. , he smiled broadly , brandished his unlit cigar and slapped Stanley Shopkorn , his top stock trader , on the back .
At first , it seemed as if history might repeat itself .
As trading opened yesterday morning on the Big Board , stocks of many of the nation 's biggest companies could n't open for trading because a wave of sell orders was overwhelming buyers .
By 10:10 , the Dow Industrials were off 63.52 points , and the stock of UAL Corp. , whose troubles had kicked off Friday 's plunge , still had n't opened .
But then , as quickly as the Dow had fallen , it began to turn around .
It ended with a gain of 88.12 points .
By the market 's close , volume on the New York exchange totaled more than 416 million , the fourth highest on record .
The Big Board handled the huge volume without any obvious strain , in sharp contrast to Black Monday of 1987 .
But the rally was largely confined to the blue - chip stocks , which had been hard hit during Friday 's selling frenzy .
Overall , more Big Board stocks lost money than gained .
And many arbitragers , already reeling from Friday 's collapse of the UAL deal , were further hurt yesterday when a proposed takeover of AMR Corp. , the parent of American Airlines , collapsed .
Indeed , the Dow Jones Transportation Average plunged 102.06 points , its second - worst drop in history .
World - wide , trading was generally manageable .
The Frankfurt stock exchange was hardest hit of the major markets , with blue chips there falling 12.8 % .
In London , a midday rally left the market 's major index off 3.2 % , and Tokyo 's leading stock index fell only 1.8 % in surprisingly lackluster trading .
Other , more thinly traded Asian markets were hit harder than Tokyo 's , but there were no free - fall declines .
Investors big and small say they learned valuable lessons since the 1987 crash : In this age of computerized trading , huge corrections or runups in a few hours ' time must be expected .
What 's more , such short - term cataclysms are survivable and are no cause for panic selling .
Stephen Boesel , a major money manager for T. Rowe Price in Baltimore , says , `` There was less panic than in 1987 : We had been through it once . ''
In Somerset , Wis. , Adrian Sween , who owns a supplier of nursing - home equipment and is n't active in the stock market , agrees .
`` I look at it as a ho - hum matter , '' he says .
Many other factors played a part in yesterday 's comeback .
The Federal Reserve signaled its willingness to provide liquidity ; the interest rate on its loans to major banks inched downward early in the day .
Foreign stock markets , which kicked off Black Monday with a huge selling spree , began the day off by relatively modest amounts .
The dollar , after falling sharply in overnight trading to 139.10 yen , bounced back strongly to 141.8 , thus easing fears that foreigners would unload U.S. stocks .
And the widely disseminated opinion among most market experts that a crash was n't in store also helped calm investors .
Many major institutions , for example , came into work yesterday ready to buy some of the blue chips they felt had been sharply undervalued on Friday .
Still , amid all the backslapping and signs of relief over yesterday 's events , some market professionals cautioned that there is nothing present in the current market system to prevent another dizzying drop such as Friday 's .
`` There is too much complacency , '' says money manager Barry Schrager .
Computers have increasingly connected securities markets world - wide , so that a buying or selling wave in one market is often passed around the globe .
So investors everywhere nervously eyed yesterday 's opening in Tokyo , where the Nikkei average of 225 blue - chip stocks got off to a rocky start .
The average plunged some 600 points , or 1.7 % , in the first 20 minutes of trading .
But the selling wave had no conviction , and the market first surged upward by 200 points , then drifted lower , closing down 647 .
Unlike two years ago , most of Japan 's major investors chose to sit this calamity out .
In Merrill Lynch & Co. 's Tokyo trading room , some 40 traders and assistants sat quietly , with few orders to process .
Clients `` are all staying out '' of the market , one Merrill trader says .
The relative calm in Tokyo proved little comfort to markets opening up in Europe .
Frankfurt 's opening was delayed a half hour because of a crush of sell orders .
`` The beginning was chaotic , '' says Nigel Longley , a broker for Commerzbank
In London , the view from the trading floor of an American securities firm , Jefferies & Co. , also was troubling .

`` I see concern , but I do n't see panic , '' says J. Francis Palamara , a New Yorker who runs the 15 - trader office .
London 's blue - chip stock index turned up just before 8 a.m . New York time , sending an encouraging message to Wall Street .
When trading opened in New York at 9:30 a.m. EDT , stocks fell sharply -- as expected .
Futures markets in Chicago had opened at a level suggesting the Dow would fall by about 60 points .
With sell orders piled up from Friday , about half the stocks in the Dow could n't open on time .
By 9:45 , the industrial average had dropped 27 points .
By 10 a.m. , it was down 49 .
Ten minutes later , the Dow hit bottom - down 63.52 points , another 2.5 % .
But shortly before then , some of Wall Street 's sharpest traders say , they sensed a turn .
`` The first thing that caught my eye that was encouraging was Treasury bonds were off , '' says Austin George , head of stock trading at T. Rowe Price .
`` It meant that people were n't running pell - mell to the safety of bonds . ''
Shortly after 10 a.m. , the Major Market Index , a Chicago Board of Trade futures contract of 20 stocks designed to mimic the DJIA , exploded upward .
Stock traders were buoyed -- because an upturn in the MMI had also started the recovery in stocks on the Tuesday following Black Monday .
`` The MMI has gone better , '' shouted a trader in the London office of Shearson Lehman Hutton .
Shearson 's London trading room went wild .
Traders shouted out as their Reuters , Quotron and Telerate screens posted an ever - narrowing loss on Wall Street .
Then , nine minutes later , Wall Street suddenly rebounded to a gain on the day .
`` Rally , rally , rally , '' shouted Shearson 's Andy Rosen .
`` This is panic buying . ''
Major blue - chip stocks like Philip Morris , General Motors and Proctor & Gamble led the rally .
Japanese were said to be heavy buyers .
German and Dutch investors reportedly loaded up on Kellogg Co .
Then , traders say , corporations with share buy - back programs kicked into high gear , triggering gains in , among other issues , Alcan Aluminium and McDonald 's .
Walt Disney Co. , which had one of the biggest sell - order imbalances on Friday and was one of seven stocks that halted trading and never reopened that day , opened yesterday late at 114.5 , down 8.5 .
But then it suddenly burst upward 7.5 as Goldman , Sachs & Co. stepped in and bought almost every share offer , traders said .
By 10:25 , the Dow had turned up for the day , prompting cheers on trading desks and exchange floors .
Among Big Board specialists , the cry was `` Pull your offers '' -- meaning that specialists soon expected to get higher prices for their shares .
`` It was bedlam on the upside , '' said one Big Board specialist .
`` What we had was a real , old - fashioned rally . ''
This technical strength spurred buying from Wall Street 's `` black boxes , '' computer programs designed to trigger large stock purchases during bullish periods .
Typical , perhaps , was Batterymarch 's Dean LeBaron .
Mr. LeBaron , who manages $ 10 billion , says , `` We turned the trading system on , and it did whatever it was programmed to do . ''
Asked what stocks the computer bought , the money manager says , `` I do n't know . ''
Not everybody was making money .
The carnage on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , the nation 's major options market , was heavy after the trading in S&P 100 stock - index options was halted Friday .
Many market makers in the S&P 100 index options contract had bullish positions Friday , and when the shutdown came they were frozen with huge losses .
Over the weekend , clearing firms told the Chicago market makers to get out of their positions at any cost Monday morning .
`` They were absolutely killed , slaughtered , '' said one Chicago - based options trader .
Meanwhile , a test of the stock market 's rally came at about 2 p.m. , with the Dow at 2600 , up 31 points on the day .
Charles Clough , a strategist at Merrill Lynch , says bargain hunting had explained the Dow 's strength up to that point and that many market professionals were anticipating a drop in the Dow .
Moreover , the announcement that real estate magnate and sometime raider Donald Trump was withdrawing his offer for AMR Corp. might have been expected to rattle traders .
Instead , the rally only paused for about 25 minutes and then steamed forward as institutions resumed buying .
The market closed minutes after reaching its high for the day of
Across the country , many people took yesterday 's events in stride , while remaining generally uneasy about the stock market in general .
Says James Norman , the mayor of Ava , Mo. : `` I do n't invest in stocks .
I much prefer money I can put my hands on . ''
While Mayor Norman found the market 's performance Monday reassuring , he says , he remains uneasy .
`` We have half the experts saying one thing and half the other '' about the course of the economy .
Ralph Holzfaster , a farmer and farm - supply store operator in Ogallala , Neb. , says of the last few days events , `` If anything good comes out of this , it might be that it puts some of these LBOs on the skids . ''
Says Gordon Fines , a money manager at IDS Financial Services in Minneapolis , `` You 're on a roller coaster , and that may last .
The public is still cautious .
In a possible prelude to the resumption of talks between Boeing Co. and striking Machinists union members , a federal mediator said representatives of the two sides will meet with him tomorrow .
`` It could be a long meeting or it could be a short one , '' said Doug Hammond , the mediator , who called the agreement to meet a first step toward a resumption of negotiations .
`` We 're encouraged that talks are scheduled again but beyond that , we have made no expression of expectations , '' a Boeing spokesman said .
The Machinists union has rejected a three - year contract offer that would have provided a 10 % wage increase over the life of the pact , plus some bonuses .
Currently , average pay for machinists is $ 13.39 an hour , Boeing said .
Now in its 13th day , the strike has idled about 55,000 machinists and has started to delay delivery of some jetliners .
With a strike fund of about $ 100 million , the union had said it was prepared for a long strike .
After the third week on strike , union members will begin receiving $ 100 a week from the fund .
Work at Boeing continues with supervisors and other non-striking personnel manning the lines .
And at the company 's Wichita , Kan. , plant , about 2,400 of the 11,700 machinists still are working , Boeing said .
Under Kansas right - to - work laws , contracts can not require workers to be union members .
Boeing has declined to say how many employees are working at its giant Renton , Wash. , plant .
Union officials could n't be reached for comment .
What does n't belong here ?
A. manual typewriters , B. black - and - white snapshots , C. radio adventure shows .
If you guessed black - and - white snapshots , you 're right .
After years of fading into the background , two - tone photography is coming back .
Trendy magazine advertisements feature stark black - and - white photos of Hollywood celebrities pitching jeans , shoes and liquor .
Portrait studios accustomed to shooting only in color report a rush to black - and - white portrait orders .
And black - and - white photography classes are crowded with students .
What 's happening in photography mirrors the popularity of black and white in fashion , home furnishings and cinematography .
On Seventh Avenue , designers have been advancing the monochrome look with clothing collections done entirely in black and white .
And classic black - and - white movies are enjoying a comeback on videocassette tapes , spurred , in part , by the backlash against colorization of old films .
`` The pendulum is swinging back to black and white , '' says Richard DeMoulin , the general manager of Eastman Kodak Co. 's professional photography division .
Until two years ago , sales of black - and - white film had been declining steadily since the 1960s .
But last year , buoyed by increased use in advertising and other commercial applications , sales increased 5 % , and they are expected to jump at least that much again this year .
Photographic companies are scrambling to tap the resurging market , reviving some black - and - white product lines and developing new ones .
At Kodak , which largely ignored the market for years , black - and - white film sales now account for nearly 15 % of the company 's $ 3 billion in film and paper sales annually , up from 10 % three years ago .
The Rochester , N.Y. , photographic giant recently began marketing T - Max 3200 , one of the fastest and most sensitive monochrome films .
Aimed at commercial photographers , the film can be used in very low light without sacrificing quality , says Donald Franz of Photofinishing Newsletter .
Also trying to snare a portion of the $ 2 billion - a - year industry is Agfa Corp. , a unit of Bayer AG .
Agfa recently signed Olympic gold medalist Florence Griffith - Joyner to endorse a new line of black - and - white paper that 's geared to consumers and will compete directly with Kodak 's papers .
Slated for market by the end of the year , the paper `` could have been introduced a long time ago but the market was n't there then , '' says an Agfa spokesman .
The biggest beneficiary of the black - and - white revival is likely to be International Paper Co. 's Ilford division , known in the industry for its premium products .
Sales of Ilford 's four varieties of black - and - white film this year are outpacing growth in the overall market , although the company wo n't say by exactly how much .
`` We hope the trend lasts , '' says Laurie DiCara , Ilford 's marketing communications director .
Why all the interest ?
For baby boomers who grew up being photographed in color , black and white seems eye - catching and exotic .
`` It has an archival , almost nostalgic quality to it , '' says Owen B. Butler , the chairman of the applied photography department at Rochester Institute of Technology .
`` You can shift out of reality with black and white , '' he adds .
Such features have been especially attractive to professional photographers and marketing executives , who have been steadily increasing their use of black and white in advertising .
Processing of black - and - white commercial film jumped 24 % last year to 18.7 million rolls .
Consider Gap Inc. , whose latest ad campaign features black - and - white shots of Hollywood stars , artists and other well - known personalities modeling the retailer 's jeans and T - shirts .
Richard Crisman , the account manager for the campaign , says Gap did n't intentionally choose black and white to distinguish its ads from the color spreads of competitors .
`` We wanted to highlight the individual , not the environment , '' he says , `` and black and white allows you to do that better than color . ''
The campaign won a Cleo award as this year 's best ad by a specialty retailer .
Even food products and automobiles , which have long depended on color , are making the switch .
Companies `` feel black and white will convey a stronger statement , '' says Marc L. Hauser , a Chicago photographer who is working on a black - and - white print ad for Stouffer Food Corp. 's Lean Cuisine .
Other companies that are currently using two - tone ads include American Express Co. and Epson America Inc .
Portrait studios have also latched onto the trend .
Using black and white , `` we can make housewives look like stars , '' says John Perrin .
His On - Broadway Photography studio in Portland , Ore. , doubled its business last year and , he says , is booked solid for the next five .
One customer , Dayna Brunsdon , says she spurned a color portrait for black and white because `` it 's more dramatic .
I show it to my friends , and they all say ` wow . '
It is n't ordinary like color . ''
Still , most consumers are n't plunking black - and - white film into their cameras to take family snapshots .
One big obstacle is that few drugstores develop the film anymore .
Typically , it must be mailed to a handful of processors and may take a week or more to be processed and returned .
Black - and - white film costs consumers a little less than color film , and processing costs the same .
But for photofinishers , developing costs for black - and - white film are higher .
Some companies are starting to tackle that problem .
Ilford , for example , recently introduced a black - and - white film that can be processed quickly by color labs .
Intent on wooing customers , the company is also increasing its sponsorship of black - and - white photography classes .
Similarly , Agfa is sponsoring scores of photography contests at high schools and colleges , offering free black - and - white film and paper as prizes .
And Kodak is distributing an instructional video to processors on how to develop its monochrome film more efficiently .
Other companies are introducing related products .
Charles Beseler Co. , a leading maker of photographic enlargers , introduced last month a complete darkroom starter kit targeted at teen - agers who want to process their own black - and - white photographs .
The kit , which has a suggested retail price of $ 250 and has already become a bestseller , was introduced after retailers noticed numerous requests from parents for children 's photography equipment .
`` It seems computers as hobbies have waned , '' says Ian Brightman , Beseler 's chairman and chief executive officer .
But some industry observers believe the resurgence of black and white is only a fad .
They cite the emergence of still electronic photography , more newspapers turning to color on their pages and measurable improvements in the quality of color prints .
`` Black and white has n't made the same quantum leaps in technological development as color , '' says Mr. Butler of the Rochester Institute .
`` The color print today is far superior to prints of 10 years ago .
You ca n't say the same with black and white . ''
But when Popular Photography , a leading magazine for photographers , selected 15 of the greatest photos ever made for its latest issue celebrating photography 's 150th anniversary , all were black and white .
`` It 's got a classic spirit and carries over emotionally , '' says Alfred DeBat of Professional Photographers of America .
`` That 's the appeal .
Steve Clark , a Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. trader , reported for work at 5 a.m. , two and a half hours before the usual Monday morning strategy meeting .
At Jefferies & Co. , J. Francis Palamara did n't reach the office until 5:30 a.m. , but then he had been up most of the night at home .
`` I had calls all night long from the States , '' he said .
`` I was woken up every hour -- 1:30 , 2:30 , 3:30 , 4:30 .
People are looking for possible opportunities to buy , but nobody wants to stick their chin out . ''
For many of London 's securities traders , it was a day that started nervously in the small hours .
By lunchtime , the selling was at near - panic fever .
But as the day ended in a frantic Wall Street - inspired rally , the City breathed a sigh of relief .
So it went yesterday in the trading rooms of London 's financial district .
In the wake of Wall Street 's plunge last Friday , the London market was considered especially vulnerable .
And before the opening of trading here yesterday , all eyes were on early trading in Tokyo for a clue as to how widespread the fallout might be .
By the time trading officially got under way at 9 a.m. , the news from Asia was in .
And it left mixed signals for London .
Tokyo stocks closed off a significant but less - than - alarming 1.8 % on thin volume ; Hong Kong stocks declined 6.5 % in orderly trading .
At Jefferies ' trading room on Finsbury Circus , a stately circle at the edge of the financial district , desktop computer screens displayed the London market 's major barometer -- the Financial Times - Stock Exchange 100 Share Index .
Red figures on the screens indicated falling stocks ; blue figures , rising stocks .
Right away , the reds outnumbered the blues , 80 to 20 , as the index opened at 2076.8 , off 157.1 points , or 7 % .
`` I see concern , but I do n't see any panic , '' said Mr. Palamara , a big , good - humored New York native who runs the 15 - trader office .
The Jefferies office , a branch of the Los Angeles - based firm , played it conservatively , seeking to avoid risk .
`` This is not the sort of market to have a big position in , '' said David Smith , who heads trading in all non-U.S. stocks .
`` We tend to run a very tight book . ''
Jefferies spent most of its energies in the morning trying to match buyers and sellers , and there were n't many buyers .
`` All the takeover stocks -- Scottish & Newcastle , B.A.T , DRG -- are getting pretty well pasted this morning , '' Mr. Smith said .
Seconds later , a 7,500 - share `` sell '' order for Scottish & Newcastle came in .
For the third time in 15 minutes , a trader next to Mr. Smith left the no - smoking area to have a cigarette .
On the screens , only two forlorn blue figures remained , but the index had recovered a few points and was off about 140 .
`` Because Tokyo did n't collapse , let 's pick up a little stock , '' Mr. Smith said .
He targeted 7,500 shares of Reuters and punched a button to call up on his screen other dealers ' price quotes .
The vivid yellow figures showed the best price at 845 pence , -LRB- $ 13.27 -RRB- and Mr. Smith 's traders started putting out feelers .
But the market sensed a serious buyer on a day dominated by selling , and the quotes immediately jumped to 850 pence .
`` When I want to buy , they run from you -- they keep changing their prices , '' Mr. Smith said .
`` It 's very frustrating . ''
He temporarily abandoned his search for the Reuters shares .
By this time , it was 4:30 a.m. in New York , and Mr. Smith fielded a call from a New York customer wanting an opinion on the British stock market , which had been having troubles of its own even before Friday 's New York market break .
`` Fundamentally dangerous ... , '' Mr. Smith said , almost in a whisper , `` ... . fundamentally weak ... fairly vulnerable still ... extremely dangerously poised ...
we 're in for a lot of turbulence ... . ''
He was right .
By midday , the London market was in full retreat .
`` It 's falling like a stone , '' said Danny Linger , a pit trader who was standing outside the London International Financial Futures Exchange .
Only half the usual lunchtime crowd gathered at the tony Corney & Barrow wine bar on Old Broad Street nearby .
Conversation was subdued as most patrons watched the latest market statistics on television .
At 12:49 p.m. , the index hit its low , 2029.7 , off 204.2 points .
`` France opened the limit down , off at least 10 % if you could calculate the index , which you could n't , '' Mr. Clark , the Shearson trader , said early in the afternoon .
`` Spain is down 10 % and suspended , Sweden 's down 8 % , Norway 11 % .
This market has been very badly damaged . ''
As 2:30 p.m. -- Wall Street 's opening time -- neared , Shearson traders and salesmen traded bets on how low the New York market would open .
In the center of the trading floor , chief trader Roger Streeter and two colleagues scrambled for the telephones as soon as the New York market opened -- plummeting more than 60 points in the first few minutes .
They saw an opportunity created by the sell - off .
As Wall Street traders dumped American Depositary Receipts in Jaguar PLC , Mr. Streeter and trader Sam Ruiz bought them to resell in the U.K .
Investors here still expect Ford Motor Co. or General Motors Corp. to bid for Jaguar .
Suddenly , after about 45 minutes , the U.S. markets rallied .
`` The MMI has gone better , '' shouted one trader at about 3:15 London time , as the U.S. Major Markets Index contract suddenly indicated a turnabout .
As Wall Street strengthened , the London trading room went wild .
Traders shouted as their screens posted an ever - narrowing loss on Wall Street .
Then , nine minutes later , Wall Street suddenly rebounded to a gain on the day .
`` Rally ! Rally ! Rally ! '' shouted Shearson trader Andy Rosen , selling more Jaguar shares .
`` This is panic buying ! ''
As the London market rallied , some wondered whether the weekend of worrying and jitters had been worth it .
The London index closed at 2163.4 , its high for the day , off 70.5 , or about 3.3 % .
First , there was a death watch .
Then exhilaration .
Spurred by waves of large - scale buying in blue - chip stocks , the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied yesterday and erased about a half of Friday 's 190.58 - point plunge , gaining 88.12 to 2657.38 .
It was the fourth - biggest advance for the average of 30 blue chips , on frenetic New York Stock Exchange volume of 416,290,000 shares -- the highest since the days after the 1987 crash .
While the advance cheered investors who feared a 1987 - style crash would occur yesterday , it was strictly a big - stock rally fed by huge buying by bargain - hunting institutions and program traders .
A troubling sign : Declining stocks on the Big Board outnumbered advancers , 975 to 749 , and the over - the - counter market that includes many smaller stocks suffered aftershocks of Friday 's late Big Board plunge .
The Nasdaq OTC index closed down 6.31 to 460.98 .
Meanwhile , in a divergence in two of the market 's most important indicators , the Dow industrials ' sister average , the 20 - stock Dow Jones Transportation Average , tumbled 102.06 to 1304.23 -- its second - worst decline next to the 164.78 - point fall during the 1987 crash .
Transports plunged on takeover disappointments in two airline stocks , UAL and AMR , which each fell more than 20 % when they reopened for trading yesterday after being suspended Friday afternoon .
UAL , the takeover stock at the center of Friday 's 190.58 - point market plunge , fell 56 7/8 to 222 7/8 on nearly 2.3 million shares .
Overall , `` this is a pleasant rally but it 's very selective , '' said Arthur Cashin Jr. , a veteran PaineWebber Inc. trader at the Big Board .
`` Everyone was a little concerned about the general narrowness of the rally and failure of the OTC market to get into plus territory .
It 's just a strange feeling .
I do n't think anyone left the place whistling Dixie . ''
The rally gave credence , at least for now , to the pre-trading declaration of Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. that Friday 's market debacle was `` an abnormal condition , and not a disaster . ''
But to traders , it looked like disaster on the 9:30 a.m. opening bell .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened down 1.64 shortly after 9:30 .
But most of the 30 blue - chip stocks in the average , including Eastman Kodak and General Motors , could n't trade because of the heavy backlog of sell orders left over from Friday 's late - afternoon rout .
At 9:45 , Procter & Gamble -- one of the most important Dow bellwethers of late -- opened down 2 3/4 to 117 .
The Dow dropped to a quick 27 - point loss , and to many traders it looked as if stocks were headed for yet another big tumble .
More stocks opened over the ensuing half hour , as the 49 Big Board specialist firms in charge of keeping the market orderly groped to find buy orders from major brokerage firms to match the selling flood .
Then , to make matters worse , computerized sell programs kicked in , hammering stocks into steeper losses .
There was heavy stock - index arbitrage , as traders sold big baskets of stock and bought stock - index futures to profit from the price discrepancies between the two markets .
This was a hangover from Friday , when Standard & Poor 's 500 - stock index futures had closed at a sharp discount to stocks .
The onslaught of the program selling dashed any hopes that some of the big program trading firms would hold off until the market stabilized .
They did n't .
The Dow accelerated its slide , losing 63.52 in the first 40 minutes of trading .
With program traders seemingly in charge , buyers backed away from the market and watched stocks fall .
Then at 10:15 the Dow suddenly started to rebound , and when it shot upward it did so even faster than the early - morning fall .
And this time , it was n't just the program traders who were responsible .
All the selling had pushed stocks to such cheap values that big investment banks and major money management firms started buying stocks heavily .
The program traders were in there , too , of course .
But according to one trader , the programmers `` did n't look as dominant on the upside as on the downside because there was -LCB- also -RCB- a lot of bargain - hunting '' by institutions .
Roland M. Machold , director of the New Jersey Division of Investment , which oversees $ 29 billion in investments , said the `` first thing we did was to double our orders '' yesterday morning .
`` With the market down like this , we 'll probably take another $ 50 million and put it in '' the market .
Trading in Walt Disney Co. particularly caught traders ' eyes .
According to Big Board officials , Disney had one of the biggest sell - order imbalances on Friday ; it was one of the seven stocks that could n't finish trading that day .
The stock opened late at 114 1/2 , down 8 1/2 .
But then it shot upward 7 1/2 as Goldman , Sachs & Co. stepped in and bought , traders said .
However , Disney specialist Robert Fagenson said : `` I would be surprised if Goldman represented 4 % of the opening volume . ''
Around Wall Street , trading desks were relieved that they could at least play the market yesterday , in contrast to Friday 's gridlock .
At Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. , head equity trader Dudley Eppel said : `` I think the opening was constructive .
It was orderly .
We put some orders together .
There was n't a lot of panic selling , either domestically or internationally ... .
Not like Friday where they just took -LCB- the market -RCB- apart . ''
Still , the market had n't yet crossed into positive territory , and traders were glum .
But in another dramatic burst , the Dow tacked on 42 points in five minutes , and at 10:25 the index showed a gain of 5.74 .
On the Big Board floor and on trading desks , traders yelped their approval .
Grinned Griffith Peck , a trader in Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 's OTC department : `` I tell you , this market acts healthy . ''
Around him , scores of traders seemed to get a burst of energy ; their boss broke out bottles of Perrier water to cool them off .
Among Big Board specialists , the cry was `` Pull your offers '' -- meaning that specialists soon expected to get higher prices for their shares .
`` It was bedlam on the upside , '' said one Big Board specialist .
But not everybody was making money .
The carnage on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , the nation 's major options market , was heavy after the trading in S&P 100 stock - index options was halted Friday .
Many market makers in the S&P 100 index options contract had bullish positions Friday , and when the shutdown came they were frozen with huge losses .
Over the weekend , clearing firms told the Chicago market makers to get out of their positions at any cost Monday morning .
`` They were absolutely killed , slaughtered , '' said one Chicago - based options trader .
Some traders said that the closely watched Major Market Index , whose 20 stocks mimic the Dow industrials , did n't lead yesterday 's big rally .
James Gallagher , a partner at specialist Fowler & Rosenau , said , `` The difference between today and two years ago '' -- `` Terrible Tuesday , '' Oct. 20 , 1987 -- `` is that then we needed a savior to go into the Major Market Index , spend $ 2 million and get the program rally started .
This time -LCB- institutions -RCB- saw the programs coming and backed away and backed away .
Then when the market was at a technical level to buy , they came in with a vengeance . ''
However , according to one analyst , the timing of Major Market Index futures buying just before the turnaround was similar to that of Terrible Tuesday .
`` Futures were pulling the stock market higher , '' said Donald Selkin , head of stock - index futures research at Prudential - Bache Securities Inc .
Although the Big Board 's specialist firms struggled through another highly volatile trading session , their performance yesterday was better than during Friday 's late - afternoon chaos , according to traders and brokers who work with them .
Specialists were criticized for their inability to maintain orderly markets during the Friday plunge .
But yesterday , even with halts in such major blue - chip stocks as Merck , `` we expected -LRB- the halts -RRB- and it was n't too bad , '' said Donaldson 's Mr. Eppel , who had been critical of the specialists ' performance on Friday .
According to a Big Board official , while many stocks opened late , there were subsequent trading halts in only three issues -- AMR , Merck and Valero Energy .
Merck is one of the most important stocks in the Major Market Index .
No sector of the market has been spared during the past two days ' gyrations .
Yet from the Dow industrials ' high on Oct. 9 through Friday 's plunge , relatively good performances have been turned in by real - estate , utilities , precious metals and life insurance stocks .
And yesterday , the top performing industry group was oil field equipment issues .
For example , Halliburton jumped 3 1/4 to 38 , Schlumberger rose 2 1/2 to 43 1/4 and Baker Hughes rose 1 1/8 to 22 .
Because of the UAL and AMR tumbles , airlines were the weakest sector of the market yesterday .
Philip Morris was the Big Board 's most active issue , rising 2 1/4 to 43 1/4 on nearly eight million shares .
Among other major issues , Coca - Cola Co. closed up 2 at 66 3/4 on 1.7 million shares and American Telephone & Telegraph rose 3 1/4 to 43 on nearly 7.8 million shares .
Shares of International Business Machines , which reported earnings yesterday , finished at 103 , up 1 , after slipping below 100 during Friday 's session for the first time in five years .
Shares of three brokerage firms rose after they reported earnings .
Merrill Lynch added 1 3/4 to 28 , PaineWebber rose 3/4 to 18 1/2 and Bear Stearns rose 3/8 to 14 1/4 .
Federal National Mortgage Association , a recently hot stock , climbed 4 to 124 on nearly 1.6 million shares .
At a news conference after the close of trading yesterday , the Big Board 's Mr. Phelan and other exchange officials praised the performance of their computers and personnel .
Mr. Phelan said that program trading strategies were n't responsible for triggering Friday 's decline despite a jump in the use of the computer - driven strategies in recent months .
Some 24 million of the more than 100 million shares traded in the final 90 minutes of Friday 's session , when the plunge in stock prices was concentrated , were program - related , he said .
Program trades make up 10 % of the exchange 's volume on an average day , but despite the increase Friday , it was `` certainly not something you would say precipitated the market decline , '' Mr. Phelan said .
Mr. Phelan expressed relief that the market rebounded yesterday .
`` Obviously , every time we get this kind of reaction , it 's going to make everybody nervous , including me , '' he said .
He said that exchange officials had conversations with Wall Street firms throughout the weekend and that `` all the participants behaved very , very responsibly today . ''
Meanwhile , Peter DaPuzzo , Shearson 's head of retail equity trading , praised institutional investors in the OTC market , who were heavy buyers of the Nasdaq 's biggest technology issues yesterday amid a flood of selling by other investors .
`` The institutions ca n't be criticized for their behavior , '' Mr. DaPuzzo said in an interview .
`` It was the opposite of what happened on Oct. 19 .
They used their judgment .
They did n't panic during the first round of selling this morning .
Instead , they bought on weakness and sold into the strength , which kept the market orderly .
Maybe they learned from experience . ''
Mr. Phelan said the performance of specialists during Friday 's plunge was admirable , because out of 1,640 Big Board common stocks traded during the day only seven were closed and were n't reopened before the close .
`` They did an excellent job , '' Mr. Phelan said of the specialists .
Wall Street traders on Friday had complained about the trading suspensions .

Britain 's Blue Arrow PLC intends to change its name to Manpower PLC and write off a chunk of the nearly $ 1.2 billion in good will realized in the takeover of U.S. - based Manpower Inc .
Blue Arrow Chairman Mitchell Fromstein said in an interview that the two steps may be a prelude to reincorporating the world 's biggest employment - services group in the U.S. .
Mr. Fromstein disclosed the planned steps , expected within a few months , as Blue Arrow posted a 2.5 % drop in its third - quarter pretax earnings .
The name change and good will write - off could help solidify Blue Arrow 's dominance of the U.S. temporary - help market and give it a more American image as U.S. investors turn jittery about foreign stocks after Friday 's market plunge .
U.S. holders now own more than 60 % of Blue Arrow compared with 9 % last January .
`` In the U.S. market , the recognition of the Manpower name is infinitely stronger than Blue Arrow , '' Mr. Fromstein said .
The moves also could erase shareholders ' perception of Blue Arrow as a company in turmoil .
`` It further reinforces the concept that Blue Arrow is a thing of the past , '' said Doug Arthur , an analyst at Kidder Peabody & Co. in New York .
The proposed changes `` all make a lot of sense to me , '' he added .
In a widely publicized boardroom coup , Mr. Fromstein ousted Antony Berry as Blue Arrow chief executive in January , a month after Mr. Berry had forced Mr. Fromstein out as the $ 1 million - a - year chief of Milwaukee - based Manpower .
Mr. Fromstein solidified his control in April by taking over from Mr. Berry as chairman .
But the Blue Arrow tumult is n't over yet , as the British government is investigating a disputed # 25 million -LRB- $ 39.4 million -RRB- loan which Mr. Fromstein has said was made under Mr. Berry 's direction .
Blue Arrow was able to pull off the $ 1.34 billion takeover of Manpower in 1987 largely because different British and American accounting standards produce higher reported earnings for British companies .
Under British rules , Blue Arrow was able to write off at once the $ 1.15 billion in good will arising from the purchase .
As a U.S. - based company , Blue Arrow would have to amortize the good will over as many as 40 years , creating a continuing drag on reported earnings .
Good will is the excess of cost of an acquired firm , operating unit or assets over the current or fair market value of those assets .
But with so many shares now held in the U.S. , Blue Arrow reports its earnings two ways , based on both U.K. and U.S. accounting standards .
`` Our balance sheets look like they came from Alice 's wonderland , '' Mr. Fromstein said .
The British version shows `` a handful of pounds of net worth '' following the 1987 write - off of good will , while the American version reflects `` $ 1 billion of net worth because almost none of -LCB- the good will -RCB- has been written off . ''
Mr. Fromstein said he hopes to eradicate some of the good will left on Blue Arrow 's U.S. books in one fell swoop , but would n't specify how much .
People close to Blue Arrow suggested the write - down would represent a sizable chunk , with executives claiming prior management overstated the extent of Manpower 's good will .
That move , along with the return to the Manpower name , could bolster the company 's prospects during possibly difficult times for temporary help .
The number of U.S. temporary workers fell about 1 % in the 12 months ending Aug. 31 , after sliding nearly 3.5 % in July , said Kidder Peabody 's Mr. Arthur .
Blue Arrow blamed the pretax profit drop in the quarter ended July 31 partly on slower earnings growth of non-Manpower units in Britain .
Overall , pretax profit slid to # 18.49 million in the quarter from # 18.98 million a year earlier .
Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it reduced its rating on $ 281 million of senior and subordinated debt of this thrift holding company , to C from Ca , saying it believes bondholders will recover only `` negligible principal . ''
The agency said it confirmed American Continental 's preferred stock rating at C .
American Continental 's thrift unit , Los Angeles - based Lincoln Savings & Loan Association , is in receivership and the parent company has filed for protection from creditor lawsuits under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code .
CENTRUST SAVINGS BANK -LRB- Miami -RRB- --
Moody 's Investors Service Inc. downgraded its ratings on the subordinated debt of CenTrust to Caa from B - 3 .
The rating agency also reduced the ratings for long - term deposits to B - 3 from Ba - 3 and for preferred stock to Ca from Caa .
The rating agency said about $ 85 million in securities was affected .
The downgrades were prompted , Moody 's said , by the continuing turmoil in the junk bond market and the suspension of dividends on CenTrust 's preferred stock .
Moody 's also said it believed the proposed sale of 63 CenTrust branches to Great Western Bank could , if completed , endanger the thrift 's funding and market position .
Congress has been critical of the Bush administration for not sending enough aid to Poland , so it is getting ready to send its own version of a CARE package .
Last month , the Senate voted to send a delegation of congressional staffers to Poland to assist its legislature , the Sejm , in democratic procedures .
Senator Pete Domenici calls this effort `` the first gift of democracy . ''
The Poles might do better to view it as a Trojan Horse .
It is the vast shadow government of 15,000 congressional staffers that helps create such legislative atrocities as the 1,376 page , 13 - pound reconciliation bill that claimed to be the budget of the United States .
Maybe after the staffers explain their work to the Poles , they 'd be willing to come back and do the same for the American people .
Influential members of the House Ways and Means Committee introduced legislation that would restrict how the new savings - and - loan bailout agency can raise capital , creating another potential obstacle to the government 's sale of sick thrifts .
The bill , whose backers include Chairman Dan Rostenkowski -LRB- D. , Ill. -RRB- , would prevent the Resolution Trust Corp. from raising temporary working capital by having an RTC - owned bank or thrift issue debt that would n't be counted on the federal budget .
The bill intends to restrict the RTC to Treasury borrowings only , unless the agency receives specific congressional authorization .
`` Such agency ` self - help ' borrowing is unauthorized and expensive , far more expensive than direct Treasury borrowing , '' said Rep. Fortney Stark -LRB- D. , Calif. -RRB- , the bill 's chief sponsor .
The complex financing plan in the S&L bailout law includes raising $ 30 billion from debt issued by the newly created RTC .
This financing system was created in the new law in order to keep the bailout spending from swelling the budget deficit .
Another $ 20 billion would be raised through Treasury bonds , which pay lower interest rates .
But the RTC also requires `` working '' capital to maintain the bad assets of thrifts that are sold , until the assets can be sold separately .
That debt would be paid off as the assets are sold , leaving the total spending for the bailout at $ 50 billion , or $ 166 billion including interest over 10 years .
`` It 's a problem that clearly has to be resolved , '' said David Cooke , executive director of the RTC .
The agency has already spent roughly $ 19 billion selling 34 insolvent S&Ls , and it is likely to sell or merge 600 by the time the bailout concludes .
Absent other working capital , he said , the RTC would be forced to delay other thrift resolutions until cash could be raised by selling the bad assets .
`` We would have to wait until we have collected on those assets before we can move forward , '' he said .
The complicated language in the huge new law has muddied the fight .
The law does allow the RTC to borrow from the Treasury up to $ 5 billion at any time .
Moreover , it says the RTC 's total obligations may not exceed $ 50 billion , but that figure is derived after including notes and other debt , and subtracting from it the market value of the assets the RTC holds .
But Congress did n't anticipate or intend more public debt , say opponents of the RTC 's working - capital plan , and Rep. Charles Schumer -LRB- D. , N.Y . -RRB- said the RTC Oversight Board has been remiss in not keeping Congress informed .
`` That secrecy leads to a proposal like the one from Ways and Means , which seems to me sort of draconian , '' he said .
`` The RTC is going to have to pay a price of prior consultation on the Hill if they want that kind of flexibility . ''
The Ways and Means Committee will hold a hearing on the bill next Tuesday .
Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan has chosen Antonia Novello to be the next surgeon general , Bush administration officials said .
If she is nominated by President Bush and confirmed by the Senate , Dr. Novello would succeed C. Everett Koop , who rattled liberals and conservatives alike with his outspoken views on a range of health issues .
Dr. Novello , an expert on pediatric kidney diseases , is deputy director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development .
She has also served on several task forces on acquired immune deficiency syndrome .
Dr. Novello 's office said she would n't talk with reporters , and it refused to release any information about her .
The newsletter Medicine & Health , which first disclosed her selection by Dr. Sullivan , said she is 44 years old and she studied at the University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine .
Intel Corp. said it reached an agreement with Alliant Computer Systems Corp. to develop software standards for Intel 's i860 microprocessor .
The i860 , introduced earlier this year , is Intel 's entry in the crowded market for reduced instruction set computing , or RISC , computers .
Intel , based in Santa Clara , Calif. , is the market leader for traditional microprocessors with its 8086 family that forms the heart of IBM - compatible personal computers .
Under the agreement , Intel will invest $ 3 million to acquire a 4 % stake in Alliant , a maker of minisupercomputers for scientists and engineers .
Alliant , based in Littleton , Mass. , will license its parallel - computing technologies to Intel , providing users a way to let many i860 microprocessors in a single computer work on a problem simultaneously .
Alliant said it plans to use the microprocessor in future products .
It declined to discuss its plans for upgrading its current product line .
The market upheaval apparently has n't triggered any cash crunch -- yet .
Individual investors , investment firms and arbitragers who speculate in the stocks of takeover candidates can suffer liquidity and payment problems when stocks dive ; those investors often borrow heavily to buy their holdings and use the stocks as collateral for loans .
But several large banks said yesterday they detected no signs of unusual demand for credit that would signal such difficulties .
`` We 're seeing nothing out of the ordinary , '' said one official at a Top 10 bank .
`` That 's good news , because we all swim in this water . ''
Added another executive at a big bank : `` We were all a little goosey over the weekend trying to forecast what would happen -LCB- Monday -RCB- , but it 's been very quiet .
Now , as for tomorrow , hell , who knows ?
Hughes Aircraft Co. , a unit of General Motors Corp. , said it agreed to purchase the Electro - Optics Technology division of Perkin - Elmer Corp .
Terms of the agreement were n't disclosed .
But for the fiscal year ended July 31 , 1988 , the most recent period for which results were broken out , the Perkin - Elmer unit accounted for more than half the $ 145 million in sales recorded by the company 's government systems sector .
Perkin - Elmer , which is based in Norwalk , Conn. , said the sale of the Danbury , Conn. , unit is consistent with its restructuring strategy announced in April .
In addition to making electro - optical systems , the unit also makes laser warning receivers .
These are used aboard military helicopters to warn pilots that a laser weapon has been focused on them .
Hughes of Los Angeles said the PerkinElmer unit 's work complements efforts by its Electro - Optical and Data Systems group , which makes infrared sensors , military lasers and night vision equipment .
Hughes said it expects the sale to close by year end .
Hertz Corp. of Park Ridge , N.J. , said it retained Merrill Lynch Capital Markets to sell its Hertz Equipment Rental Corp. unit .
`` There is no pressing need to sell the unit , but we are doing it so we can concentrate on our core business , renting automobiles in the U.S. and abroad , '' said William Slider , Hertz 's executive vice president .
`` We are only going to sell at the right price . ''
Hertz Equipment had operating profit before depreciation of $ 90 million on revenue of $ 150 million in 1988 .
The closely held Hertz Corp. had annual revenue of close to $ 2 billion in 1988 , of which $ 1.7 billion was contributed by its Hertz Rent A Car operations world - wide .
Hertz Equipment is a major supplier of rental equipment in the U.S. , France , Spain and the U.K .
It supplies commercial and industrial equipment including earth - moving , aerial , compaction and electrical equipment , compressors , cranes , forklifts and trucks .
Agip S.p . A. and Societe National Elf Aquitaine , the state oil companies of Italy and France , respectively , submitted an offer to buy Gatoil Suisse S.A .
The price was n't disclosed .
A spokesman for Gatoil said that the Swiss oil concern was examining the offer , submitted last Friday , along with two other offers , also submitted last week .
Those two offers were private and the spokesman refused to identify the bidding companies .
The spokesman further said that at least two more offers are expected from other companies within two weeks .
Gatoil Suisse owns an oil refinery in Switzerland with a capacity of 70,000 barrels a day , along with a network of gasoline retailing outlets .
Commodity futures prices generally reflected the stability of the stock market following its plunge Friday .
Yesterday , the stock market 's influence at first created nervousness .
Later , however , it became more of an undercurrent than a dominating force as individual markets reacted more to their own factors .
Gold , the traditional haven in times of financial crisis , continued its inverse lockstep with the dollar , rising early in the day as the currency fell , and then giving up some of its gains as the dollar recovered .
Copper and crude oil reacted sharply to the concern that a crash yesterday could have a potentially devastating effect on the economy .
Copper fell and showed little rebound through the day as one of the major supply problems that had been supporting prices appeared to be solved .
Crude oil declined early , but as the stock market retained early gains , it , too , became stronger , ending with a small net loss .
Trading in cotton and sugar was nervous and showed small declines .
In Chicago , grain and soybean prices rose slightly .
Livestock and meat prices , however , dropped on concern that a financial crisis would cut consumption of beef and pork .
In commodity markets yesterday : PRECIOUS METALS : Futures prices were moderately higher as gold gave up some of its early gains and platinum behaved independently , first falling and then later rising .
Silver performed quietly .
The spot October gold price rose $ 4 to $ 367.30 an ounce .
The more active December delivery gold settled with a gain of $ 3.90 an ounce at $ 371.20 , after trading as high as $ 374 .
December silver was up 2.3 cents an ounce at $ 5.163 .
Platinum behaved more like an industrial metal , easing early on concern over a possible weaker economy , but recovering later , as the stock market strengthened .
Gold was nowhere the spectacular performer it was two years ago on Black Monday .
For one thing , last Friday , precious metals markets closed before the stock market went into its late - in - the - day nose dive , so it could n't react to it .
Back on Friday , Oct. 16 , l987 , the stock market declined during the day , and gold prices surged as the stock market fell .
The October 1987 contract that day rose as much as $ 8.70 to as high as $ 471.60 , and the more deferred positions , due to mature as late as March 1989 , rose as much as $ 9.60 .
On Black Monday , Oct. 19 , 1987 , the October contract tacked on further gains , rising to as high as $ 491.50 for a gain of almost $ 20 on top of the Friday advances , before giving up almost $ 10 of that at the close .
Yesterday 's October gain of $ 4 was miniscule compared with that .
One analyst , Peter Cardillo of Josephthal & Co. , New York , said the gold market already had some good price - supporting technical factors that would have caused prices to rise , with or without the stock market .
`` What the stock market did was cause the rise to take place earlier than it would have happened , '' said Mr. Cardillo .
There 's a good chance that gold will retain its gains and rise further , he said .
He expects a drop in interest rates , which would help gold by keeping the dollar from rising .
Finally , according to Mr. Cardillo , the impact of the strong dollar should be reflected in reduced exports in the August merchandise trade deficit , when the figures are released today .
This would be damaging to the dollar and supportive for gold , he said .
ENERGY :
Worried that Friday 's 190 - point stock market plunge might be a harbinger of things to come for the economy , petroleum futures traders called a halt to the recent string of increases in crude oil futures prices .
The U.S. benchmark crude , West Texas Intermediate , closed at $ 20.59 a barrel for November delivery , down 30 cents .
Some analysts said crude was due for a correction anyhow , following several days of significant gains .
But most market observers agreed that Friday 's stock market drop is what dampened spirits in the petroleum pits yesterday .
Until yesterday , futures prices had been headed up on expectations that world oil demand will continue to be strong .
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries increased its production ceiling for the fourth quarter based on projections of robust demand .
So any bearish indicator , such as Friday 's precipitous drop in the stock market , sends shivers through the oil markets as well .
Indeed , after reacting early in the trading day to Friday 's plummet , futures prices firmed up again as traders took note of the stock market 's partial recovery yesterday .
COPPER :
Futures prices fell and showed little rebound as one major labor problem that had been underpinning prices appeared to be solved .
The December contract declined 3.05 cents a pound to $ 1.2745 .
Prices were down from the outset of trading on concern that a drop in the stock market might create a weakened economy and a consequent reduction in copper use .
But the recovery in the stock market provided little help for copper as word spread that a three - month strike at the Highland Valley mine in British Columbia was about over , according to an analyst .
Highland Valley is a large Canadian producer and principal supplier to Japan , which recently began seeking copper elsewhere as its inventories shrank .
Last week it was reported that company and union negotiations had overcome the major hurdle , the contracting out of work by the company .
Now , the analyst said , only minor points remain to be cleaned up .
`` For all intents and purposes , an agreement appears to have been achieved , '' he said .
Copper inventories in New York 's Commodity Exchange warehouses rose yesterday by 516 tons , to 10,004 tons .
London Metal Exchange copper inventories last week declined 13,575 tons , to 89,300 tons .
The LME stocks decline was about as expected , but the Comex gain was n't .
However , this was brushed aside by concern over the stock market , the analyst said .
At one point in futures trading , as the stock market firmed , the December contract rose to as high as $ 1.2965 , but it was n't able to sustain the gain .
`` It was simply overbought , '' he said , and selling by funds that are computer guided helped depress prices .
COTTON :
Futures prices eased , more in reaction to Hurricane Jerry than to any influence of the stock market .
The December contract ended with a loss of 0.22 cent a pound , at 74.48 cents .
Technical considerations following the hurricane , which was a factor in the market Friday , caused prices to decline yesterday , said Ernest Simon , cotton specialist for Prudential - Bache Securities , New York .
Prices rose sharply Friday as the storm approached Texas and Louisiana , which is part of the Mississippi Delta cotton - growing area .
However , after absorbing the potential effect of the hurricane , prices began to slip late Friday , Mr. Simon said .
That selling continued yesterday and kept prices under pressure , he said .
Colder weather is being predicted for the high plains of Texas and the northern states of the Delta during the coming weekend , Mr. Simon said .
That has n't yet captured traders ' attention , he added .
SUGAR :
Futures prices declined .
The March contract was off 0.32 cent a pound at 13.97 cents .
At one point in early trading the March price rose to as high as 14.22 cents when the stock market recovered , but the price then fell back .
A price - depressing factor , one analyst said , was that India , which had been expected to buy around 200,000 tons of sugar in the world market , did n't make any purchases .
India recently bought 200,000 tons and was expected to buy more , the analyst said .
Another analyst thought that India may have pulled back because of the concern over the stock market .
`` India may have felt that if there was a severe drop in the stock market and it affected sugar , it could buy at lower prices , '' said Judith Ganes , analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton , New York .
At any rate , she added , `` India needs the sugar , so it will be in sooner or later to buy it . ''
FARM PRODUCTS :
The prices of cattle and hog futures contracts dropped sharply because traders speculated that the stock market plunge Friday will linger in the minds of U.S. consumers long enough to prompt them to rein in their spending at the supermarket , which would hurt demand for beef and pork .
The price of the hog contract for October delivery dropped its maximum permissible daily limit of 1.5 cents a pound .
The prices of most grain futures contracts rose slightly yesterday out of relief that the stock market was showing signs of recovering .
Earlier in the session , the prices of several soybean contracts set new lows .
A broad rally began when several major processors began buying futures contracts , apparently to take advantage of the price dip .
Tokyo share prices rebounded Tuesday morning , with the Nikkei index of 225 selected stocks rising 618.69 points to close the morning session at 35087.38 .
The index slid 647.33 points , or 1.8 % , on Monday .
In the first 25 minutes of Tuesday 's trading the Nikkei index soared 664.83 points , to 35133.83 .
By 10 a.m. Tokyo time , the index was up 435.11 points , to 34903.80 as investors hailed New York 's overnight rally .
Monday 's slide came in a relatively calm session that did n't provide much direction for other markets .
Shares also closed sharply lower across Europe , particularly in Frankfurt , although London and a few other markets recovered some ground after stocks began to rebound in New York .
Other Asian and Pacific markets had sharper losses than Tokyo , but the selling wave stopped short of precipitating another market crash .
All eyes were on Tokyo at the opening because it was the first major market to trade since Friday 's 190.58 - point plunge on Wall Street .
But rather than set the tone for other markets , Japan 's major institutional investors chose to remain on the sidelines .
Still , despite the sudden reappearance of stock - market turbulence , managers of Japanese investment funds said they were n't planning to unload U.S. or European equities .
`` We did n't trade much today , as our policy now is to wait and see , '' said a fund manager at Taisho Life Insurance Co .
`` We would like to wait and see until trading goes around through Europe and New York . ''
The institutions appeared confident that Japanese regulators would step in to ensure orderly trading if necessary , and there was considerable speculation during the day that the Finance Ministry was working behind the scenes to do just that .
But in the absence of panicky trading , its presence was never overtly felt .
At the close , the Nikkei average of 225 stocks stood at 34468.69 , down 647.33 points , or 1.8 % .
The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index sank 45.66 , or 1.7 % , to 2600.88 .
The day 's decline was generally in line with analysts ' weekend predictions .
Declining issues swamped advancers , 941 - 105 .
But volume was thin at 526.2 million shares , compared with 574.7 million Friday .
The market opened sharply lower , with the Nikkei average down nearly 600 after 20 minutes .
A midmorning rebound brought it back to show a gain of about 200 at the end of the morning session , but the rally failed in the afternoon , and the market closed near the day 's low .
The smaller stocks in the Tokyo market 's second section also posted their biggest decline of the year .
The Tokyo Stock Exchange index for the second section fell 100.96 , or 2.7 % , to 3655.40 .
Many investors , trying to outperform the market 's major indexes , have flocked to these small issues in recent weeks .
Japanese investors and traders expressed relief that the Tokyo market did n't fall more sharply .
But its performance did bear some resemblance to events of two years ago , during the October 1987 global stock market crash .
On Oct. 16 , 1987 -- the Friday before the Black Monday crash -- the New York market dropped 4.6 % , and Tokyo followed on Monday with a 2.4 % drop .
This time , Wall Street 's plunge of 6.9 % Friday was followed by yesterday 's 1.8 % loss in Tokyo .
Two years ago , Tokyo 's biggest fall came the day after New York 's 22.6 % Black Monday plunge , when the Nikkei average fell 14.9 % .
Thus , market participants yesterday were looking ahead nervously to Wall Street 's opening .
But in New York yesterday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 88.12 to close at 2657.38 on heavy volume of 416,290,000 shares , although declining issues still outnumbered advancing ones on the broad market .
Nobuto Yasuda , a director at Yamaichi Investment Trust & Management Co. , called yesterday 's session `` a good scenario '' for Japan .
`` Now we are looking for the time to place buy orders , '' he said .
`` For us institutional investors , the chance for buying has come . ''
Isao Ushikubo , general manager of the investment research department at Toyo Trust & Banking Co. , also was optimistic .
He described Friday 's plunge in the U.S. as a `` fleeting '' event resulting in part from excessive merger and acquisition activity .
`` Unless there is a panic , this is the best time to buy , as was the case two years ago , '' he said .
`` Those shares which had posted gains on M&A speculation were dashed with cold water , but as far as major stocks are concerned , there is n't much impact . ''
Other fund managers were similarly sanguine .
`` We have no plans to adjust our asset allocation in foreign equities , '' said Masato Murakami , chief portfolio manager in the pension fund management department at Yasuda Trust & Banking Co .
He said Friday 's Wall Street decline was `` well within the range of volatility '' that Yasuda Trust plans for when it charts its overseas investment strategy .
Among other Asian and Pacific markets , Malaysia and Singapore had the biggest losses , with the Kuala Lumpur composite index in Malaysia falling 11.5 % and Singapore 's Straits Times Industrial Index down 10 % .
Major indexes declined more than 8 % in Australia and New Zealand and 6.5 % in Hong Kong .
Bangkok , Manila , Seoul , Taipei and Jakarta escaped with slightly smaller losses .
Brokers and fund managers said the region 's markets were reacting to Friday 's Wall Street plunge even though that decline was due to local factors such as failed corporate buy - outs and a deteriorating junk - bond market .
`` It 's pure psychology , '' said William Au Yeung , an account executive for Drexel Burnham Lambert -LRB- HK -RRB- Ltd. in Hong Kong .
`` Markets in this region are n't so geared to leveraged buy - outs , and their economies generally are in good shape , but there 's no doubt that Asia is still following America 's lead . ''
Several analysts said Malaysia and Singapore had the biggest losses because they are relatively open to rapid cash flows .
Hong Kong is the region 's next most open market , but many foreign investors have been staying away from it since it plunged in June amid political turmoil in China .
`` Singapore took the hit because when people want to get out , they tend to go where the liquidity is , '' said Elizabeth Hambrecht , a regional analyst with Baring Securities -LRB- Hong Kong -RRB- Ltd .
She pointed out that even after Monday 's 10 % decline , the Straits Times index is up 24 % this year , so investors who bailed out generally did so profitably .
Similarly , Kuala Lumpur 's composite index yesterday ended 27.5 % above its 1988 close .
In Hong Kong , the Hang Seng Index fell 180.60 to finish at 2601.70 .
Trading was heavy at about one billion shares , compared with 473.9 million Friday .
But the session was orderly , in contrast to the market 's four - day closure after the 1987 crash .
Richard Chenevix - Trench , a director at Hong Kong - based Baring International Fund Managers Ltd. , said the market probably has n't hit bottom yet but is close .
`` If New York does n't collapse , I see maybe another 5 % on the downside , not counting the risk of bad news out of China , '' he said .
In Australia , Sydney 's All Ordinaries index closed at 1601.5 , down 8.1 % , its biggest drop since October 1987 .
But volume rose only to 162 million shares from 143 million Friday .
Nestor Hinzack , an analyst at brokerage firm Burdett , Buckeridge & Young Ltd. , described the market 's performance as `` sheep - like '' as investors fled to bluechip Australian stocks and shunned entrepreneurial companies they perceived as having any takeover premium built into the price .
London 's Financial Times - Stock Exchange 100 - share index , the most closely watched market barometer , ended at its intraday high of 2163.4 , down 70.5 , or 3.2 % .
At its low , shortly before Wall Street opened , it was off more than 130 points .
The Financial Times 30 - share index closed 79.3 points lower at 1738.7 .
Volume more than doubled to 959.3 million shares from 457.7 million Friday .
Prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange tumbled in heavy trading .
The decline in the German Stock Index of 203.56 points , or 12.8 % , to 1385.72 was the Frankfurt market 's steepest fall ever .
Retail investors dumped holdings on a massive scale , pushing some blue - chip shares down as much as 20 % .
Analysts cited memories of two years ago , when many small investors held on to their shares after the October crash but the West German market continued to decline steeply for the next three months .
Here are price trends on the world 's major stock markets , as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective , Geneva .

The House Aviation Subcommittee approved a bill that would give the transportation secretary authority to review and approve leveraged buy - outs of major U.S. airlines .
The collapsed plan to acquire UAL Corp. , parent of United Airlines , spurred quick action on the legislation , introduced Wednesday and approved by the subcommittee on a voice vote yesterday .
The bill is expected to be taken up by the Public Works and Transportation Committee tomorrow , and a floor vote by next week will be urged .
The measure drew criticism from the Bush administration and a parting shot from financier Donald Trump , who yesterday withdrew his takeover bid for AMR Corp. , the parent of American Airlines .
In a letter to subcommittee Chairman James Oberstar -LRB- D. , Minn. -RRB- , Mr. Trump criticized the bill as an explicit effort to thwart his bid for AMR , and said it contributed to the collapse of the deal .
Elaine Chao , deputy transportation secretary , also sent a letter to express the administration 's opposition to the bill `` in its present form . ''
Rep. Oberstar brushed off Mr. Trump 's allegations as an `` excuse for his own deal failing . ''
He also said the fact that the other letter had n't come from Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner indicated there is `` wiggle room '' in the administration 's position .
Mr. Oberstar and other committee members repeatedly stressed that the legislation was n't a response to any particular market situation .
But they cited the UAL and AMR examples as reasons to move quickly to enact this legislation .
Aides both in the House and Senate said the withdrawal of the Trump bid for AMR is n't likely to deflate efforts to push the legislation .
`` It 's still on the fast track and we still want to do it , '' said one Senate aide .
The bill is aimed at addressing the concern that an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures to pay off the debt incurred in a leveraged buy - out .
Currently , the transportation secretary does n't have clearly established authority to block mergers , but can take the drastic step of revoking the operating certificate of any carrier the official considers unfit .
Supporters of the legislation view the bill as an effort to add stability and certainty to the airline - acquisition process , and to preserve the safety and fitness of the industry .
In general , the bill would give the Transportation Department a 30 - day review period before 15 % or more of the voting stock of a major U.S. air carrier could be acquired .
It also would require the acquiring party to notify the transportation secretary and to provide all information relevant to determining the intent of the acquisition .
The bill would allow the secretary to reject a buy - out if sufficient information has n't been provided , or if the buy - out is likely to weaken the carrier financially , result in a substantial reduction in size of the airline through disposal of assets , or give control to a foreign interest .
If more information is needed , the secretary would have authority to extend the review period 20 days .
All the witnesses , both congressmen and industry experts , expressed support for the bill in order to prevent profiteers from cashing in on airline profits at the expense of safe , cost - effective service .
But several committee members disapproved , some backing Mr. Trump 's claim that the threat of regulation caused the failure of the UAL deal and the stock - market plunge .
One of the major concerns expressed by the dissenters was that large airlines would be prohibited from divesting themselves of smaller entities and producing independent spin - off companies .
British retail sales volume rose a provisional 0.4 % in September from August and was up 2.2 % from September 1988 , the Department of Trade and Industry said .
For the three months ended in September , retail sales volume was down 0.5 % from the previous three months and up 1.2 % from a year earlier .
Burmah Oil PLC , a British independent oil and specialty chemicals marketing concern , said SHV Holdings N.V. of the Netherlands has built up a 6.7 % stake in the company .
James Alexander , a Burmah spokesman , said SHV had previously owned `` a little under 5 % '' of Burmah for about two years .
The Dutch company had n't notified Burmah of its reason for increasing the stake , he said .
SHV , which last year merged its North Sea oil and gas operations with those of Calor Group PLC , has been pegged by speculators as a possible suitor for Burmah Oil in recent weeks .
SHV also owns 40 % of Calor .
Burmah , which owns the Castrol brand of lubricant oils , reported a 17 % rise in net income to # 43.5 million -LRB- $ 68.3 million -RRB- in the first half .

Baseball , that game of the long haul , is the quintessential sport of the mean , and the mean ol' law caught up with the San Francisco Giants in the World Series last weekend .
The team that dumped runs by the bushel on the Chicago Cubs in the National League playoffs was held to just one in two games by the home - team Oakland A 's , the gang that had been done unto similarly by the Los Angeles Dodgers and Orel Hershiser in last year 's tournament .
Morever , much of the damage was accomplished by A 's who had some catching up to do .
In game two , on a cool Sunday evening in this land of perpetual autumn , a lot of the catching up was done by the A 's catcher , Terry Steinbach .
He hit a 2 - 0 pitch from Rick Reuschel into the left - field stands in inning four to stretch his team 's lead from 2 - 1 to a decisive 5 - 1 , where it stayed .
So what if Steinbach had struck just seven home runs in 130 regular - season games , and batted in the seventh position of the A 's lineup .
`` If you get your pitch , and take a good swing , anything can happen , '' he later remarked .
On Saturday night , quite a few of the boys in green and gold salted away successes to salve the pain of past and , no doubt , future droughts .
Mark McGwire , the big , red - haired Oakland first baseman , had three hits in four at bats , two more than he 'd had in the five - game Dodger series in which he 'd gone 1 - for - 17 .
The A - men batting Nos. 6 through 9 , a.k.a. the `` bottom of the order , '' got seven of their team 's 11 hits and scored four of its runs in a 5 - 0 decision .
Right - hander Dave Stewart held the Giants to five hits to account for the zero on the other side of the Saturday ledger .
That he was the A 's winningest pitcher during its American League campaign with a 21 - 9 mark , plus two wins over Toronto in the playoffs , indicates he may have some evening up coming , but with the way his split - fingered fastball is behaving , that might not be this week .
The same goes for Mike Moore , another veteran who overcame early struggles to permit the Giants but a run and four hits in seven innings in Sunday 's contest .
`` Every guy they put out there had a better split - finger than the guy before , '' marveled Giant manager Roger Craig .
He 's an ex-hurler who 's one of the leading gurus of the fashionable delivery , which looks like a fastball until it dives beneath the lunging bat .
The upshot of the downshoot is that the A 's go into San Francisco 's Candlestick Park tonight up two games to none in the best - of - seven fest .
The stat to reckon with here says that about three of four clubs -LRB- 29 of 39 -RRB- that took 2 - 0 Series leads went on to win it all .
That 's not an average to soothe Giant rooters .
One might think that the home fans in this Series of the Subway Called BART -LRB- that 's a better name for a public conveyance than `` Desire , '' do n't you think ? -RRB- would have been ecstatic over the proceedings , but they observe them in relative calm .
Partisans of the two combatants sat side by side in the 49,000 - plus seats of Oakland Coliseum , and while they cheered their favorites and booed the opposition , hostilities advanced no further , at least as far as I could see .
A few folks even showed up wearing caps bearing the colors and emblems of both teams .
`` I 'm for the Giants today , but only because they lost yesterday .
I love 'em both .
The only thing I 'm rooting for is for the Series to go seven games , '' said David Williams , a Sacramento septuagenarian , at the Coliseum before Sunday 's go .
The above represents a triumph of either apathy or civility .
I choose to believe it 's the latter , although it probably springs from the fact that just about everyone out here , including the A 's and Giants , is originally from somewhere else .
Suffice it to say that if this were a New York Yankees - Mets series , or one between the Chicago Cubs and White Sox -LRB- hey , it 's possible -RRB- , you 'd need uniformed police in every other seat to separate opposing fans , and only the suicidal would bifurcate their bonnets .
Anyway , the A 's gave you a lot of heroes to root for .
In the opening game , besides Steinbach and Stewart , there was Walt Weiss , a twiggy - looking , second - year shortstop who had lost a couple months of the season to knee surgery .
He was flawless afield -LRB- ditto in game two -RRB- , moved a runner along in the A 's three - run second inning , and homered for his team 's final tally .
Such is his reputation among the East Bay Bashers that when he hit his first career home run last season , the fan who caught it agreed to turn the ball over to him in return for an autograph .
Not his autograph ; power - hitter McGwire 's .
An A 's co-hero of the second game was Rickey Henderson , who exemplifies the hot side of the hot - cold equation .
He smoked Toronto in the playoffs with six hits , seven walks and eight stolen bases in 22 at bats , and continued that by going 3 - for - 3 at the plate Sunday , along with walking , stealing a base and scoring a run .
`` When you 're in the groove , you see every ball tremendously , '' he lectured .
The cold guys in the set were Will Clark , Kevin Mitchell and Matt Williams , the Giants ' 3-4-5 hitters .
They combined for 25 hits , six home runs and 24 runs batted in in the five games against the Cubs .
They went a collective 5 - for - 24 here , with zero homers and ribbies .
It 's that last set of numbers , as much as anything else , that gives the Giants hope in the Series games to come .
`` I believe in the law of averages , '' declared San Francisco batting coach Dusty Baker after game two .
`` I 'd rather see a so - so hitter who 's hot come up for the other side than a good hitter who 's cold . ''
But the old Dodger slugger wisely offered no prediction about when good times would return to his side .
`` When it goes , you never know when you 'll get it back , '' he said .
`` That 's baseball .
The latest crewcut in the equities markets reminds me of the joke T. Boone Pickens tells about the guy who was run over by the parade .
When asked `` What went wrong ? '' the unfortunate victim replied , `` It was a combination of things . ''
And so it was on Gray Friday .
The grand marshal of this parade would appear to have been excess leverage .
Even if that is so , however , it 's probably the case that no barriers should have been erected to stop the procession before the end of the rout -LRB- e -RRB- .
The ceremonies began Friday afternoon when word spread that the UAL buy - out was collapsing .
Although the union - bidder expects to patch together a substitute offer , consisting of less cash , the failure to get cash from Japanese and American banks confirmed a growing fear among arbitragers that the pageant of high - leverage takeover deals is ending .
Lots of other entries made up the parade , of course -- notably a surprisingly large increase in producer prices , signalling Federal Reserve tightness ; and the Bush administration 's -LRB- temporary ? -RRB- defeat in trying to lower the capital - gains tax .
As usual , few favorable reviews were heard for that ever - present marching band of program traders , although most serious studies suggest they only play the music that others write .
What really spooked the crowds along Wall Street , however , was the sudden concern that , whatever the reason , the pool of debt capital is drying up .
Gray Friday reflects a panic mainly by the takeover arbitragers , rather than the small investor , as their highly margined investments in the `` deal '' stocks are jeopardized by the unexpected drying up of the lubricant for deal financing .
Deal stocks led the market down as they absorbed the heaviest losses .
UAL , which triggered the slide , opened Monday at $ 224 , down about 20 % from Thursday 's close .
AMR opened Monday at $ 80 , down nearly 20 % from Thursday 's close .
-LRB- Both took further hits yesterday . -RRB-
Hilton lost 20 % on Friday ; Paramount lost almost 11 % .
A careful look reveals that where deal financing has been secured , the target 's stock price was not affected on Friday .
The multibillion - dollar prospects , where the bidder must line up a consortium of banks and / or issue billions in high - yield debt , were where the damage was concentrated .
The market for so - called junk bonds has been setting the stage for Friday 's dramatic march for several weeks .
The growing financial difficulties of recent high - leverage restructurings or takeovers , such as Resorts International , Integrated Resources , and Campeau 's retailing empire , have cast a pall over the entire market for high - yield securities .
Investors have reacted by ignoring recent efforts to float junk bonds by Ohio Mattress and by forcing Ramada to postpone indefinitely its planned junk - bond sale and restructuring .
As a result , high - yield mutual funds have declined across the board and the many firms planning to sell $ 11 billion in junk bonds before year - end are experiencing anxious times .
These are all market excesses -LRB- putting aside the artificial boosts that the tax code gives to debt over equity -RRB- , and what we 've seen is the market reining them in .
Of course , Washington had n't been silent in the days leading up to the debacle , and its tendency to meddle in the leverage equation remains a troublesome prospect , but those preliminary steps should n't distract us from the basic market fundamentalism that was at work on Friday .
If it is correct to find that concerns over corporate debt and LBOs caused Gray Friday , what are the implications for policy makers ?
After all , the stock market 's response to the collapse of the UAL deal might be taken to confirm the anti-debt direction of regulators .
Is this a case where private markets are approving of Washington 's bashing of Wall Street ?
Absolutely not .
To the extent that Friday 's sell - off reflected a sudden reappraisal of the excesses of leverage , the message is that Wall Street and the private markets are fully capable of imposing the appropriate incentives and sanctions on corporate behavior .
The national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various LBO deals and leveraged restructurings .
The recent difficulties in the junk - bond markets and the scarcity of bank capital for recent deals underscores the wisdom of letting the free markets operate .
If takeover premiums become excessive , if LBO dealmakers become too aggressive , then the private market will recognize these problems more quickly and accurately than will policy makers , and the markets will move with lightning speed to impose appropriate sanctions .
Yes , the broader exchanges got caught up in the spiral , but they rode the tiger up all year .
Not surprisingly , he sometimes bites .
The arbitragers and takeover initiatiors got killed on Gray Friday , while the besieged managers of prospective targets cheered lustily .
If you identify with the besieged managers , you must concede that speedy and effective relief from the excesses of the takeover market is more likely to come from the marketplace than from Washington .
If you side with the arbitragers and raiders , you clearly have more to fear from private investors than from regulators , although the Delaware courts should never be underestimated .
The truth is , Washington understands politics better than economics .
Although the average citizen is probably not harmed too much from Washington 's rhetorical war against Wall Street regarding excessive financial leveraging , actual legislation would probably impose considerable harm .
Any such attempt to distinguish `` good debt '' from `` bad debt , '' or to draw the line at a particular industry , such as the airlines , is likely to blunt the spur that the proper amount of leverage provides both to equity markets and economic efficiency in general .
Far better for policy makers to concentrate on the war against drugs , Panama and the deficit , all of them parades that seem never to end .

Waterford Wedgwood PLC , a financially troubled Irish maker of fine crystal and Wedgwood china , reported that its pretax loss for the first six months widened to 10.6 million Irish punts -LRB- $ 14.9 million -RRB- from 5.8 million Irish punts a year earlier .
The results for the half were worse than market expectations , which suggested an interim loss of around 10 million Irish punts .
In a sharply weaker London market yesterday , Waterford shares were down 15 pence at 50 pence -LRB- 79 cents -RRB- .
The company reported a loss after taxation and minority interests of 14 million Irish punts , compared with a loss of 9.3 million Irish punts for the year - earlier period .
There were n't any extraordinary items .
Sales for the total group rose 27 % to 168.1 million Irish punts compared with 132.6 million Irish punts a year ago .
Waterford has decided against paying an interim dividend .
Waterford said the appointment of a new management team and the signing of a comprehensive labor agreement are expected to enhance the company 's long - term prospects .
Yesterday was , in the words of New York Stock Exchange Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. , just your `` reasonably normal , 400 million - share , up 88 - points day . ''
When it was all over and stocks had staged a huge recovery , Big Board officials were self - congratulatory about how well the day had gone .
They said the exchange 's trading procedures , personnel , equipment and links with other exchanges could n't have performed better .
`` We had no operating problems at all , '' Mr. Phelan said after the market closed .
`` All the things that we set up to slow down the process , to let people know that the market was in an extreme position , worked extremely well . ''
Prices for the 416.3 million shares that changed hands during the session were carried on the exchange 's trading tape with barely a delay , officials said .
While reaching blockbuster proportions yesterday , the volume was still well within the 600 million - share capacity that the exchange has said it can handle daily since beefing up its computers after the October 1987 crash .
The so - called circuit breakers devised by the Big Board and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to quell free falls in stock and futures prices were n't triggered yesterday because the markets were higher for most of the day .
Despite traders ' complaints , Mr. Phelan said the links with the Chicago futures market worked as planned in Friday 's rout to provide a cooling - off period .
Of greater help , the Big Board chairman said , was the `` natural circuit breaker '' of the weekend , that provided a breathing period that `` brought rationality back to the market .
Chicago investor William Farley agreed to sell three divisions of Cluett Peabody & Co. for about $ 600 million to Bidermann S.A. , a closely held clothing maker based in Paris .
Shortly after completing the $ 1.56 billion acquisition of West Point - Pepperell Inc. in April , Mr. Farley 's holding company , Farley Inc. , said it was considering the sale of Cluett , a leading shirt maker and one of West Point - Pepperell 's biggest units .
Included in the sale are Cluett units that make men 's shirts under the Arrow name , socks under the Gold Toe name and menswear through the Schoeneman division .
The companies said the agreement is subject to Bidermann 's receipt of financing and to regulatory and other approvals .
They said the sale is expected to be concluded by the end of November .
Mr. Farley said the sale of three of Cluett 's four main divisions plus other `` anticipated '' West Point - Pepperell asset sales by December , should bring in a total of about $ 700 million .
He did n't elaborate on other asset sales being considered .
Mr. Farley followed a similar pattern when he acquired Northwest Industries Inc. and then sold much of its assets .
But he kept Fruit of the Loom Inc. , the underwear maker that he still controls and serves as chairman and chief executive .
Cluett was an independent company until West Point - Pepperell acquired it for $ 375 million in cash and stock in 1986 .
In the fiscal year ended Sept. 30 , 1988 , Cluett had operating profit of $ 37 million on sales of $ 757 million .
Bidermann sells clothes under various labels , including Yves Saint Laurent and Bill Robinson for men and Ralph Lauren for women .
A spokesman said the company had sales of $ 400 million in 1988 .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , West Point - Pepperell fell 25 cents to $ 53.875 .
BSN S.A. , a leading French food group , said it agreed to acquire Birkel G.m.b . H. , a West German pasta maker .

The move is in line with BSN 's strategy of gradually building its share of the European pasta market through external growth .
BSN will initially acquire a 15 % interest in Birkel , a closely held concern .
The French group has an agreement giving it the right to buy all the shares outstanding , and this could be completed within a few months , a BSN spokeswoman said .
The takeover was submitted for approval by the West German cartel office , BSN said .
Birkel is West Germany 's second - biggest producer of pasta , with sales of 250 million marks -LRB- $ 133.4 million -RRB- in 1988 .
It has 750 workers at three production units in southwest Germany , and is that nation 's leading producer of pasta sauces .
The acquisition strengthens BSN 's position in the European pasta market .
The French group currently ranks second after Barilla Group of Italy , whose sales are chiefly in the Italian market .
United Biscuits -LRB- Holdings -RRB- PLC , a British food producer , announced the creation of a European group to bring together its trading interests in the region .
The new group will comprise all of United Biscuit 's manufacturing and marketing operations in the food sector apart from those based in the U.S. .
United Biscuits said the combined group , which will include businesses such as McVities biscuits and Terry 's confectionery , will have annual sales of more than # 1.5 billion -LRB- $ 2.35 billion -RRB- and trading profit of more than # 160 million -LRB- $ 251 million -RRB- .
`` The new structure will enable United Biscuits to focus clearly upon opportunities for planned growth during the 1990s , '' said Bob Clarke , deputy chairman and group chief executive .
Last month , United Biscuits agreed to sell its entire restaurant operations to Grand Metropolitan PLC for # 180 million .
We 're about to see if advertising works .
Hard on the heels of Friday 's 190 - point stock - market plunge and the uncertainty that 's followed , a few big brokerage firms are rolling out new ads trumpeting a familiar message : Keep on investing , the market 's just fine .
Their mission is to keep clients from fleeing the market , as individual investors did in droves after the crash in October
Just days after the 1987 crash , major brokerage firms rushed out ads to calm investors .
This time around , they 're moving even faster .
PaineWebber Inc. filmed a new television commercial at 4 p.m. EDT yesterday and had it on the air by last night .
Fidelity Investments placed new ads in newspapers yesterday , and wrote another new ad appearing today .
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. by yesterday afternoon had already written new TV ads .
It considered running them during tomorrow night 's World Series broadcast but decided not to when the market recovered yesterday .
Other brokerage firms , including Merrill Lynch & Co. , were plotting out potential new ad strategies .
The brokerage firms learned a lesson the last time around , when frightened investors flooded the phone lines and fled the market in a panic .
This time , the firms were ready .
Fidelity , for example , prepared ads several months ago in case of a market plunge .
When the market went into its free fall Friday afternoon , the investment firm ordered full pages in the Monday editions of half a dozen newspapers .
The ads touted Fidelity 's automated 800 - number beneath the huge headline , `` Fidelity Is Ready For Your Call . ''
A Fidelity spokesman says the 800 - line , which already was operating but which many clients did n't know about , received about double the usual volume of calls over the weekend .
`` A lot of investor confidence comes from the fact that they can speak to us , '' he says .
`` To maintain that dialogue is absolutely crucial .
It would have been too late to think about on Friday .
We had to think about it ahead of time . ''
Today 's Fidelity ad goes a step further , encouraging investors to stay in the market or even to plunge in with Fidelity .
Underneath the headline `` Diversification , '' it counsels , `` Based on the events of the past week , all investors need to know their portfolios are balanced to help protect them against the market 's volatility . ''
It goes on to plug a few diversified Fidelity funds by name .
PaineWebber also was able to gear up quickly thanks to the 1987 crash .
In the aftermath of the 1987 debacle , the brokerage firm began taping commercials in - house , ultimately getting its timing down fast enough to tape a commercial after the market closed and rush it on the air that night .
It also negotiated an arrangement with Cable News Network under which CNN would agree to air its last - minute creations .
The new PaineWebber commercial , created with ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi Co. , features Mary Farrell , one of the firm 's most visible investment strategists , sounding particularly bullish .
Taped just as the market closed yesterday , it offers Ms. Farrell advising , `` We view the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle ... .
We continue to feel that the stock market is still the place to be for long - term appreciation . ''
The spot was scheduled to appear three times on CNN last night .
PaineWebber considered an even harder sell , recommending specific stocks .
Instead , it settled on just urging the clients who are its lifeline to keep that money in the market .
`` We 're saying the worst thing that anyone can do is to see the market go down and dump everything , which just drives the prices down further , '' says John Lampe , PaineWebber 's director of advertising .
`` If you owned it and liked it Friday , the true value has n't changed . ''
He adds , `` This is n't 1987 revisited . ''
With the market fluctuating and then closing up more than 88 points yesterday , investment firms had to constantly revise their approach .
At Shearson Lehman , executives created potential new commercials Friday night and throughout the weekend , then had to regroup yesterday afternoon .
The plan had been to make one of Shearson 's easy - to - film , black - and - white `` Where We Stand '' commercials , which have been running occasionally in response to news events since 1985 .
The ad would have run during the World Series tomorrow , replacing the debut commercial of Shearson 's new ad campaign , `` Leadership by Example . ''
But in a meeting after the market closed yesterday , Shearson executives decided not to go ahead with the stock - market ad .
`` We do n't think at this point anything needs to be said .
The market seems to be straightening out ; we 're taking a wait - and - see attitude , '' says Cathleen B. Stewart , executive vice president of marketing .
In any case , the brokerage firms are clearly moving faster to create new ads than they did in the fall of 1987 .
But it remains to be seen whether their ads will be any more effective .
In 1987 , despite a barrage of ads from most of the major investment firms , individuals ran from the market en masse .
Now the firms must try their hardest to prove that advertising can work this time around .

ARNOLD ADVERTISING :
Edward Eskandarian , former chairman of Della Femina , McNamee WCRS / Boston , reached an agreement in principle to acquire a majority stake in Arnold Advertising , a small Boston shop .
Terms were n't disclosed .
Mr. Eskandarian , who resigned his Della Femina post in September , becomes chairman and chief executive of Arnold .
John Verret , the agency 's president and chief executive , will retain the title of president .
Separately , McDonald 's Corp. , Oak Brook , Ill. , named Arnold to handle its estimated $ 4 million cooperative ad account for the Hartford , Conn. , area .
That account had been handled by Della Femina , McNamee WCRS .
EDUCATION ADS :
A 142 - page ad supplement to Business Week 's special `` Corporate Elite '' issue calls on business leaders to use their clout to help solve the nation 's education crisis .
The supplement , the largest ever for the magazine , includes ads from 52 corporate advertisers and kicks off a two - year Business Week initiative on education .
The magazine will distribute 10 % of the gross revenues from the supplement as grants to innovative teachers .
The continuing series of HUD scandals is a sadly predictable result of pork - barrel politics .
Nevertheless , lobbies such as the National Association of Home Builders -LRB- NAHB -RRB- continue to pressure Capitol Hill for more special - interest spending .
Kent Colton , NAHB executive vice president , argues that the U.S. faces a multifaceted housing crisis -- reduced affordability of homes for first - time buyers , increased homelessness , and lower apartment construction rates -- that will be `` very difficult '' to solve `` without expanded federal resources . ''
There 's nothing unusual about business groups pushing for more government spending .
But the NAHB was created in 1943 out of an organization that made its name fighting a Roosevelt administration proposal to take over all defense housing production .
Through the years the association has been an active member of the taxpayer 's coalition , pushing for such initiatives as the balanced - budget amendment .
Yet on matters close to , er , home ...
`` The HUD budget has dropped by more than 70 % since 1980 , '' argues Mr. Colton .
`` We 've taken more than our fair share .
I would n't have a problem if other programs had taken a similar hit . ''
But NAHB support for subsidies is not related to the current housing crunch ; over the years the NAHB has backed a host of public programs .
It once pushed for a national housing production goal set by the federal government and has regularly advanced anti-recession housing measures .
Moreover , explains one HUD official , the NAHB remains susceptible to internal pressure from members that specialize in subsidized production .
The association is pushing an extensive and expensive wish - list , which would substantially boost spending above the current level of more than $ 15 billion annually .
It would like to peg the ceiling on Federal Housing Administration mortgage guarantees to 95 % of the median price in a particular market , instead of limiting it to $ 101,250 ; reduce -LRB- or even eliminate -RRB- FHA down - payment requirements and increase the availability of variable - rate mortgages ; expand the Veterans Affairs Department loan guarantee program ; provide `` adequate '' funding for the Farmers Home Administration -LRB- FmHA -RRB- ; increase federal funding and tax incentives for the construction of low - income and rental housing , including $ 4 billion in block grants to states and localities ; and `` fully fund '' the McKinney Act , a $ 656 million potpourri for the homeless .
Direct federal subsidies for housing construction have proved intolerably expensive in the past , and inevitably are twisted to the benefit of well - connected developers and lobbyists , as demonstrated by the ongoing HUD scandal , or congressmen .
Indirect subsidies , through the FHA , for instance , are little better .
Though Mr. Colton says expanding FHA lending would result in `` no cost to the government , '' the mere diversion of funds from other parts of the economy and from other forms of housing -LRB- such as low - income -RRB- to the single - family home market would result in a major expense .
More important , housing programs run by HUD , the VA , and FmHA are awash in red ink .
The FHA alone lost $ 4.2 billion in fiscal 1988 ; the government 's equity in the agency , essentially its reserve fund , fell to minus $ 2.9 billion .
The federal government has had to pump in $ 2.28 billion into the VA housing program since 1984 to keep the fund afloat and the VA requested an additional $ 120 million for the fiscal year just ended .
All told , the federal government already guarantees more than $ 900 billion of mortgages .
In its nicely produced publication `` Where Will Our Children Live ? '' the NAHB does acknowledge that `` of course , the full measure of housing affordability can not be provided by the federal government . ''
It points to the pernicious impact of local government regulation , particularly zoning and building fees , which pushes the price of housing out of the reach of low - and middle - income people .
But while the NAHB has suggested actions that states and localities should take to reduce regulatory barriers , the association has proposed no activist legislative program -- comparable to , say , its detailed request for more federal subsidies -- to eliminate counterproductive controls .
The association , a majority of whose 156,000 members build fewer than 25 units a year , is like many other business lobbies .
Explains Sheila MacDonald of the National Taxpayers Union : `` It treads in two worlds .
The builders like the subsidies , but at the same time they tend to be fiscal conservatives in terms of major issues , such as the balanced - budget amendment . ''
Unfortunately , the organization 's desire for pork tends to override its commitment to overall fiscal responsibility .
Two years ago when the NAHB lobbied for the $ 19 billion omnibus housing bill , the organization `` basically dropped out of the taxpayers ' coalition , '' says Ms. MacDonald .
As Mr. Colton of the NAHB acknowledges : `` Government is not going to solve the problem ... .
The real key is to have the economy working and interest rates down . ''
More money for HUD will increase the deficit and destabilize the economy ; more money to municipalities that are wrecking their local housing markets will further insulate them from the destructive effects of their policies .
Is this what the home builders want ?

What happened Friday shows that financial markets are not yet sufficiently coordinated to handle another meltdown in prices .
No fiddling with systems and procedures will ever prevent markets from suffering a panic wave of selling .
But markets can operate with greater or lesser efficiency .
After the 1987 plunge , markets agreed that it would be wise to halt trading whenever panic conditions arose .
The New York Stock Exchange adopted two specific circuit breakers : If the Dow Jones index falls 250 points in a day , the exchange will halt trading for one hour ; if the decline hits 400 points , the exchange will close for an additional two hours .
The rationale is that an interruption of trading will allow investors to reconsider their strategies , calm sellers and lead buyers to enter the market at indicated new price levels .
It is impossible to know whether that theory is realistic .
A temporary cessation of trading may indeed discourage a selling panic from feeding on itself .
But there is also the possibility that shutting down markets will intensify fears and cause an even more abrupt slide in prices .
What happened Friday was the worst of all worlds .
The futures exchanges followed their own pre-set circuit breakers and shut down at about 3 p.m. for 30 minutes , after the Standard & Poor 's 500 stock index had fallen 12 points , or about 100 points on the Dow Jones index .
Options markets stopped trading in many securities .
The New York Stock Exchange , under its own rules , remained open .
With nowhere else to go , sellers , and particularly program traders , focused all their selling on the New York Stock Exchange .
As liquidity on that market weakened , prices fell sharply .
Had the futures and options markets been open , additional liquidity would have been provided and the decline , most probably , would have been less intense .
At 3:30 , after intense telephone negotiations between the trading markets and Washington , the futures exchanges reopened .
Futures trading , however , was halted altogether at 3:45 , after the futures markets had dropped an additional 30 points , which is the daily limit for price declines .
At this point , the options markets also shut down and once more left all sales to be handled by the New York Stock Exchange .
It is time to recognize that the New York Stock Exchange , the futures markets and the options markets , though physically separate , have actually become so closely intertwined as to constitute one market effectively .
Traders can vary their strategies and execute their orders in any one of them .
It therefore makes no sense for each market to adopt different circuit breakers .
To achieve maximum liquidity and minimize price volatility , either all markets should be open to trading or none .
Synchronized circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on Friday , but they probably would have made for smoother , less volatile executions .
It 's time for the exchanges and the Securities and Exchange Commission to agree on joint conditions for halting trading or staying open .
Let 's not have one market shut down for 30 minutes when the Dow declines 100 points and another shut down for an hour after a 250 - point decline .
The need for hurried last - minute telephone negotiations among market officials will disappear once rules are in place that synchronize circuit breakers in all markets .
The new circuit breakers , if they are to be applied at all , will require that futures and options trading continue as long as the New York Stock Exchange remains open .
The rules should be established by agreement of the officials of all affected exchanges acting under the oversight and with the approval of the government regulatory agencies .
Should the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission -LRB- which , with the SEC , regulates the Chicago stock - index markets -RRB- be unable to agree , the issue may have to be resolved by decision of the Treasury secretary .
In many ways , our financial markets are better prepared today to handle a decline than they were two years ago .
The New York Stock Exchange now has the capacity to handle a volume of nearly a billion shares a day .
Telephone service has been improved for customers trying to reach their brokers , and specialists -- who I believe should stay , despite the urgings of some post-crash critics -- have larger capital positions .
-LRB- Of course , specialists ' actions alone can never prevent a major crack in stock prices .
Witness the fact that trading in some stocks closed early Friday and opened late Monday because of an excess of sell orders . -RRB-
But the task of improving market performance remains unfinished .

BMA Corp. , Kansas City , Mo. , said it 's weighing `` strategic alternatives , '' for its Business Men 's Assurance Co. unit , and is contacting possible buyers of the life and health insurance operation .
A BMA spokesman said `` runaway medical costs '' have made health insurance `` a significant challenge , '' and margins also have been pinched by changes in the mix of life - insurance products consumers now demand .
The Business Men 's Assurance unit represented about $ 288 million of the company 's $ 488 million in 1988 revenue , and the unit 's operating income was about $ 10 million , said the spokesman .
BMA 's investment banker , Alex . Brown & Sons Inc. , has been authorized to contact possible buyers for the unit .
Concerning your Sept. 19 article `` Wall Street Firms Link Analysts ' Pay to Performance , '' I 'm delighted that Wall Street is finally tuning in to the hard , cold facts of the real working world .
If the firms are serious , however , why limit the practice to the poor , maligned analysts whose ability to see into the future is fragile at best ?
Why not extend the same harsh standards to the sales force , and pay brokers a base salary with annual bonus based on how much money they made for their clients during the year ?
That should stop a lot of account - churning , and produce a stock market driven only by professional concern , careful thought and good sense .
Now , would n't that be a novelty .

West Germany 's Green Party joined its ideological soulmates Jeremy Rifkin and the Christic Institute in the legal battle to ground the Atlantis shuttle and its plutonium - powered Galileo probe to Jupiter .

A three - judge appeals panel yesterday refused to comply , though liberal Judge Pat Wald went out of her way to deny that this was a `` frivolous '' case .

J.P. Industries Inc. said it signed a definitive agreement to sell its Builders ' Hardware Group to closely held Nalcor Inc. of Beverly Hills , Calif .
Terms were n't disclosed , but a J.P. Industries spokesman said the amount J.P. Industries will get for the group is `` a little better than expected by the marketplace , and the marketplace had been expecting $ 25 million to $ 30 million . ''
The group consists of Weslock Corp. and JPI Modern Inc .
J.P. Industries , which is based in Ann Arbor , Mich. , said the sale completes a previously announced program to divest itself of its hardware and plumbing supplies operations .
The company 's remaining business is the manufacture and sale of engine and transmissions products for industrial and transportation applications .
A House - Senate conference approved a permanent smoking ban on all domestic airline routes within the continental U.S. and on all flights of six hours or less to Alaska and Hawaii .
The restrictions would cover all but a small percentage of domestic air traffic , and represent a major expansion of the current smoking ban on flights of two hours or less .
The exemption allowed on longer flights to Alaska and Hawaii appears to be largely a face - saving concession for the traditionally powerful tobacco industry , which has found itself increasingly isolated in the face of public pressure in recent years .
By a 6 - 4 margin , House negotiators initially rejected last night a Senate provision covering all domestic flights .
But the six - hour compromise was soon agreed to in subsequent discussions .
As a practical matter , flights from the West Coast to Hawaii would be covered as they are under the time limit , but the language would exempt longer routes beginning , for example , in Chicago or on the East Coast .
Within the Senate , the ban has had aggressive support from Sen. Frank Lautenberg -LRB- D. , N.J. -RRB- , who has used his position as a Senate Appropriations subcommittee chairman to garner votes for the initiative .
The measure is attached to the more than $ 26 billion fiscal 1990 transportation bill within Mr. Lautenberg 's jurisdiction , and the final compromise is laced with more than $ 205 million in road projects earmarked by members as well as funds sought by major airports , including Denver .
From the outset , the tobacco industry has been uncertain as to what strategy to follow .
But the industry retains support in the House leadership through the influence of grower states , such as North Carolina .
Majority Whip William Gray owes a political debt to Southern agriculture lawmakers for his rise in the House , and the Philadelphia Democrat used his position in the conference to salvage the exemption from a total ban .
Although the smoking provision has attracted the most public interest , the underlying bill was the subject of behind - the - scenes lobbying because of its impact on air transportation and the more mundane , but politically important , projects of members .
In a stark lesson in the power of the appropriations committees , the House deliberately killed a handful of projects backed by lawmakers in Florida , Illinois and Pennsylvania who had voted against the panel leadership on the House floor .
`` Anybody can vote as they want , '' said Rep. William Lehman -LRB- D. , Fla. -RRB- , head of the House conferees .
`` But if you make a request , you should support the committee . ''
Within the Federal Aviation Administration , the final bill promises to increase spending for facilities and equipment by more than 20 % from last year , and total operations would rise to $ 3.84 billion -- a 12 % boost .
The facilities account includes $ 40 million for Denver 's ambitious new airport , and the competition for these funds created shifting alliances between urban lawmakers representing established airports in Philadelphia and Michigan and the major carriers to Denver , United and Continental .
Leery of the costs -- and , critics say , competition -- the airlines have sought to gain leverage over the city of Denver .
Texas Air Corp. , which owns Continental , and the Air Transport Association were prominent in the lobbying .
The industry sought to impose conditions that would have delayed funds for the project until Denver and the airlines had agreed to leases for 50 % of the gates .
But this was rejected in favor of much looser language directing the Transportation Department to review the costs of the first phase , expected to cost about $ 2 billion .
Though smaller in total dollars , the conference agreed to preserve an estimated $ 30.6 million in controversial subsidies to carriers serving rural or isolated airports .
The sum is more than double what the House had approved for the program , but the list of qualified airports would be cut by 22 under new distance requirements and limits on the level of subsidy .
Congress previously cut six airports this year .
The impact of the changes is to eliminate many of the most excessive cases where the government has been paying more than $ 200 for each passenger in subsidies .
Among rail and highway accounts , the agreement provides $ 615 million for Amtrak , including $ 85 million for capital improvements .
And federal - formula grants for mass transit would be effectively frozen at $ 1.625 billion , or $ 20 million more than last fiscal year .
In an attempt to give new momentum to European Community plans for a single currency , EC government leaders are likely to agree to set a date for starting formal talks on amending the EC 's founding Treaty of Rome .
According to diplomatic sources in Brussels , most EC leaders agree that talks should begin in the second half of 1990 , and will make a declaration on that during a summit meeting in Strasbourg , France , on Dec. 8 and 9 .
The only strong opposition to changing the EC treaty comes from British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , who is opposed to creating a single EC currency .
But the process of convening the intergovernmental conference does n't require unanimity .
Setting a date to start treaty negotiations has no legal significance in itself , but could be viewed as an important psychological push .
French President Francois Mitterrand fought to set a date for the conference during the EC summit in Madrid last June , but the move was scuttled because of opposition by Mrs. Thatcher and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl .
Diplomatic sources said Mr. Kohl may now agree to set a date for the conference to make it clear that West Germany is still committed to EC unity .
The sudden `` flight to quality '' that triggered Friday 's explosive bond - market rally was reversed yesterday in a `` flight from quality '' rout .
The setback , in which Treasury bond prices plummeted , reflected a rebound in the stock market and profit - taking .
`` It was a pretty wild day .
Our markets were closely tied to the stock market , '' said Joel Kazis , manager of trading at Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co .
`` Friday 's flight to quality was no longer needed once the stock market found its legs , '' he said .
Some fixed - income investors had expected a further drop in stock prices after the nearly 200 - point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Friday .
That caused investors to flee stocks and buy high - quality Treasury bonds , which are safer than other types of securities .
But when stocks began to climb instead , prices of Treasury bonds declined .
Contributing to the selling pressure were dispatches by several investment firms advising clients to boost their stock holdings and reduce the size of their cash or bond portfolios .
Among the firms were Merrill Lynch & Co. and Dean Witter Reynolds Inc .
The bond market seemed to ignore evidence that the Federal Reserve eased credit conditions slightly by allowing the federal funds rate to drift as low as 8 1/2 % .
The closely watched rate on federal funds , or overnight loans between banks , slid to about 8 3/4 % last week , down from its perceived target level of about 9 % .
The rate is considered an early signal of changes in Fed policy .
Traders said yesterday 's modest easing did n't stir much enthusiasm because it had been widely expected .
In fact , some economists contend that the latest easing started last week .
Others note that some investors were disappointed because they had expected a more aggressive easing .
The Treasury 's benchmark 30 - year bond , ended about 1 3/4 points lower , or down about $ 17.50 for each $ 1,000 face amount .
The reversal was even more evident among shorter - term Treasury securities .
After Treasury bill rates plummeted as much as 0.70 percentage point on Friday , they gave back three - fourths of that amount yesterday .
The bond - equivalent yield on three - month Treasury bills , for example , was quoted late yesterday at 7.72 % , compared with 7.16 % Friday .
Investment - grade corporate bonds , mortgage - backed securities and municipal bonds also fell .
But prices of junk bonds , which were battered Friday in near standstill trading , rebounded to post small gains after a volatile trading session .
Junk bonds opened as much as four points lower but staged a modest comeback as stock prices firmed .
Some traders said the high - yield market was helped by active institutional buying .
In particular , they said , firms such as First Boston Corp. and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. began making a market in junk issues early in the session when prices hit severely depressed levels .
`` I think the willingness of securities companies to make markets for high - yield issues improved the sentiment for junk bonds , '' said John Lonski , an economist at Moody 's Investors Service Inc .
U.S. Treasury bonds were higher in overnight trading in Japan , which opened at about 7:30 p.m. EDT .
The benchmark 30 - year bond , for example rose one point in early Japanese trading in reaction to a quick 600 - point drop in the Tokyo stock market .
But as Japanese stocks rebounded , Treasurys retreated and ended just modestly higher .
Many U.S. trading operations , wanting to keep a watchful eye on Japanese trading as an indication of where U.S. trading would begin , were fully staffed during the Tokyo trading session .
`` Most of the action was during the night session , '' said Michael Moore , trading manager at Continental Bank .
Jay Goldinger , who often trades overnight for Capital Insight Inc. , Beverly Hills , Calif. , said trading in Tokyo was `` very active '' but highly volatile .
`` We went down 3/4 point in 10 minutes right before lunch , then after lunch we went up 3/4 point in 12 minutes , '' he said .
In Tokyo , trading is halted during lunchtime .
Tokyo 's market turned out to be a bad bellwether for U.S. trading .
When the market opened here , bonds prices fell as the stock market regained strength .
The bond market 's focus on stock activity was so strong yesterday that it overshadowed today 's slate of economic data , which includes the government 's report on August U.S. merchandise trade and September industrial production .
Industrial production is expected to have declined 0.2 % , according to a consensus of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report .
The August trade deficit is expected to have widened to $ 9.1 billion from $ 7.58 billion in July .
A widening of that magnitude , said one New York trader , is `` not a favorable number ... .
It could do damage to us . ''
Meanwhile , agency supply is expected to weigh heavily on the market today when the Federal Home Loan Bank prices a $ 2.3 billion offering of one - year , three - year , five - year and 10 - year maturities .
Tomorrow , the Resolution Funding Corp. will provide details of its first bond issue , which is expected to total between $ 4 billion and $ 6 billion and carry a maturity greater than 20 years .
Resolution Funding is a division of Resolution Trust Corp. , the new federal agency created to bail out the nation 's troubled thrifts .
And this week the Tennessee Valley Authority plans to price a $ 3 billion offering , its first public debt borrowing in 15 years .
`` There 's lots of supply , '' the New York trader said .
`` We have a couple or three tough weeks coming . ''
Treasury Securities
Prices of Treasury bonds tumbled in moderate to active trading .
The benchmark 30 - year Treasury bond was quoted late at a price of 101 19/32 , compared with a closing price of 103 12/32 Friday .
The yield on the benchmark issue rose to 7.97 % from 7.82 % .
The latest 10 - year notes were quoted late at 100 3/32 for a yield of 7.97 % , compared with 101 9/32 to yield 7.84 % .
Short - term interest rates fell yesterday at the government 's weekly Treasury bill auction .
The average discount rate on new three - month Treasury bills was 7.37 % , the lowest since the average of 7.36 % at the auction on Oct. 17 , 1988 .
The average discount rate was 7.42 % on new six - month bills , the lowest since the average of 7.35 % at the auction on July 31 , 1989 .
Here are auction details :
Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value .
Thus , higher bidding narrows the investor 's return while lower bidding widens it .
The percentage rates are calculated on a 360 - day year , while the coupon - equivalent yield is based on a 365 - day year .
Both issues are dated Oct. 19 .
The 13 - week bills mature Jan. 18 , 1990 , and the 26 - week bills mature April 19 , 1990 .
Corporate Issues
Investment - grade corporate bonds ended one to 1 1/2 point lower .
There were no new issues .
Foreign Bonds
Foreign bonds surged as the dollar weakened against most major currencies .
Among benchmark issues : -- Japan 's No. 111 4.6 % bond due 1998 ended on brokers screens at 96.15 , up 1.17 point .
The yield was 5.245 % .
-- West Germany 's 6 3/4 % issue due June 1999 ended at 98.30 , up 0.91 point to yield 6.99 % .
-- Britain 's 11 3/4 % bond due 2003/2007 ended 1 1/8 higher at 111 19/32 to yield 10.12 % , while the 11 3/4 % notes due 1991 rose 21/32 to 98 26/32 to yield 12.74 % .
Mortgage - Backed Securities
Mortgage securities gave up most of Friday 's gains as active issues ended 24/32 to 30/32 point lower .
Dealers said morning activity was hectic as prices dropped in response to gains in the stock market and losses in Treasury securities , but trading slowed to moderate levels in the afternoon .
Government National Mortgage Association 9 % securities for November delivery were quoted late yesterday at 98 4/32 , down 30/32 from Friday ; 9 1/2 % securities were down 27/32 at 100 5/32 ; and 10 % securities were at 102 2/32 , off 24/32 .
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9 % securities were at 97 1/4 , down 3/4 .
On Friday , mortgage issues gained as much as 1 5/32 .
Late yesterday Ginnie Mae 9 % securities were yielding 9.39 % to a 12 - year average life assumption , as the spread above the Treasury 10 - year note narrowed 0.01 percentage point to 1.42 .
Traders said there were some busy dealings in Freddie Mac and Federal National Mortgage Association securities because underwriters from last week 's heavy slate of real estate mortgage investment conduit issues moved to gather collateral for new deals .
Offsetting the Remic - related purchases were continued heavy sales by mortgage originators , which are producing increased amounts of fixed - rate mortgage - backed issues with lower rates .
There was no new - issue activity in the derivative market .
Municipals
Rebounding stocks and weaker Treasury prices drove municipal bonds 1/4 to 3/4 point lower in late dealings .
The session losses left municipal dollar bonds close to where they were before the 190.58 - point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average Friday prompted a capital markets rally .
Trading was hectic during the morning , with players trying to gauge whether equities would continue Friday 's free fall or stabilize after a brief spot of weakness .
Tax - exempts started the session flat to a touch higher on anticipation of further stock market erosion , but bond prices rapidly turned south as it became more clear that a repeat of the October 1987 crash was n't at hand .
Professionals dominated municipal trading throughout the session .
Traders said retail investors seemed to be hugging the sidelines until a measure of volatility is wrung out of the market .
New Jersey Turnpike Authority 's 7.20 % issue of 2018 was off 3/4 at 98 1/2 bid , yielding 7.32 % , up 0.07 percentage point from late Friday .
Florida Board of Education 's 7 1/4 % issue of 2023 was 5/8 point weaker at 99 1/2 bid .
The 7 1/8 % issue of Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority of New York , due 2019 , was off 5/8 at 98 1/8 bid .
And Fairfax County , Va. , Water Authority 's 7 1/4 % issue of 2027 was down 3/4 at 99 7/8 bid .
Serial bond yields were up about 0.05 percentage point .
Chicken Chains Ruffled By Loss of Customers
FAST - FOOD chicken chains , faced with a worsening business slump , are struggling to hatch some new marketing strategies .
The Crest Report , which tracks consumer purchases , says customer traffic at chicken restaurants fell 10 % in the second quarter , while the overall fast - food customer count was down 2 % .
Chicken business is off largely because of more competition from grocery - store convenience food , home - delivered pizza and other takeout fare , says a spokesman for the report , a publication of NPD Group , a market research firm in Port Washington , N.Y .
The loss of more customers is the latest in a string of problems .
Church 's Fried Chicken Inc. and Popeye 's Famous Fried Chicken Inc. , which have merged , are still troubled by overlapping restaurant locations .
Chicken chains also are feeling more pressure from McDonald 's Corp. , which introduced its McChicken sandwich this year and recently tested the sale of individual pieces of chicken .
New management at Kentucky Fried Chicken , a unit of PepsiCo Inc. , has fought back with new medium and large chicken sandwiches for the lunch crowd .
And the chain is testing products that are n't fried , such as `` char - grilled '' chicken , to try to win health - conscious consumers .
Kentucky Fried Chicken also is testing home - delivery of chicken , which could be a hit with stay - at - home diners .
But some fast - food industry analysts say problems with keeping chicken warm and fresh must be solved first .
A Kentucky Fried Chicken spokesman , however , disputed the notion that the delivery service experienced problems in some markets where testing has been discontinued .
He says the test is continuing in Chicago , Columbus , Ohio , and a few other cities .
The advertising industry is buzzing with rumors that Kentucky Fried Chicken will drop Young & Rubicam and seek a new ad agency .
But the company declines to comment .
Emanuel Goldman , a PaineWebber Inc. analyst , predicts Kentucky Fried Chicken will post an 11 % drop in 1989 net income .
`` They 've been laggard , '' he says , `` but they 'll have to become more aggressive . ''
Reluctant Advertisers Try Soft - Sell Spots
CALL IT un-advertising .
Pittsburgh consultant David Bear is selling a soft approach to clients who want exposure yet shun pushy ads .
His ploy : 60 - second radio spots that offer helpful hints .
The only plug for the sponsor is a brief mention at the end of the spot .
The messages resemble the Business Traveler , a daily dose of travel tips developed by Mr. Bear and sponsored by travel agencies in several major cities .
New un-advertisers include Burt Hill Kosar Rittlemann Associates , a Butler , Pa. , architectural firm .
Its radio series features such spots as `` Floodlights : Evening Wear for Urban Structures '' and `` Building a Place to Park . ''
A harder sell , says John Kosar , the firm 's president , would `` detract from the profession . ''
Hospitals have signed up to use the messages to promote fundraisers , and Equitable Gas Co. is considering the format to offer energy tips to consumers .
But such spots can be too soft .
`` There 's always a risk of lost messages , '' says John Fitzgerald , chairman of Ketchum Advertising USA , which created similar radio spots for Pittsburgh National Bank .
`` It 's a question of how much credibility you gain for the possible loss of recognition . ''
Retailer Sees Pitfalls In Environmental Push
HERE 'S a retailer that 's getting tough in the push for environmentally safe packaging and products .
Big Bear Supermarkets Inc. , a grocery chain based in San Diego , plans to display shelf cards and distribute pamphlets recommending products deemed safe for the environment .
The choices will be based on research by the San Diego Environmental Health Coalition and will include products like Murphy 's Oil Soap and other noncorrosive cleaners .
But the chain is quickly realizing the pitfalls of such endorsements .
For example , it recommends nonchlorinated dishwasher detergent and puts Sunlight on its environmentally safe list .
That does n't thrill Procter & Gamble Co. , maker of Cascade dishwasher detergent .
A company spokesman questioned the validity of the list , noting that chlorine is present in all major dishwasher detergents .
In fact , Lever Bros. confirms that its Sunlight brand does contain chlorine bleach , even though it is n't listed on the label for the powder version .
Thomas G. Dahlen , Big Bear 's executive vice president , said the chain is still reviewing its product list to avoid such problems .
`` Our intent is to promote the best alternative , '' he says .
`` And it 's important that we be accurate . ''
But in the end , customers ' wishes are what will prevail .
Big Bear does n't care for disposable diapers , which are n't biodegradable .
Yet parents demand them .
Says Mr. Dahlen , `` We 'll still be forced to sell items we might not philosophically agree with . ''

Gitano Group Inc. said it agreed to buy 50 % of Regatta Sport Ltd. , a closely held apparel maker , with the assumption of $ 3 million of contingent debt .
Under the terms of the contract , New York - based Gitano has the option to acquire the remaining 50 % of Regatta , a maker of men 's and women 's clothes sold primarily in department stores , under certain conditions .
That 50 % is now held by Clifford Parker , Regatta 's president and chief executive officer , who will continue to manage Regatta 's operations under Gitano .
In 1989 , Regatta will have sales `` in excess of $ 10 million '' and will show a profit , Mr. Parker said .
Gitano , which makes budget - priced apparel sold mainly through mass merchandisers like K mart and Wal - Mart , said the Regatta acquisition will enhance its strategy to expand into department stores .
This fall , Gitano began manufacturing moderately priced clothes aimed at department stores under the Gloria Vanderbilt trademark , which Gitano recently acquired .
Maxus Energy Corp. , Dallas , said it discovered a new oil field northeast of its previously discovered Intan Field in the southeast Sumatra area of Indonesia .
Maxus said it did n't run a production test on the three discovery wells it drilled in the field , which is about 1.6 miles from the Intan Field , because the wells are similar to others drilled at its Intan and Widuri fields .
However , Maxus said it believes the reserves in the field are about 10 million barrels of oil .
The Intan Field has estimated reserves of 50 million barrels and the Widuri Field has estimated reserves of 225 million barrels .
Maxus , an independent oil and gas concern , is the operator and owns a 56 % interest in the new field , called Northeast Intan .
Other interests are owned by BP Petroleum Development -LRB- SES -RRB- Ltd. , C. Itoh Energy Co. Ltd. , Deminex Sumatra OEL G.m.b . H. , Hispanoil -LRB- Sumatra -RRB- Production Ltd. , Hudbay Oil -LRB- Indonesia -RRB- Ltd. , Inpex Sumatra Co. Ltd. , Lasmo Sumatra Ltd. , Sunda Shell , TCR Sumat A.G. and Warrior Oil Co .
The production - sharing contract area is held with Pertamina , the Indonesian state oil company .
Whirlpool Corp. , Benton Harbor , Mich. , said it has developed a process to recover environmentally harmful chlorofluorocarbons , or CFCs , that previously entered the atmosphere during in - home repair of refrigerators and freezers .
The maker of home appliances said the process , which involves the use of a multilayer plastic bag during repairs to capture the gaseous substance and transport it to a recycling center , is already in use at a number of its service centers , and will be available to all authorized repair centers by spring .
Earlier repairs vented the CFCs out of the home through a hose directly into the atmosphere .
CFCs are widely used as solvents , coolants and fire suppressants .
But their use has been linked to a potentially dangerous depletion of the Earth 's ozone layer , and a number of companies are seeking to curtail use , or at least emission , of the substance .
Whirpool said , `` We see this process as a small but important step toward eventual elimination of CFC use in appliance manufacture .

The Communications Workers of America ratified a new regional contract and all but one of the local agreements with Bell Atlantic Corp .
CWA 's New Jersey Commercial local , which represents about 2,500 service representatives and marketing employees , rejected the tentative agreement .
Both the union and the regional telephone company said they were working together to resolve differences .
The new three - year contracts , which replace ones that expired Aug. 5 , cover 41,000 Bell Atlantic employees .
The ratification follows a 23 - day strike against the Philadelphia - based company .
Meanwhile , CWA and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers members remain on strike against Nynex Corp. , the New York - based regional phone company .
The unions and the company last week agreed to mediation .
The CWA represents 40,000 Nynex workers and the IBEW represents 20,000 workers .
Nintendo Co. , a Japanese maker of video games , electronic information systems and playing cards , posted a 23 % unconsolidated surge in pretax profit to 61.41 billion yen -LRB- $ 429 million -RRB- from 50 billion yen -LRB- $ 349.9 million -RRB- for the fiscal year ended Aug. 31 .
Sales surged 40 % to 250.17 billion yen from 178.61 billion .
Net income rose 11 % to 29.62 billion yen from 26.68 billion .
Pershare net fell to 423.3 yen from 457.7 yen because of expenses and capital adjustments .
Without detailing specific product breakdowns , Nintendo credited its bullish upsurge in sales -- including advanced computer games and television entertainment systems -- to surging `` leisure - oriented '' sales in foreign markets .
Export sales for leisure items alone , for instance , totaled 184.74 billion yen in the 12 months , up from 106.06 billion in the previous fiscal year .
Domestic leisure sales , however , were lower .
While Friday 's plunging stock market prompted new fears about the economy 's prospects , a little - known indicator that has faithfully foreshadowed the economy 's ups and downs by exceptionally long lead times points to a sustained rise in overall business activity .
The barometer , developed by analysts at Columbia University 's Center for International Business Cycle Research here , reached a record high of 223.0 in August , the latest month available , and the Columbia researchers estimate that it has moved even higher since then .
The latest reading of 223.0 was up from 222.3 in July and 215.3 as recently as March .
The August rise marked the fifth straight monthly gain for the indicator , which uses the 1967 average as a base of 100 .
In contrast , the Commerce Department 's widely followed index of leading indicators , while up in August , has fallen repeatedly since reaching a high early this year .
Its ragged behavior through much of 1989 has prompted some forecasters to anticipate the start of a new recession perhaps before year 's end .
But the far stronger showing of the Columbia index `` makes a recession any time soon highly unlikely , '' says Geoffrey H. Moore , the director of the Columbia facility .
A leading authority on the business cycle , Mr. Moore also is a member of the Business Cycle Dating Group , the panel of private economists that decides for the government when expansions and recessions begin and end .
The group normally convenes only when a change in the economy 's general course seems likely .
`` No meeting is scheduled because the expansion shows no sign of going off the tracks , '' Mr. Moore reports .
Based largely on the recent strength in their index , called the long leading indicator , the Columbia analysts foresee uninterrupted economic growth through the rest of this year and next year as well .
They expect a 2.6 % rise in 1990 in the gross national product , after adjustment for inflation .
Underlying this optimism is the index 's longstanding ability to signal recessions or recoveries , as the case may be , by substantially greater periods than the Commerce Department 's index of leading indicators .
Over the full post-World War II era , the Columbia index , on the average , has entered sustained declines 14 months before the onset of recessions and turned up eight months before recoveries .
The comparable lead times for the Commerce index , whose components include the stock market , are far shorter -- 10 months before recessions and only three months before recoveries .
The Columbia economists also have reconstructed how the long leading index would have behaved , had it existed , in 1929 , before the stock market crash in October that ushered in the Great Depression .
The indicator reached a peak in January 1929 and then fell steadily up to and through the crash .
`` It was an entirely different pattern from what we 're seeing now , '' Mr. Moore says .
A major source of the recent strength in the long leading indicator has been the performance of the Dow Jones corporate bond - price index , which is not a part of the Commerce index .
In August , the bond measure was at its highest monthly average since early 1987 .
It also rose last Friday , while the stock market sagged .
Other components of the long leading indicator include a ratio of prices to unit labor costs in manufacturing industries , the M2 version of the money supply , adjusted for inflation , and the volume of new home - building permits .
Notably absent from the Columbia index is the stock market , which Mr. Moore says `` is simply no longer such a good indicator of the economy 's long - range prospects , though it still is useful for anticipating some short - run twists and turns . ''
As recently as 1975 , the stock market -- as reflected in the Standard & Poor 's index of 500 common stocks -- was rated by the National Bureau of Economic Research as the best of the 12 leading indicators that then made up the Commerce index .
It was assigned a mark of 80 out of a possible 100 , compared with scores ranging as low as 69 for the other components .
The stock market has lost some precursory power , analysts at the Columbia center claim , because of the growing impact of international developments .
`` Stocks have become more sensitive to factors not directly tied to the domestic economy , '' Mr. Moore says , citing the exchange rate for the dollar on currency markets , the foreign - trade balance and inflows of foreign capital .
He also feels that the rise of such computer - based practices as program trading has diminished the stock market 's relevancy to the economic outlook .
An American journalist now is standing trial in Namibia .
This is the place that world opinion has been celebrating over in the expectation that it 's going to hold an election .
The most likely winner will be the Marxist - dominated SWAPO rebels .
The U.S. journalist 's `` crime '' was writing that the head of the commission charged with overseeing the election 's fairness , Bryan O'Linn , was openly sympathetic to SWAPO .
Shortly after that , Mr. O'Linn had Scott Stanley arrested and his passport confiscated .
Mr. Stanley is on trial over charges that he violated a proclamation , issued by the South African administrator general earlier this year , which made it a crime punishable by two years in prison for any person to `` insult , disparate or belittle '' the election commission .
The Stanley affair does n't bode well for the future of democracy or freedom of anything in Namibia when SWAPO starts running the government .
To the extent Mr. Stanley has done anything wrong , it may be that he is out of step with the consensus of world intellectuals that the Namibian guerrillas were above all else the victims of suppression by neighboring South Africa .
SWAPO has enjoyed favorable Western media treatment ever since the U.N. General Assembly declared it the `` sole , authentic representative '' of Namibia 's people in
Last year , the U.S. brokered a peace settlement to remove Cuba 's `` Afrika Korps '' from Angola and hold `` free and fair '' elections that would end South Africa 's control of Namibia .
The elections are set for Nov. 7 .
In July , Mr. Stanley , editor of American Press International , a Washington D.C. - based conservative wire service , visited Namibia to report on the U.N. - monitored election campaign .
He interviewed Mr. O'Linn , head of a commission charged with investigating electoral intimidation , and reported that Mr. O'Linn was openly sympathetic to SWAPO and indeed had defended its leaders in court .
After Mr. Stanley 's article was published in two Namibian newspapers , Mr. O'Linn had criminal charges brought against their editors , publisher and lawyer .
Mr. Stanley was arrested and charged along with the others when he returned to Namibia this month .
Both the State Department and the Lawyers Committee for Freedom of the Press have protested Mr. Stanley 's detention .
Mr. Stanley 's arrest is the latest in a series of incidents that threaten to derail Namibia 's elections .
Both South African and SWAPO extremists are intimidating voters .
The U.S. is in the habit of arranging peace settlements and then washing its hands over the tragic results .
It now has the chance to redress that record in Namibia .
State and the human - rights community should insist that Mr. Stanley and his fellow defendants be released and that the United Nation 's monitors make certain that Mr. O'Linn's commission investigates election complaints from all sides .
Frank Lloyd Wright is reported to have said once that if you tipped the world on its side , everything loose would end up in California .
We 've always thought that Mr. Wright underestimated California 's vitality , but maybe the state 's la - la factions are starting to overwhelm the forces that made it such a significant place .
What else is one to make of the whacky save - the - earth initiative just proposed by several major environmental groups and organized by the state 's attorney general ?
If passed by the voters , the recently announced initiative would phase out major pesticides , reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 40 % , ban new offshore drilling , ban chemicals thought to deplete the ozone layer , and create a new state environmental officer armed with a $ 40 million budget to sue any firm or agency he thinks is being too dirty .
The initiative is based largely on the wish - lists of the green lobby : the Sierra Club , the League of Conservation Voters , the Natural Resources Defense Council , the National Toxics Campaign and the Citizens for a Better Environment .
Interestingly , the Environmental Defense Fund is having nothing to do with this one .
Not only Californians but all Americans would pay if this thing passed .
The initiative bars the sale of any crops in California that do n't meet the initiative 's standards .
Kansas wheat farmers and Florida fruit growers would have to adjust or give up the California market .
In other words , California is presuming to take control of the nation 's farm policy .
As usual the green lobby 's proposal is disconnected from scientific reality .
Consider the greenhouse - effect provision .
The proposed initiative would mandate a reduction of carbon dioxide of 40 % .
Even if one buys into the whole greenhouse theory , it is inconceivable that reductions in a single state could have any impact on what is billed as a global problem .
But if rational science and economics have nothing to do with the new environment initiative , what is going on ?
The first place to look under these circumstances is at the ways in which the sponsors themselves will benefit .
The key here is the ambition of state Attorney General John Van de Kamp .
He 's running for governor .
Mr. Van de Kamp is the one who collected the plans from the various radical environmental groups and cobbled them into a single unwieldy initiative to be placed on the ballot for election on Nov. 6 , 1990 .
That 's also the day of the gubernatorial election .
The initiative seems to have been crafted to include all the hot issues that set off the wealthy Hollywood weepers who donate money .
And it allows Mr. Van de Kamp to get around campaign spending limits .
He can spend the legal maximum for his campaign ; all the spending for the Van de Kamp initiative -LRB- on which there are no limits -RRB- is gravy .
This initiative is being labeled The Big Green , but maybe it should be called The Big Greenback .
-LRB- The Republican candidate , Sen. Pete Wilson , is playing the initiative fundraising game too , sponsoring his own crime initiative . -RRB-
While it is possible that the Big Green initiative will be ruled unconstitutional , it is of course conceivable that in modern California it could slide through .
This is the state that recently passed the Prop. 65 anti-toxic initiative .
If this new proposal ever does become law , the green lobby will benefit directly .
The initiative creates a free floating state environmental officer to sue companies or government agencies that do things he does n't like .
That means the NRDC and such groups no longer would have to spend as much money on litigation ; taxpayers would bear the cost .
Mr. Van de Kamp and his allies may be hoping that the environment is such a mom and apple - pie issue among certain segments of California 's population now that almost any collection of anti-scientific , anti-pocketbook nonsense can pass under its rubric .
Of course the state 's liberals are not yet a nation unto themselves .
George Bush , for example , may decide that he does n't want to be the President who lost control of interstate commerce to an attorney general from California .
And some other segments of California 's political and media culture may yet start to point out that the initiative would impose significant costs on the state 's less affluent citizens in the form of higher food prices and lost jobs .
This grandiose initiative will help California define itself for the future either as a state still tethered to economic and scientific reality , or as one being led to wherever its la - la activists want to take it .
Ambassador Paul Nitze 's statement -LRB- Notable & Quotable , Sept. 20 -RRB- , `` If you have a million people working for you , every bad thing that has one chance in a million of going wrong will go wrong at least once a year , '' is a pretty negative way of looking at things .
Is n't it just as fair to say that if you have a million people working for you , every good thing that has one chance in a million of going right will go right at least once a year ?
Do n't be such a pessimist , Mr. Ambassador .

Ankara , November 30 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- Turkish Minister of State Kursad Tuzmen stated here today , Thursday , that the European Union has to accept Turkey 's membership , according to local media reports .
Tuzmen made this announcement at a meeting he attended with the Turkish Labor and Social Security Minister , Murat Basesgioglu , in Ankara .
Tuzmen noted that Turkey was still a candidate member of the European Union , and that the membership process was subject to ups and downs .
" We have to focus on how Turkey 's standards can exceed European Union standards , " he added .
" The European Union will guarantee its own future if it accepts Turkey as a member , " Tuzmen added .
" In fact , we do not have to exert too much effort " he said .
" We will show the European Union that Turkey will not make concessions in its legitimate issues , "
Tuzmen asserted that the European Union has to accept Turkey , because a large percentage of its population is under the age of thirty .
Besides , it provides security in energy and other security issues of the European Union .
On Wednesday , the European Union recommended a partial suspension of the entry talks with Turkey , because Ankara had resisted opening its airports and harbors for traffic from the Greek Cypriot administration .
The European Union said that talks on 8 of the 35 policy areas or " chapters " related to the free movement of goods , financial services , agriculture , fishing , transportation policy , customs union policy , and external relations issues , should be suspended .
The European Union executive body said that the other chapters could be opened , but the temporary closure of these chapters would depend on Turkey 's fulfillment of opening its airports and harbors to Greek Cypriot traffic .
The Cypriot government today , Monday , blamed " Ankara 's negative position " for the failure of the last - minute discussions that took place in Finland with the purpose of avoiding a crisis between the European Union and Ankara over the divided island of Cyprus .
Cypriot Foreign Minister George Lillikas said in a written statement : " Unfortunately , and in spite of our good intentions and the good efforts of the Finnish Presidency , it was not possible to reach an agreement because , as is the case with any agreement , it requires the good intentions of all the concerned parties . "
Lillikas and his Turkish counterpart Abdullah Gul held separate discussions in Tampere , Finland , with their Finnish counterpart Erkki Tuomioja prior to the summit of European foreign ministers and Mediterranean Basin countries -LRB- EuroMed -RRB- .
Following the discussions , the Finnish Foreign Minister Tuomioja announced that the discussions had failed .
The Minister , whose country currently holds the presidency of the European Union , said to reporters : " It was not possible to reach an agreement . "
At the end of September , Finland presented a plan to resume direct trading between the European Union and the Turkish Cypriot community in the north of the island in exchange for Turkey 's consent to open its ports and airports to Greek Cypriot ships and planes .
In July 2005 , Turkey had signed a protocol expanding its customs union with the European Union to include the ten countries that joined the Union in 2004 .
However , Ankara refuses to apply this protocol to the Republic of Cyprus , demanding as a prior condition the lifting of the ban imposed on the " Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus " which is recognized only by Turkey .
The Finns gave Ankara until the 6th of next December to open its ports and airports to Cyprus , otherwise the Union would discuss the possibility of freezing , at least partially , its membership negotiations that began in October 2005 .
The Palestinian situation has never been worse than it is at the present time , in spite of everything the Palestinians have lived through over a period of a century , with its crises and ordeals , its suffering , wars and catastrophes .
Given his responsibilities and powers , it was not possible for the president of the Palestinian Authority , Mahmoud Abbas , to postpone yet again the vital decisions he needs to take to find a peaceful , democratic way out of this all - encompassing and violent crisis which is asphyxiating the Palestinians and threatening their security and the security of their children , preventing them from providing the bare essentials for life to continue , whether it be a loaf of bread or a sip of milk or a medicine tablet .
Everything that Abbas ' government says about the economic blockade is completely correct and true .
It is an oppressive blockade that punishes the Palestinian people for their democratic choice and is based on double standards , all this is perfectly true , but what is the point of continuing to denounce and condemn this oppressive blockade a thousand million times without trying , even once for the sake of God and the country , to find an exit or solution to this crisis , even if the matter requires us to step down a little from the seats of power which are , in essence , no more than an autonomous authority under the hegemony of direct Israeli military occupation , and in the light of the Western sponsor countries ' pre-set conditions . .
Informed sources mentioned that former President Amin Gemayel gave verbal testimony yesterday before Military Investigation Judge Adnan Bulbul on the crime of the assassination of his son , Pierre Gemayel , on last October 21st .
The sources mentioned that Gemayel did not directly accuse any person or agency of assassinating his son , but he outlined political incidents that had taken place in the country that might be one of the reasons for the assassination , or the most important of them .
Judge Bulbul is expected to decide , in the light of Gemayel 's testimony , whether he will listen to other family members ' testimonies in the same dossier .
The sources talked about the many pieces of information and data available for the investigation , yet translating them into compelling evidence that would lead to exposing those who committed the crime requires some time .
Sources said that the investigation was still at the stage of interviewing witnesses , and that Judge Bulbul summoned a number of people for a session that he would hold tomorrow in order to hear their testimonies in that regard .
A meeting was held in the house of President Gemayel in Sin Al Feel , which included General Prosecutor of the Cassation , Judge Said Mirza , the Government Commissioner of the Military Tribunal , Judge Jan Fahd , and the Investigation Judge , Ghassan Bulbul .
The judges informed President Gemayel of the latest findings of the investigations into the assassination of Minister Gemayel .
President Gemayel expressed his wish " that the road will be opened , since there is no more need for investigation of the crime scene , especially as this is a time of festivities , in order to facilitate citizen movement in the area , since the martyr Gemayel in his lifetime looked forward to the rise of Lebanon and the need to look to the future . "
It was reported that the judiciary would give instructions for the removal of vehicles from the middle of the street in preparation to reopen it to traffic .

Today , the Association of the Relationship between the Two Sides of the Straits sent a letter to the Foundation for the Exchange across the Straits to exchange views on the matters of life and property loss of mainland compatriots and Taiwanese compatriots .
The communique said that on April 12th the Straits Association director expressed that the Straits Association agreed in principle , after both sides implement necessary preparations , to exchange views about the matter of contact and exchange between both sides of the Straits concerning life and property loss of mainland compatriots and Taiwanese compatriots in recent years .
The Straits Association holds that , now , both sides should first agree on topics and content of exchanging views , and then come back to consider issues such as staff levels and time , place , etc .
If both sides can not reach an agreement on topics and content , it would not be possible to find common points in exchanging views .
This type of discussion is not what compatriots from both sides are happy to see .
The Straits Association believes that the content of the exchange of views should include :
Firstly , to exchange views on the issues of tourism and contact on both sides of the Straits , including travel safety issues of compatriots from both sides .
As early as the first working discussion , at the end of August of last year , when the two associations implemented the " Wang - Gu Talks " , the Straits Association put forward in the " schedule for the discussion on implementing relevant agreements of the Wang - Gu Talks " that the associations should conduct specific discussions about " issues on strengthening tourism and contact on both sides " as soon as possible , but so far the Straits Foundation 's response has not been received .
Secondly , the Straits Association persistently advocates completely implementing discussions of topics about routine and economy , science and technology stipulated in the " common agreement of the Wang - Gu talks " , and has suggested many times to the Straits Foundation that discussions on the " rights of Taiwanese merchants investing in the mainland and related issues " should be started early .
Our association holds that the personal and property safety of Taiwanese merchants investing in the mainland have legal safeguards , and if the Straits Foundation felt it was needed , it could exchange views while discussing " Rights of Taiwanese merchants investing in the mainland and related issues " .
Thirdly , the Straits Association has repeatedly requested that both associations should conduct consultative discussions on issues of the Taiwanese military killing and wounding mainland coastal fishermen and causing serious life and property losses in recent years .
Since establishing the Straits Association , it has continuously pointed out such inhumane behavior to the Straits Foundation which seriously hurts feelings of compatriots of both sides and breaks the harmonious atmosphere on both sides , so as to attract the attention of relevant Taiwanese areas on compensating for losses , finding those responsible , and severely punishing the assailants .
It has appealed to stop such violence at the root through negotiation between the two associations .
However , up to now , the Straits Foundation 's response has not been received .
The communique clearly points out that in the above issues involving rights of compatriots of both sides of the Straits in contact and exchange , personal safety is included , so as for the long delay in starting discussions , the fault is not with the Straits Association .
The communique says that current methods of contact and co-operation between the two associations must strictly follow the " regulation agreement of contact and talks between the two associations " signed last year .
Since the " QianDao Lake Incident " occurred , the Straits Association has , according to the agreement , reported the situation to the Straits Foundation , explaining and answering a certain number of questions and requests brought up by the Straits Foundation .
However , the Straits Foundation has repeatedly raised demands that exceed the above agreement of the two associations .
Despite being reminded by the Straits Association , the Straits Foundation still repeatedly persists .
This is a practice that disrespects the agreement between the two associations .
It is continually hoped that the contact and co-operation of the two associations can be conducted in accordance with the current agreement .
The communique points out that as far as the " QianDao Lake Incident " is concerned , the top priority is investigating and settling the case in accordance with the law .
At the same time , to express further goodwill , the Straits Association has proactively invited the Straits Foundation and relevant experts to come to Zhejiang .
The Straits Association will arrange experts ' to be presented with the details of the incident and reply to questions .
If the Straits Foundation is willing to know the details of this case and sincerely understands the feelings of dependents of those who perished , then it is difficult to understand why it again sets up prerequisites ?
The Straits Association again reaffirms the above invitation , and hopes that the Straits Foundation would soon provide the date of its departure and the name list .
According to relevant sources , currently , the three suspected criminals have been arrested , and a trial will soon be carried out according to legal procedure .

Jiaju Hou , a Taiwan economist , published an article with the title " Three comments on ' do n't rush , be patient ' " in Taiwan 's " Daily Economy " on Monday , pointing out that Taiwan authorities ' adopting a " do n't rush , be patient " restriction policy for Taiwan businessmen investing in our country 's mainland would give rise to many abuses .
Jiaju Hou points out that Taiwan authorities say that " do n't rush , be patient " is to restrict large - sized Taiwan companies from going to China 's mainland to invest and would have no impact on medium - and small - sized companies , but this is actually not the case .
Currently , Taiwan authorities define medium - and small - sized companies as having capital of under 60 million Taiwan dollars , but actually Taiwan 's current medium - and small - sized companies mostly have significant scale .
Taking medium and small - sized companies listed last year as top ten for example , the smallest net operating revenue of these was 3.365 billion Taiwan dollars , the highest reached 10 billion Taiwan dollars .
Obviously , implementing a " do n't rush , be patient " policy will result in losing many business opportunities in our country 's mainland for no reason .
Jiaju Hou believed that the " do n't rush , be patient " policy would also have influence on exports to our country 's mainland .
Because , among exports from Taiwan to our country 's mainland , a large portion are due to Taiwan businessmen investing in setting up factories in our country 's mainland and needing to ship spare parts for machines and equipment and intermediate raw materials .
In recent years , Taiwan 's trade surplus with our country 's mainland has accumulatively reached 80 billion US dollars , which is almost the same as Taiwan 's foreign currency reserve .
While the financial storm shows no sign of relief today , the importance of this surplus is more and more obvious .
How can Taiwan decrease exports to our country 's mainland for the sake of " do n't rush , be patient " ?
Because this will reduce its trade surplus with our country 's mainland .
Jiaju Hou pointed out that the " do n't rush , be patient " policy would also restrain foreign businessmen from investing in Taiwan .
Because most foreign businessmen investing in Taiwan want to take this opportunity to jointly invest in our country 's mainland with Taiwan investments .
Therefore , this policy , while blocking the development of local enterprises , will also limit foreign businessmen 's wishes to invest in Taiwan .
It is reported that Jiaju Hou has successively published 3 articles in Taiwan newspapers on the " do n't rush , be patient " policy , pointing out to Taiwan authorities that this erroneous mainland economic and trade policy violates the " basic philosophy of free economy " , and hopes that Taiwan authorities " are warned of the consequences " .

The investment of foreign capital in agriculture in Jiangsu province is increasing daily .
To date , the number of projects with direct foreign investment in agriculture in Jiangsu province has reached 800 , with a sum of money of more than 800 million US dollars .
An official from the Jiangsu Agriculture and Forestry Department said that , since 1994 the number of " three - capital " enterprises that have been approved by the agricultural system of Jiangsu province has exceeded 500 , and the amount of foreign capital being put to use was more than 700 million US dollars , which represented threefold and sevenfold increases , respectively , over the years before 1993 .
The foreign investment increase from the US , Japan and Singapore was comparatively larger .
The proportion of foreign investment in the new projects is growing larger and larger and the number of exclusively foreign - owned enterprises has markedly increased .
The rapid increase in foreign investment has , to a certain extent , made up for investment shortfalls in agriculture in Jiangsu province and has expedited the development and utilization of agricultural resources .
According to statistics , currently in Jiangsu province the enterprises for processing agricultural and allied products that have output values exceeding 100 million yuan RMB already number more than 100 .
Using a loan from the Japanese government and the direct investment of foreign companies , the Lianyugang Ruyi Group has built a vegetable processing and marketing enterprise that is the largest in export volume and has the greatest variety in China at present .
Using foreign investment , Jiangsu has also introduced nearly 100 varieties of fine produce such as beer barley , California perch , Luoshi pond shrimp , fine poultry , lean meat pigs and vegetables , and flowers and plants , along with advanced production and processing technology , and it has substantially raised agricultural production levels .

" Five years ago , when China 's digital telephone program - controlled switch market was monopolized by various brands of foreign products , we worried about whether China could successfully develop digital program - controlled switches .
Today , domestically produced high - performance telephone program - controlled telephone switches already account for 36 % of the domestic market share . "
" When China 's National Meteorological Bureau bought mainframe computers from Cray Inc. of the U.S. , it just sold us two processors .
Today , the maximum computing speed of the ' Dawn 1000 ' computer we developed ourselves has already reached 2.5 billion operations per second , exceeding the speed of the computer sold to us by Cray Inc. "
This is part of the speech delivered at the working meeting of the " 863 Program " today by Jian Song , State council member and concurrently director of the National Science Commission .
The " 863 Program " is China 's high - tech research program , initiated in 1986 .
Western developed countries have always restricted the export of important high - tech products , such as high - performance large - scale digital telephone program - controlled switches and supercomputers , to China .
Jian Song said that " Today , China is capable of producing more than 10,000 sets of digital telephone program - controlled switches , and the chief designer of this kind of switch is only 28 years old , graduating from Wuhan University . "
Most of the research staff who successfully developed the ' Dawning 1000 ' computer last year are young people about 30 years old .
Today , Jian Song said to hundreds of high - tech experts representatives and science and technology officials attending the meeting : " The series of achievements we have made in the development and industrialization of high - tech help us to further overcome timid thoughts that high - tech is unattainable .
They have greatly enhanced our whole nation 's courage and confidence in realizing socialist modernization . "
The " 863 Program " , with a total investment of 10 billion yuan RMB and a duration of 15 years , since its implementation in 1986 , has gained breakthroughs in a large number of significant key fields of technology .
It has greatly narrowed the gap between China 's high - tech and the internationally advanced levels , and has promoted the modernization of civilian industry and the national defense industry .
In the civilian fields of biotechnology , information technology , automation technology , energy technology and new materials technology alone , more than 1200 research achievements have been made , of which 560 have reached internationally advanced levels .
This aside , China has scheduled more than 400 research projects in the fields of aerospace technology and laser technology , involving space science and application , jumbo carrier rockets , space stations , space shuttle transportation systems , and has made phased achievements in certain key technology fields .
Jian Song also cited the significant achievements that the internationally advanced level gained in fields such as agricultural biotechnology , biomedicine , genetic engineering , lasers , robotics , etc .
For example , a Chinese developed genetically engineered Hepatitis B vaccine and an " a " interferon for blocking the progress of Hepatitis B have entered the market , which is good news for the 120 million Hepatitis B virus carriers in China .
Later stages of Hepatitis B often develop into liver cancer .
China has determined its focus of high - tech research for the coming five years , and set about drawing up the next century 's high - tech research plans .
Finally , Jian Song said , " Whether our own high - tech and its industry can be successful is related to the success or failure of China 's undertaking of modernization , and is related to the rise and fall of the Chinese people .
To vigorously develop high - tech and establish a powerful national high - tech industry in our country as soon as possible is an urgent task currently facing China 's scientific and technological circles and economic circles . "

According to what has been reported in the Soviet " Science and Life " magazine , biologists in Moscow have discovered that a mold element in the cells of plants can not only control the propagation of plasmodium in mosquitoes , but can also kill mosquitoes .
This method will not pollute the environment .
Biologists mixed a mold element in the cells of plants with pearl powder to produce a granulated drug .
This kind of drug can slowly discharge the mold element from the cells of plants in water .
When mosquitoes feed , they suck the mold element from the cells of plants into their bodies .
Experiments have shown that adopting this method can reduce the chances of mosquitoes transmitting malaria down to 1/70th to 1/80th of the original ratio .

Among the people who kept a close watch of the gathering through the Internet , many were college students .
At the gathering site , besides local New York students , many more were students who came from upstate New York , Washington , Pennsylvania , Connecticut , Massachusetts , and New Jersey .
They started out early in the morning and drove several hours to hurry to New York .
They all said that despite the long journey and the fact that they were facing tense year - end examinations , this was the first large - scale gathering of Chinese in the eastern U. S. region to support the Olympic Games , so they definitely had to take part .
Even though the promoters of the gathering were youngsters , old overseas Chinese also actively responded .
Old Mr. Huang who emigrated to the United States in 1966 stated that despite being in the United States , he would support everything that related to China .
Mr. and Mrs. Luo who had been in the United States for over 20 years said that many of their friends had worked in Tibet .
They believed that the central government treated Tibet very nicely .
A Mr. Xu who had worked at the municipal government for over 30 years said excitedly that once anything related to China happened , both CNN and ABC would seize the opportunity to kick up a rumpus .
They were obviously making trouble .
It was irritating .

The telecommunications sector is the largest market for IC card application in our country with the largest number of cards issued among all sectors .
The total number of cards issued has exceeded 2 billion .
At the 9th national IC card application work conference of the State Golden Card Project , Zhang Qi , member of the Project 's coordination leadership group as well as office director , said that since the first set of IC calling cards was issued in 1995 , the total number of cards issued in the telecommunications sector has exceeded 2 billion .
Among these , China Telecom issued a total of about 900 million cards , adding more than 25 million new cards this year alone .
This year , China Mobile issued about 400 million cards , while China Unicom issued about 200 million cards .
According to the briefing , the capacity of mobile phone cards in our country has developed from the initial 3K to the current 128K for commercial use .
The functions have also evolved from the single voice function , simple ID verification , telephone directory , and text messaging to the current diverse operations supporting various kinds of value - added mobile services .
Zhang Qi said that by the end of October 2006 , there are 450 million mobile phone users in our country with a penetration rate of 34 % .

Currently , in areas like Tianjin , Hebei , Shanxi , Gansu , and Xinjiang , employers no longer directly pay the heating bills ; instead , work units would distribute special subsidies to their employees , who would then pay their own heating expenses ; hence , the reform of heating bill payment has changed from an " implicit subsidy " to an " explicit subsidy " system .
For years , those who have enjoyed the " implicit subsidy " benefits are those who are within the system , for instance , employees of party and government organizations , institutions , and state - owned enterprises with good returns .
But for the large number of people who work outside the system , who has ever enjoyed the " implicit subsidy " benefits for their heating bills ?
In fact , independently operated state - owned enterprises and institutions that are financially responsible for their own profits and losses have already had an " explicit " subsidy system as long as they are financially strong .
The reform from " implicit subsidy " to " explicit subsidy " only affects party and government organizations with financial allocation .
Such a subsidy does not expand the coverage , it only offers subsidies to the original groups of people who were entitled to such benefits .
If employees of party and government organizations as well as state - owned enterprises and institutions pay the same rate for water and electricity as those who work in the private sector or who are self - employed , why ca n't they pay the same rate for heat
Not all gamers will become professional players .
Lee Yun - Lit believes that the space perceptual ability , operating and response speeds on the computer keyboard , and the ability to quickly process information in a short time are all important for professional players in games .
The average age of South Korean professional gamers is 20.4 , but those entering the profession are getting increasingly younger .
In general , the players have to retire after 25 years old .
But presently the future outlook for retired players is also quite good .
Some of them can enter the air force gaming team as special talents .
Furthemore , some famous players can also remain in their teams as instructors or become TV commentators for games .
Still some others can receive further professional game training in universities and later be employed as technical consultants by large game manufacturers , etc .
In short , top talented gamers are a scarce resource in South Korea .
