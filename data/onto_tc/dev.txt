so he said to let your wife do it you know
%uh right
he says %uh you know no I 'm going to
%eh so now I 'm at a point that it 's very strange
like I wo n't complain about anything
or I ca n't complain about anything
and I ca n't ask him to come help me in the middle of the night when I forgot to take out something they put in the freezer
So we 'll see how it goes
hopefully
I mean they promise me you know everybody that they 're going to help me and that whatever I say
But you know everybody gives you %uh these %uh pro-
yeah
so you 've already started
Well I 've started working with Du
like I do n't cook anymore
I have n't worked in the kitchen for a week already
I 've been just doing with him learning how to do the orders and meeting all the %um sales people
and %um I 've learned how to work the computer which is the bigges-
I said I do n't know how to turn it on even
really
So I 'm not
I do n't know if I could do it yet by myself
but he 's showing me teaching me
and I think like the middle of this week he 'll be there a few days with me
and then anoth-
he %um
Maybe here and there
but he 's really basically
What is he going to do
He 's going to be a teacher for %um High school computers
oh okay
yeah
so he 's only teaching three days a week
so he always says that on the other days if I need him he 'll come in
the truth is he 's been teaching and very patient and very good
and he also is great that he has written down everything
I 'm sure he 's thrilled to get out of there
Well I 'll tell you the truth %uh
I mean now that I worked with him one to one He does do everything with his heart
I mean he has a different head than everybody else
like I know that he wants everything to be nice and to be good and
but he 's very separate
and he does n't like to listen to other people 's %um ideas
but %um I 'm sure financially he was probably great for the kibbutz because he was cheap
yeah
because he 's also
I 'll tell you
I worked with him this whole week
he does n't eat a thing ever
like all morning long
so he does n't eat
he does n't drink coffee
I did n't see him drink anything water or anything else
one day he said I better drink something I have a headache because it was really hot
but I mean you know he does n't eat anything
and then for lunch when we finally went to go get something to eat Also he eats like a little What we would eat maybe half for a meal
and that 's it
so I can understand now why he thinks that because he does n't have big eyes you know
right
that 's so funny
but anyway
no
so he had agreed to do it for a year
and his year is over
I
are you excited at all about it
or
well I 'll tell you the truth
until I made the decision I was scared and also utz
I miss the cooking part
You miss it
that 's funny
I
yeah
yeah
like this week even when they made the %um coleslaw you know & kept calling me to taste it and make sure that it was the way that I do it
and so Matty said to me Ellen you did n't make the coleslaw
I said it 's over you know
I ca n't do everything
tha-
and they 're going to notice that the cooking is different
Well that 's what even **ruthie** says you know
everyone thinks that the economie is so important
but there 's a lot of things that are very important of running the kitchen
and we 'll see
%uh right now Ramon %uh
you know Cocoa she got married
She married that guy
not the Israeli guy not the Sephardic guy but No you 're kidding that little feminine kind of guy
No
but reme-
when I was there in October she had that guy from Yerushalaim that guy
yeah
820.26_822.65_B: no
but %um it was over already around then
but they were still friends
and this guy was a here or something drawer
I think his family is Romanian or something
anyway
yeah
it was very fast
and they got married
How old is she ?
She 's eighteen and a half
she 'll be nineteen in December
oh my god
why did they allow that
Well I guess they did n't have a choice
but the worst thing was originally when she came to her parents and she was going to get married she was going to get married in October
but she got engaged like before Pesach
so going to get married in October
so they were n't so thrilled
but at least okay it 's %uh
and then all of a sudden they came back and said no we want to get married
they got married the I think oh my g- second week in June
on kibbutz
yeah
it was beautiful
we do weddings %eh so much nicer than in the old days
first of all we rent tables and chairs
yeah
so it 's like
and we did it on the grass outside the
and it was beautiful
we read
that
so she 's like the first child who got married
right
and we rented beautiful china and silverware and glasses
wow
beautiful
I must admit it was really really beautiful
and then serving everything we use like %um all different kinds of bought kind of %um paper plates that
uh-huh
probably like the hard plastic
and it was amazing because they even had like a bar set up
and they had oh my go- fruit
they had hay
and then they had fruit
it was gorgeous
it was absolutely gorgeous
Does she now have to do tzavah or no
no no
but %ah marriage is
you do n't have to do the tzavah
oh my go-
So she 's working now in the vegetarian kitchen and the a little bit
but she 's going to study in September
so that 's not so long
Does she cover her hair
No
oh I keep
that other guy was real
this one is
I can not bel-
oh this other one 's like from a family that 's not at all
but he
yeah
they went to America for a month after the wedding
her grandparents sent them %uh oh my Even though they were mad
you know the typical Ariella story
they came for Pesach
and then they told them
they waited to tell them that they got engaged
and the wedding is in June
and they were so angry because how the hell could they come back after years
that 's true
No
so on one hand I understand them
it 's not fair
No of course not
965.04_967.89_B: even they could have called them before Pesach
maybe they would 've changed their minds
but
wait
yeah
Natan 's sister was here also
So they were all upset that the grandparents did n't come back for the wedding
but I do n't know
you have to look at you know both
oh my
I ca n't believe she got married
I
she got married
and then the week after Ta'al Paer got married
you know Ta'al is the oldest %uh girl on the
I
yeah
where is she living
Well her husband he looks like Mickey our Mickey yeah when Mickey was really young
so he looks really young
%uh she just finished now the army
and she met him during the army
he 's from a nonreligious kibbutz
oh my gosh
yeah
So now they 're living on his kibbutz %um because they allow like B'nai to live there
but I do n't know they can work outside yeah do whatever they want until they decide what they want or do what they want
do whatever they want
study
I do n't know what they 're doing
his parents are n't even living on the kibbutz anymore because he 's a professor of something or other in I do n't know China or somewhere
Singapore
I do n't know where
anyway so that was really weird
like when she got engaged it was a little hard for Rachel because he 's not religious and everyone was really upset
gosh you would think at least in Israel you would get what you want
No
but not only that
what
this kid just left the kibbutz at eighteen
and now at nineteen he 's coming back with &uh you know like
He also had a lot of different boyfriends during her lifetime
anyway to make a long story short she had her wedding also
but hers we did like %um a buffet
so I was really nervous about that because when did we ever do a buffet
so we rented the tables and chairs again
and we rented all the beautiful dishes
yeah
But we set up the buffet
we bought like these really neat
you know like they 're
Well we saved them because you can wash them
they 're made out of plastic
but they look like silver trays
uh-huh
yeah
So we bought all different shapes and sizes
and we put out the salads and the meats and all different kinds that
we had %um little cocktail hot dogs
and we had chicken legs
and we had schnitzels
oh and they made a beautiful basket with breads you know everything falling out on the table
you know those kind of things
no
wow
No
it was beautiful
it also came out really nice
the only thing
you guys must feel so old that you have married children already
yeah
we do feel old
and it was beautiful
Ramona 's was nicer because they had a great band and everybody was that
you know like usually in a wedding there 's no room to dance
but the whole parking lot was for dancing
and on the grass was where we sat
wow
uh-huh
so it was like as if you would 've seen you know dance festival because there was like a circle of men a circle of girls a circle of her friends a circle of his friends because there was enough room the kids had a circle that you could have like five six different circles all over the place
oh my gosh
it was beautiful
and Ta'al 's
what happened
you know that Rachel was really worried that people wo n't dance for her be happy for her
I do n't know why
that was ridiculous because everyone was just as happy
but her band they got stuck somewhere
and their %um
something with the electric equipment
it did n't come
so we had to get from us the amplifiers
and ours are terrible
%mm oy
they could n't hear anything
so So some people got really you know
just they did n't dance
and she was really upset
I said Rachel why did you even bother paying them
Well that 's true
getting this really great group
and even if we would 've known they were stuck so call the kibbutz
we would 've sent the car to go get it
right
oh gosh
so that was bad news
but other than that
so anybody else engaged
not yet
the rest are young
well that whole class that whole first
no
but there was only those two girls Ta'al from the first class
Ramona from the second
now these other kids just finished high school
like & 's oldest daughter is going to the army next week or two weeks
wow
but does n't she have a son who 's older
yeah
her son is still in the army
uh-huh
no
but he 's not engaged yet
I think boys wait a little longer
mhm
yeah maybe
Is Liat still going with that guy ?
yeah
until like you find something that is n't stressful and not boring .
yeah
that 's the main two combinations right ?
yeah .
Not stressful and not boring
yeah .
Well it 's like I have no problems with secretarial work
okay that 's what fitted in to that category because if you are a busy enough secretary you know %eh %mm . you do n't get bored because you are always doing something different
and if your employer is a relatively decent human being you know two if's there
mhm .
but you get no respect
I mean oh you 're a secretary
and the pay is pretty crummy
well it 's pretty much the same as what I 'm getting you know %um depending upon where you work and all
but you know it 's like that 's no answer either
so I 've just been toying with this idea of going back to school and getting a computer science degree so I can always be gainfully employed .
But anyway ,
and you can think about that pregnancy thing
oh yeah
that pregnancy thing
yeah
that
do the
Maybe there 's your hormones calling .
yeah
well no
the funny thing is it 's like ten years ago I would 've said oh yeah that was what I really wanted to be doing is having a baby you know
but like at this point in time it 's kind of like we 're going to do it because if we do n't do it %uh %eh you know in the next year or two we 'd regret it you know
we figure it 's something we 'd want to do
it 's not like we 're doing it because we have to do it or there 's peer pressure
or well a %mm little peer pressure
oh no no no
I know exactly where you 're at because I think about that too
I got about like six or seven years
I figure my body is a very slow %um yeah **maturer**
you know what I mean
like I did n't get my period until I was sixteen
I mean I look like about %uh %uh at least five or six years younger than I actually am
-- and I 'm just starting to get my period actually now -- yeah yeah as an adult .
So I kind of figure well I 'm probably good until at least some time in the early forties
and I could probably go a little longer than that
I know there 's a risk and all that bullshit
yeah .
but %um yeah I think about that too because it 's like I mean I kind of like the way things are going in the total lack of responsibility .
I know
well I mean that 's the thing
kids are cute and all that
and we %mm slept until noon
we got up about ten and was like oh we have to get out of bed played with the cats fell back to sleep
okay I mean we 're talking total slackers
%mm
and I thought gee you know if we had a kid we could n't do this you know
and
%mm
No
you got to be focused on that
and I mean there 's a lots of other things that
I mean as far as like living situation I was feeling kind of settled you know like -- Right . I 'm not going to be like traipsing around
but I mean I could say that for the next five or even eight or maybe -- yeah . -- ten years alright
even if I could project that far which I really ca n't
yeah
but I mean you got a kid you ca n't do fucking ten years w- --
I know .
-- it 's like cool I think I 'll go off to the Orient and start like bouncing from country country .
I know
well and I mean okay Emory wants to get his doctorate
so we 'll know next Spring if he can get at least accepted into the program which hopefully -- %mm . -- you know
and then there 's four or five years doing the damn work
and %mm . He 's crazy
he wants it
that 's fine
he can do it
no problem
but %um that sort of ties us up here although we like the place
we 're in no hurry to leave it
yeah .
and that would be good
But then you know what if he could get a position overseas again which is something both of us have said would be pretty darn good because -- %mm . -- %um you know after coming back from Spain from those two and half years it was n't so much an adjustment to the way things were
it 's just asking the question gee do we really like %um the way things are over here with the lifestyle the nine to five kind of thing
I mean I 'm really in the nine to five thing more so than he is
you know he should be there by oh oh well let 's say eight thirty to nine
but yeah
he does n't care when
well okay
%um and his professor is obviously %uh %uh a great person to work for
so I 'm envious
but %um whatever
you know I 'm caught up %mm . -- in it
and I do n't like it you know
too many days I 'm working and eating at my desk at about twelve o'clock
and I 'm thinking %mm . This is crazy you know
in Spain %uh we had this break
and you sat
you talked to people you know
you enjoyed your food
you relaxed -- %mm . -- you know
and it 's a fairly productive nation right you know
What 's going on here ?
yeah
I mean they both have the advantages and disadvantages
what you have to do is concentrate on the advantages in what ever place you 're in -- mhm -- and think about the disadvantages of the place that you 're not in .
yeah
Otherwise you go nuts right ?
That 's true ,
yeah .
yeah .
I know Laura tried to
%uh because we have email and so she sent me a letter back saying you know remember how crowded the transportation is and %uh what else -- %mm . how expensive everything is
and %uh you know I remember those things of course you know --
And work you know possibilities were a lot more limited
True .
and the language you know yeah . constantly like kind of
like I mean those could be considered positive things as well
yeah
but I mean you mind as well think of them in a negative vie- rather than
mhm sure
They just like worrying over them .
Well you know and that 's why it helps to have kind of a glimpse into the future right ?
And that 's how we got to -- %mm . -- Spain in the first place is we said we wanted to live abroad and we would try to do it you know as teachers
and it turned out that way because -- %mm . -- we had this idea of
and I really feel that that 's important
and so what I 'm having an idea of now is
okay you know Emory works on his doctorate
it takes about five or six years
we have the kid probably
he gets a research position somewhere in France or in Spain %um
and then we move over there
and you know I take care of the kid and do some you know little day labor whatever you know
we 'll see
%mm .
%um and we have relatively mellow life for who knows five or ten years
and then we take it from there .
yeah
because even like you know I mean all that stuff right is all so subject to whatever change in the weather that happens to be right ?
mhm .
oh I know
I know
and it 's like you know what I think because I get the same as you
like some days it 's just kind of like you know what the hell am I doing not with my life but ge-
but I mean just like where do I get the animal just you know to do anything you know
I just lay in bed and dream for the whole day easily
yeah
I know .
Well I know
I know what you 're saying
I feel there 's sort of a line to cross too between really planning it out and worry and stressing over it because for a while a couple months back there I was thinking in terms of oh gosh you know can we ever afford a house
%mm .
and then we sat down and sort of looked at it financially and said is this what we really want to be worrying about right now
and you know I realize no
yeah absolutely .
and so you know you can sort of focus too much on the future
or I know I have this tendency to do that .
And miss the present completely
I mean miss like you know the smell of the goddamn onions frying in the pan yeah . yeah yeah . you know and each little
I mean it 's like as far as I 'm concerned there 's like no pleasure that 's as intense as the one that you are experiencing at that moment you know
you can think about what something might be like or reminisce about the past
but like when you 're there in that moment it 's
I mean everything else just kind of like
it 's almost like time does n't exist . yeah . You know
yeah
Well I know one of the best moments I can recall in these past two months is
okay I get to work a little bit late which is common
and they do n't really care since I 'm an hourly you know
you have to be within a certain time frame
%mm .
and so everyone else is parked .
I 'm way out there in the parking lot closer to where the trees are
and you know I close the door
I just take a deep breath as I go okay another day
and I hear the birds singing --
yeah .
and I just stop for a minute and listen to the birds
and it sort of cheers me up
you know I realize what a minute okay
in that nasty sterile office where the windows do n't even open --
%eh %um I will be for the next eight hours or so
but out here there still is some life going on
and just sort of cheers me up to know that
okay
I can come back to it you know
So that 's
yeah
in that moment I mean nobody is going to like interfere with that at all .
There you are you and the birds you know
yeah
yeah
yup
hey we can find good Spanish wine over here speaking of the moment you know
oh yeah
And every once in a while you know I can remember just being back %um with people or eating some place you know in Barcelona
and %uh so it brings me back
but
I still have n't gone to that fresh French restaurant by your house
%um
I 'm like dying to go there
You mean the one right next to the apartment
yeah yeah yeah
Well it 's not French
it 's just gourmet
it 's gourmet catalon --
oh it 's not
oh I thought it was Fre-
%ah really
yeah yeah
Well even better .
save it for a special occasion you know
and you know you might need a reservation too
yeah %um
yeah
I will
I should have some visitors
and my family 's planning on coming this summer
so I 'll take them there and this fondue place I wanted to take them to also .
yeah yeah
Is the one over in Gracia that
it 's kind of on a corner I think
I think I
%uh
no
there 's a couple places in Gracia that I 've been going to
uh-huh .
But %uh there 's one in the %um Bario Gottigo
actually it 's on the other side of Leotana %huh . Like down over by the Bornillo
okay .
And I 've only eaten there once alright
but I 've been in a million times because every time I pass with somebody I have to show them the place .
uh-huh .
Actually you know I know where I 'm going to go
I have a friend my friend from England
I do n't remember if I told you about her
she 's my old %um roommate mhm . From Oviato
and she 's coming
she got a job down here
she 's coming on Friday to live
mhm
And %ah I
this is like the perfect
because when we lived in Oviato we used to go to this fondue place all the time
that would be the perfect place to take her when she gets her .
yeah
yeah
well I 'm glad to hear that you got a job that you like and %uh %um think that you were able to stay
I was a little bit worried at first you know when you got back there because the money would run out probably in April or so
and you know
yeah
And I mean I knew I would get a job
and after I just stopped thinking about it I just thought well fuck it
I am going
it 's like inevitable
and I want something
I have to get something
and I will
uh-huh
%um %huh
But I just thought that you know I 'll get a job
and at this point if I get desperate I 'll just have to take anything
yeah .
And the fact that I like kind of fell into something that 's Fairly sweet
I mean %eh in the beginning everything kind of starts out nice
but I 'm changing my attitude to the point where I 'm not going to get stressed out about it too much .
I 'm not going to try to change anything
Good
I 'm going to go in there
I 'm going to do a nice job
I 'm going to have a good time uh-huh . you know
and I 'm not going to
I mean it 's not the same
I 'm either
like from working with kids
I mean that was like you know my career for like eight years
mhm .
But this is you know more like
it 's nice
it 's really nice
Well and you can always go back to that if you wanted to you know working at least in the States
or maybe eventually once you have your residency yeah you can work in some place in Spain too with l- %ah
yeah
yeah ,
I do n't have a big draw for it right now
if anything like I 've always wanted to have like a bar or a restaurant
I mean it takes tons of money
yeah
yeah
me too
well
well
But like I 'd love to
That 's why I want to win the lottery first though Or to have enough background money to set that kind of thing up
but %um well
yeah
well %um good
and so you 're probably not going to come back Christmas which is cool
Emory was telling me that
so
yeah
and I probably wo n't
Theoretically I 'll be here .
theoretically ?
yeah .
You mean , do n't you well , you carry multiple calendars , so you never know ?
Well I do have two .
One in the office and one at home .
oh
The weekend after that %uh I will not be in town .
But , %um yeah ,
as I say , theoretically I 'm here .
yeah .
I have n't decided whether I 'm doing this yet .
It is a bit silly , you know ?
I was just there .
But I 've been , %um ,
the next weekend again I 'm invited for the
let 's see
the child of my favorite cousin is being baptized ,
and they want me to be the godmother
%mm .
English .
Patentante , ja .
Yes ,
And , so , since I did n't go to their wedding , I -- feeling this big pressure .
I should have just gone to the wedding last year .
It was , like oh yeah . in
They started asking me when I was on vacation already .
And so I 'm sort of
it 's easier to think about doing it when you 're on vacation yeah . than if you get this idea %eh when you 're at work and say , oh I ca n't go in four weeks .
How could I possibly just do that ?
yeah I know the feeling .
I m-
But once you 're in vacation mode , it 's sort of like well why should n't I ?
I have the vacation ,
it 's just you know , the time , and the money ,
and what is money for
yeah .
Right .
So I have to make up
It 's a debate .
You sound like you 're the bank .
No .
But I have to make up my mind here by Friday because that 's when I can hold my ticket too .
So I thought I could get a ticket .
I just have to have a discussion with my boss .
So you have to let me know what this entails as consequences for me ?
oh for ,
oh yes .
oh there are good consequences , if you 're willing .
I mean , aside from
so I have to be there on the twentieth in Berlin ,
okay .
uh-huh .
And I could n't go for you know , just , For the day . you know three days .
So I had to go at least a week .
yeah .
And there was an advantage .
It 's because ,
and if you 'd like to join me I 'd love it ,
I was also invited to a wedding on the twelfth somewhere near Duesseldorf .
Between Duesseldorf and Essen .
Well that can only be Rathingen or
No it 's north of Rathingen ,
because I 've seen a map .
But it 's in a small thing .
oh Ketting ?
k-
Ketwig .
Ketwig , Ketwig .
Yes .
yeah ,
that 's almost Duesseldorf .
%uh , that 's almost Essen .
okay .
Whichever .
I suppose that 's close .
yeah ,
it 's not far .
Through the S - bahn here .
I mean it 's like twenty minutes .
Or something .
And so , if I do it , I 'd love to have you join me .
It 's a fancy wedding too .
Does that mean I have to get
Do I have to wear a tie ?
Yes .
Sure .
y-
%um
could be it 's actually
I ca n't believe this .
This is a German friend that I
he worked here at NASA for like two years and was in mhm our German conversation club .
yeah .
And he 's marrying a German woman .
I mean he just went back a little while ago because his
No he 's an American ,
but he 's marrying a German woman .
oh , he 's a German .
He 's German too .
yeah .
They 're both German .
So this is a real mhm . German wedding .
But
And so he was saying we should come from our
and one other person from our group is going because we would
he had n't gotten around to planning his vacation .
So he 's going to be there .
So I thought well that 's on the twelfth , and the other thing is on the twentieth , you know .
Why not ?
And then in between I 'm going to go down and 586.14_588.20_A: see my relatives in Bonn .
oh well the twentieth i- ,
I mean that could be a pro- , e-
Well no not the twentieth .
The twentieth is my baptism .
%ah so .
The wedding is the twelfth .
The wedding is the twelfth ?
But it 's like a real thing .
There 's like a wedding at eleven , and a lunch at Schloss Ketwig or something at lunchtime .
And then at seven o'clock there is , let 's see , %uh dinner dance . mit Abendgarderobe .
oh God . nay
But I thought you playing piano you must have that .
Abendgarderobe .
Does n't that mean like really fancy clothes ?
%uh , well .
Ja , ja .
Ball dresses and , you know , tuxedos and things .
yeah , I know .
I could n't believe it
because I met ,
when I was there on the other trip , I had n't read the invitation before .
I did n't think I was going .
And so I had met , %uh , his name is Heiko , for one day in Hamburg .
We met .
yeah .
So he mentioned that he was looking for his tuxedo .
And I said you 're going to get married in a tuxedo ?
He said no , no , no .
That evening .
I 've never heard of such a thing .
Quite a wedding .
But so if you want to bow out .
Pardon ?
I said if you really do n't like those things .
Well .
But you know . It 's great meals .
Really .
Free food .
Aside from , we can talk ,
and they should be nice people .
It 'll be
and then I 'll know one more person there .
How old are they ?
oh .
A little bit younger than us .
oh , he 's probably
good question .
I do n't know .
Maybe he 's thirty - two ?
That 's okay .
As long as they 're not twenty - one .
oh no , no , no , no .
No %uh , spring chicken
This is Herr Doktor Heiko Hecht and Jessika whatever her name is .
ooh .
They actually met in the United States . At I think the University &of Virginia , where he got his doctorate ?
Or , maybe it 's not Virginia ,
but it 's somewhere over there .
mhm .
Something I do n't know .
mhm %hm .
yeah ,
so , you know , they 're not really young .
So I s- ,
their friends I presume are in the same age .
I think there 'll be a lot of family friends .
I have a f-
okay .
yeah ,
I 'm sure .
weddings are always family .
and the way he was talking , it sounds like his wife 's family is well - to - do or something .
so
yeah
well if it , ye-
Interesting people .
If they 're having a wedding with Abendgarderobe then it 's going to be pretty
that 's what I thought .
yeah .
That 's what I thought .
Up upscale .
And that .
So think about it .
yeah . I 'll let you think about that ,
and you can write me a note or give me a call .
Because I know some people really hate weddings .
But you 're afraid to say no ,
or you have to think about it .
But it 's the twelfth .
And otherwise , what I 'd like to try to do is stay with you the twelfth and thirteenth . Because it 's weekend .
mhm .
Like we could see each other .
And then I 'll go Monday -- down to Bonn , or wherever those relatives are because I have n't seen my uncle in like three or four years , and he 's just turning eighty and I like them a lot
uh-huh .
In Bad Muenstereifel ?
yeah ,
I 'll
guess it 'll be summer
so he 'll be in Bad Munstereifel .
mhm
They 've actually moved .
They do n't live in Bonn now .
They live in -- %um , Bad Neuena . Which is I guess
Bad Neuena ja .
yeah ,
just a little bit down .
But I think they 'll be in Munstereifel .
And then my cousin , she still does live in Bonn
so I 'll get to see her .
And then I 'll zip off to Berlin Right . mhm mhm go to this wedding and see my favorite cousin .
Do n't tell the other cousins .
uh-huh .
yeah .
Because you see , when I was there before I could n't visit you because I did n't want to spend time visiting these other relatives in Bonn .
you 're so diplomatic about all of that , you know
Well I mean if I was visiting you , it would be very hard not to visit them .
but n-
But the year before I .
I would n't , %uh , tell on you , you know .
I know you would n't tell .
But the year before I did it .
But that 's because of we just stopped on the train and I had , you know , two hours .
And we had our wild lunch .
yeah .
And on again .
yeah .
That 's
We , %uh , commiserated .
Yes .
That sounds like you have you know its positive end result , which is good .
I do n't know .
I mean , it 's a change ,
that 's for sure .
It 's a change .
And it is a lot of work , obviously .
yeah ,
I ,
%eh but you know I really do n't know if it 's a lot of work .
I always have this feeling I 'm just so terribly slow .
I have this feeling I should always be doing these things much faster than I get them done .
Well , so what if you 're slow ?
You know , look at it the other way .
yeah
but I always keep %eh that I 'm spending too much time , that I should be doing other things .
yeah .
I just had this talk about somebody who was you know , confirming , you know
and I know I 'm too self critical .
So . It 's not a good idea .
Because I was complaining to them about my mother
and they are this theory that , you know , what people do is a reflection of you .
%huh .
Because this woman had such a that people react to you as a reflection of you .
And what I had mentioned about my mother bugging me was the fact that every time I see her or we even talk , she has to comment about my clothes , or what I 'm wearing .
and I was talking to this woman because she seemed to have such a good relationship with her mother .
Like her mother treated her like a human being and not a kid .
%hm yeah
and so she said you know and she 's just a reflection .
You know your mother 's being critical you know .
Be you see that because you 're critical to yourself too much
Or you 're filtering the information you get from your mother
yeah
but this is ridiculous .
I mean %uh she 's never let up on that .
I mean it 's crazy . You know .
I do n't I mean
and I think no not the last time the last time on the phone I bugged her about something else that I been trying to not take anymore
but then she cries
but that does n't work with me .
uh-huh .
That 's good .
Then she says I 'm being mean .
and I ignore the fact that she 's crying .
I 'm pretty tough .
yeah
yeah
speaking of crying , I have a colleague . An American girl , a dancer . mhm at a school in Cologne mhm Who somehow or other has fallen in love with me .
mhm
and now that I 'm , going back to Duesseldorf she 's all going crazy . %um and thinks %eh
she 's %eh concluded that I 'm abandoning her .
oho
But it is
Being stalked here ?
Pardon ?
In America , we would say are you being stalked ?
Unbelievable .
yeah
things are g-
%eh %eh thank God
really very very happy .
Very nice .
great
what 's with you ?
%uh , let 's see ,
well I 'm still hanging out at Westinghouse .
yeah .
I have your hat .
I wear your hat all the time .
oh goo-
I thought you know it 's a good hat man .
I sent that to you with all %uh good intents .
I hope you appreciate it .
I do .
I wear it all the time .
okay .
%uh %uh I hope I have %um a picture of myself when I %uh had reserves . you know the other month .
uh-huh .
I took a picture %uh with me
and I hope it comes out .
I 'll send it to you .
Thank you very much .
%um
If it does n't I 'll take another picture .
Let 's see %uh
Go ahead .
Well I 'm still working there you know
and %uh I 'm on a pretty good project .
Right .
a long term %uh next generation %uh fighter plane .
Really ?
So that 's %uh kind of good experience I guess .
uh-huh .
And %uh Westinghouse supposedly is making a bid to buy the %uh C B S broadcasting network .
I thought they bought them already .
Well , you know , it takes months to close a deal
so there 's -- %ah . -- lots of speculation -- Right . -- that they 'll have to sell the %uh electronics division in order to do that .
and what would happen with you ?
I guess we 'd be sold to another company and see what happens .
I do n't know .
mhm .
I 'm not too concerned about it though
but it 's a possibility .
But you have a senior position there .
Well , I suppose so .
But , you know . They do n't really think of it that way
they just look at the numbers how many people they want and how many people they have .
It 's just a business .
Right .
they just get rid of what they do n't want .
uh-huh .
But %uh that 's still going pretty well .
%huh
nothing really new with the house or anything
We 've had some interesting incidents with wasps that have %uh been invading the neighborhood .
they built a nest in my rafters of my house and busted through .
But I told you about that , I think .
I got a in the mail .
yeah .
So that
Well I wanted to ask you what 's with the school ?
The schools are extremely expensive .
I 'm going broke basically doing that .
And I do n't know how to %uh handle that .
But how come they do n't help you ?
It does n't make a difference .
you 're still going to go broke whether they help you or not .
They 're not going to let you run a profit when you 're on scholarship .
if you have two thousand dollars at the end of the year they 're not going to say oh well %uh I guess you can have that .
They 're going to make you pay everything .
Wait a minute
I 'm talking about
wait
wait fir-
I 'm talking about your schooling .
My schooling ?
I thought you meant the kids ' school .
My schooling ?
yeah .
I do n't know .
I put it on hold all the time .
took a course last semester
I have n't signed up yet for the fall
It 's a lot of stress .
It 's a lot of stress .
trying to
you know you put out a lot of money
and you have to work really hard to get it back .
Right .
there 's not necessarily any benefit to it either .
So
%hm .
sorry I was talking about the kids ' school .
Right
the kids . yeah
R J told me how much -- yeah . -- it costs .
But meanwhile -- It 's a lot of money . -- she does n't know how much you pay .
I do n't know why that is .
I think what we pay
%um %mm we have to %uh
%uh for two kids it cost about two hundred dollars apiece .
uh-huh ?
And then for %um the taxes and everything else maybe if it costs %uh a year %um maybe %uh seven hundred dollars a kid .
okay .
That 's total everything .
Pretty much .
yeah .
Pretty much .
So we 're paying about eight times that .
No about five times that .
yeah
five times that
No , actually , %ah we 're paying six times that .
I 'm paying four thousand two hundred dollars a kid . %uh Or more .
Right .
Right .
But then you could also look into the other part . the tax bracket
yeah .
here f- %uh
yeah
forty - five
forty - five , actually with all the other taxes that are going on here
the first job %uh I pay forty - five percent -- mhm . -- my salary .
It goes to taxes .
And then with all of my second job , it already comes out to fifty - five percent of that .
%mm %mm %mm .
Plus the taxes .
Unbelievable .
That 's incredible .
I remember I got the first paycheck
yeah
I pretty much knew that 's what the statistics were .
Right .
As soon as you get the paycheck and you see the before tax income and you say wow finally you 're able to get up to a decent number and then you look at the bottom
and you say what is this .
You put it into your little pocket calculator --
-- you say they 're taking fifty - five percent
says fifty - five percent .
I say what country -- -- in their right mind takes fif-
what about %eh trying to encourage the populace to go to work and to save more , to earn more .
%uh they do n't care .
But you still like it there ?
Fifty - five
But yo-
yeah ,
because you 're able
You 're still
%hm ?
It 's great .
It 's great .
We enjoy it .
The kids are happy .
Having a wonderful time .
yeah .
And %um even with all the political nonsense that goes on here you still feel that we 're %uh %uh building the place in a very small way .
And also the community .
we love it here .
Well I 'm sure you do .
It 's a great community .
yeah .
yeah .
It 's a nice place .
It 's a very nice place .
And I spoke to someone the other day %uh %uh about you .
oh yeah ?
Plenty of jobs .
Are you serious ?
Because you know what the problem is
there 's a guy who 's working with me now who 's an Israeli
and he 's active .
Do n't believe them .
What are they all liars ?
I mean , what 's the story here ?
You 're i-
Yes .
First of all , Israeli who is living in America -- yeah . -- has to justify himself .
So that 's what he 's going to do .
I suppose so
because man he 's just like one thing after the next .
you 're into software , right ?
yeah .
You know that guy Gordon %uh Go-
%uh %uh I do n't want to mention his name .
David Gordon ?
No .
oh
oh I know
the other guy who au-
Right
yeah
the
Ri-
mhm
That he said there 's absolutely no problem .
No problem .
%hm %hm .
He said any kind of job at a very very high salary . %uh with %uh the experience that %uh you have is absolutely no problem .
yeah ,
so what am I waiting for ?
Do you be b-
%huh ?
So what am I waiting for ?
Where does he live ,
in your community ?
yeah .
You still building
there 's no housing available though there ?
%uh , housing is %uh right now %uh %uh %uh rentals .
Only rentals ?
I would n't %uh ren-
%uh you could buy
but I would n't suggest it right now .
But they have rentals ?
yeah .
And what do they rent it at ?
You want to ge- %ah %ah %ah
let 's see
you can get a-
Just a ex-
For %uh a %uh nice apartment you can
house like my size is
the house I have -- mhm . -- would go for about five hundred dollars %uh five fifty a month .
Wow that 's great .
Right .
So you can work down to a small apartment yeah %um which wo- %um probably go for about %uh three %uh hundred and fifty dollars .
and where are most of these jobs located ?
%uh
Some of these Hertzolia
Hertzolia
yeah .
That 's not so bad .
Right
Tel Aviv Hertzolia
Even now they opened up a lot of new roads now they were building since you were here .
uh-huh
But %ah they were building while you were here .
Right .
%um and you can also
Audrey said she got to Tel Aviv the other day in like forty - five minutes
Wow . With the traffic and everything ?
with yeah the traffic
there was no traffic until she got right there to %uh yeah Tel Aviv
%mm %mm %mm
So yeah
it 's a
But you 're talking about jobs in good places , good solid companies developing companies who %um
the thing just for the fun of it then %uh
You know how I feel that
yeah
little Liz has her own reasons for you know being in America .
You should feel comfortable staying there ,
just for the fun %uh %ah send me %uh %ah a resume
okay . I 'll do that .
And I 'll just pass it on just to get an idea of how much you may be able to make .
That sounds okay
yeah .
I think that 's a excellent idea .
%um , I know your wife does n't believe me
but %uh we think about you guys like continuously .
and it really %uh makes my heart ache .
But %uh
%eh %eh if there 's anything that you think we should be %um working for let us know
oh I do n't know
I do n't know
it 's too difficult
%uh the thing with the Golan to give it back not to give it back I do n't know
everybody has a different opinion
we 've got cousins living there
beautiful beautiful home
and
yeah
yeah
yeah
I do n't know
one half their mind is thinking should they pack the suitcases
and the other half is should we add on another room for the new baby you know
%eh it 's awful
yeah
it 's a crazy crazy
it is
Well what can you do
it 's a terrible thing
I spoke to your mother in May because I wanted to know if you were coming or one of the kids are coming out
No
I did n't yet
I had a summer job
I worked
yeah
well I just finished work yesterday
it was a nine week course
it started in July and ended yesterday
she said
yeah
oh oh nice
Now I have a month 's vacation for Rosh Hashanah and everything
and after Sukkoth we start our new class
so oh very good yeah that 's a good idea My summer vacation starts now
oh that 's good
So yeah
I have about a month off
that 's good
%eh it 's not too late that I called
No no no no not at all %eh
oh good
Good
there 's something else I was in the middle
and I meant to do it weeks a-
I 'm sending a big information and letter to Simon Perez yeah because I heard him say on the radio weeks ago yeah that I mea-
I do n't know if I should really say this
you know it 's really nothing
but
oh well were being
no no
Well maybe it 's politics
maybe we should n't talk politics
%uh it 's environmental politics
it 's not %uh politics though
%um he said that Is- Israel is such a highly I knew that I do n't know I %uh advanced technical country that if there 's something good they 're going to use it
and he mentioned the hormones for the milk yeah oh yeah that was a big thing he- no there was a big thing here about the milk that they put silicon in the milk here or something there was a big thing where they were
it 's hormones to make the cows give more
oh oh oh no
that 's something different
yes
and it 's terrible
it 's a terrible horrible thing
yeah
yeah
when he says we 'll use it you know my heart went down to the floor because we 're fighting here oh I did n't hear that very much against it because it 's such a bad thing
against
yeah
yeah
I did n't hear that
It makes the cows sick
you get all the bacteria
you get the sickness
and
oh jeez I did n't know
I did n't even know that here
and now I 'm not going to drink the milk over here
No no no
I do n't know if they 're using it yet
I do n't know if they are
but it would n't be bad tha-
they 're called growth hormone
yeah
yeah
I know
I 've heard
I think they do that to the chickens
I hear they do the chickens
they want the
yeah
oh they do it here you know
it 's ap-
I 'm getting into a subject which I really did n't intend
but in Canada they wo n't do it
no no
Well a lot of people do n't eat meat anymore because of you know all these objections and all
they 've stopped %uh
it 's true
it 's true
it
Israelis do n't eat that much meat anyway
it 's more we eat fruit vegetables an- yeah yeah stuff
nobody really eats steaks anymore
like I grew up on steaks all the time from Sam 's Supermarket you know all the
yeah
from Sam 's Supermark-
uh-huh
yeah
jeez %uh the last time he had a steak was I do n't know months ago
we do n't even eat steaks anymore
but duh %eh in America too they do n't eat as much do they
%uh no
because for heart the fat is supposed by very bad
yes
Hello
oh yeah
yeah
you said people are not
no
the red meat is suffering I guess
I noticed that last time I was home
but I do n't eat any either
so
yeah
I know it 's not a good idea
I
but Canada does n't use that junk
I mean and they tell us I think Europe wo n't buy from us because they do n't want the hormones with stuff in it
yeah
yeah
I know
I know
it 's %uh
but we 're using it naturally
Well
so everything you kn-
I tell you it breaks my heart when I see them following that
they think everything is so wonderful
if there 's some
yeah
yeah
I know
they take the good and the bad all the
and that 's t-
yeah
oh it 's pitiful
that makes me very very sad
you know oh it 's %eh
very sad
and even the Russians they come over
and I know I can see the attitude %ah well that of course they know for ins-
he 's working in a neighborhood association like on funds
yeah
yeah
on grants
he does a wonderful job
and they help him
oh I think he was n't working when Holly was here
I think he was n't working
he was n't working over yeah oh that 's good that he three and half years
but this is parttime
but it 's very involving
it 's very exciting
oh that 's nice
and I thought that the people line up to see him
and it 's about getting help with housing and food stamps and everything
yeah
and a lady said you know my husband died and old lady
I said oh I 'm sorry
she says I really thought United States that you do n't die you know
and I knew that underlying it they really believe that because if it 's so wonderful
yeah
they know everyone dies
but underneath they feel maybe you do n't die until you 're very very old
but they do n't believe that so many people die in the United States because it 's so wonderful
oh wow I do n't know where they got that idea from
yeah
but you see how it is
jeez
so everybody has these wrong conceptions
I know
I know %eh
%eh %uh it 's %uh pitiful
but
oh well
yeah
I 'm su-
Holly is %uh busy with all her No that 's good now that 's nice cook things
and she 's going to teach
yeah
she had a good time sure
she 'll come back and visit and all
she had a good
oh she 's lost too
oh she misses right now %eh %eh for Rosh Hashanah
yes
she says oh on the kibbutz everybody would go out and have the meal under the stars together the first night
yeah
they have th-
yeah
that 's right
that 's right
and you know it 's just
so she misses
well you know %uh you know it 's like New Year 's %uh
everything is closed and all in America
you do n't feel the holidays because everybody 's busy doing
and here
yes
it 's not Israel although in
Well you live in a very Jewish sec-
I 'm wi-
yeah
here you do
you see him
yeah
So it 's different
but in Hudson oh we used to have to miss school
that 's right
and the teachers used to give us tests on those days just to be mean
and we used to miss the tests and everything
and
I know
Passover time we used to be embarrassed bringing matzos to school and everything
and here I mean You know they do n't know any of those feelings at all you know
I know
I know
I know
it 's th-
it 's very different
so
I know
is it something you know you remember Fred Allen and Irene ?
no I do n't
%uh they 're just names to me really
I 'm sorry
but they 're just names to me
I do n't know them
yeah
oh because you were %ah you know
yeah
they had a farm when they were first married which was like nineteen forty eight
yeah ?
and then they moved away
hello
%uh oh
yeah
I 'm here
yeah
So I think I still got five or ten minutes here as far as I know
I 'm looking at my
Are you timed
or
yeah
yeah
yeah
Well keep talking until we hang up
it 's nice talking to you
yeah
yeah
%um
So what about the Allens ?
then they moved away to Middletown
he was in the girls '
do you remember the girls ' reformatory in Hudson
yeah
yeah
%um
It was right across the street from my Aunt Seal 's house
oh she lived there ?
On Worth Avenue I th-
She did on Wor-
yeah like Bessie lived on Worth Avenue
yeah
%um
yeah
%um well it was %um my Uncle Ralph 's
it was my father 's %eh you know half brother
right
right
I remember
yeah
Mitnics the Mitnics
yes
yes
Well what about the Allens
what was their connection to that
Well so originally he had come back from the army
they got married
he graduated Cornell agricultural
had to be a farmer
so about maybe two three years I do n't know how many years they had a dairy farm
and you know how rough
they were slaves
they could n't go anywhere do anything
yeah
they had to stay on the farm because it 's a small you know
I did n't know any of this
yeah
but that 's a lot like you
you 're much younger than me
I was born in fifty
oh so you 're much
I 'm born in nineteen thirty nine
so you 're
in nineteen fifty
yeah
yeah
there 's a difference
yeah
Yes
so they left maybe before you were born
yes
yeah
could b-
or just about the time you were born they left Hudson
yeah
not the-
So then they went to Middletow-
%um then he came %um for the girls ' school
he became
since he did n't at farming
could n't be managed
yeah
he became
he had been a captain in the army over difficult troops yeah So that he got into the correctional facility business
I mean he got a job
the girls ' training school there needed someone
and he got into that
And he remained the rest of his life
oh
so after that they moved to Middletown
and then they went to South Portright upstate near Onianta
yeah yeah and how shall I say he rebuilt a boys ' training school
and it was so successful they named it after him now
oh I did n't know any of this
yeah
the Fred All-
yeah
he 's very very %um prominent in that field in the correc-
no no
he did a wonderful job
in fact he had the best average of rehabilitation in the country for that age oh is that nice which is not too great
but he had the best average in the country
yeah
what 's he doing now
yeah
they 're a wonderful couple
Irene died
that 's Bessie 's
yeah
%uh do you remember %uh Lenny Kocherstein and
of course
Lenny I know
and Gloria and Bessie Kocherstein I remember
yeah
Lenny you said he was the husband
yeah
alright
it was Lenny 's yeah %uh older sister
so she was her fi-
she 's a little older
like I do n't know how many years older than him
like one or two years older than him
oh no
I just remember Lenny and Gloria
no I do n't remember meeting her
yeah
because Lenny was the youngest I think
no
yeah
well Lenny lived right in Hudson and his kids and all
we grew up with his kids

So him you know I knew
yeah
he used to work in our store sometimes even as a butcher
yes

they always had the catering and all that
yeah
yeah
with some kind of
they took over %uh %uh the drug store

I remember that they gave me a summer job once
right
yeah
they were always th-
now your mother must tell you the son Wayne is now in that business

yeah
yeah
I remember when they sai-
I think he 's president of the synagogue too or something

I hope that place keeps up and everything because both my parents ' plaques are there
oh yeah
tha-
yeah
yeah

I hope it continues
