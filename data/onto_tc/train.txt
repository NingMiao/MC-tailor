%huh ?
What price ?
%uh , free Free ! which is even better , yes
Wow .
mhm .
But what about you ?
%uh , then I 'll work on me .
%uh because see if I do n't get back %uh like next week it 's no big deal .
I could just stay here .
So it 's not important for me .
Right .
You see ?
So the main thing is to get your deal .
So you might not come back here ?
Right .
Got you .
See I 'm only be there for like three or four days .
Right .
So I mean if it 's going to cost me an arm and a leg it 's cheaper if I just stay here .
Right .
So you do n't need
Because I do n't have to do anything but work that day
so .
Right .
Well what happens to your work then ?
Well I just wo n't do it .
But I mean if I have to pay you know , a thousand dollars it 's not expeditious to make a thousand and That 's a big word . Those crosswords are making you use big words . pay a thousand .
Is that what it is ?
Getting better ?
uh-huh .
mhm %hm
That 's the purpose .
uh-huh .
Increase your word power .
mhm .
So %um Well you know that would be the thing .
I mean there 's no way
I 'm sure you 're not going to get back %uh you know within a day or two of the time . You know because there 're eighteen hundred flights %uh that go back .
I 'm not on American .
On American .
On American .
They go from London .
oh this is a flight to London ?
Right .
I see .
Right .
And then %uh just get the %uh connecting flight .
Can you get me a connecting flight ?
Well that should n't be a problem .
Susan said there 's no inter-Europe flights .
Right .
Right .
No ,
I can go down to the place here and
Sure .
Sure .
%uh %uh nothing 's %uh %uh possible with Susan .
No ,
everybody who does n't have a ticket a month ago is not going to fly for the rest of the year .
So you do n't want a ticket to Milan , for nine hundred dollars ?
Well again that 's the point .
I mean if it 's going to cost that %uh It 's easier for me just to get yours than not do one .
okay
You see ?
mhm .
%um
I 'm eating a banana ,
excuse me .
It just
I see .
You know it just %uh depends on if you would just like the you know stand by
that 's the
Well
You know to have a sh-
you know
And I 'd have to stand by in London by myself .
uh-huh .
Like a big girl ,
yes .
Yes .
Exactly .
but exactly .
that 's the thing .
You know we Amazing . just pick a day %uh you know
like probably the Tuesday like the %uh first of August would be the best time .
Right .
%um Mondays sometimes people coming back
but %uh , you know nobody leaves on Tuesdays .
Well do you think it would be better to come like on that Friday the twenty - first
and then I 'd be closer to the middle of August anyways ?
%uh , well I mean Can we do that ? %mm that 's something you could do .
%uh , you know the other thing is
Because if you 're not coming anyways then Right . I do n't have to fly with you so I could just come that Friday .
Right .
Well , the other thing is that you could just stay longer .
Right .
Exactly .
Get a short flight .
Just stay longer .
Well , yeah ,
but
mhm .
Maybe you came like the twenty first %uh ,
It would be %uh a little over three weeks instead of
Right .
mhm .
I think I should go back to work
but I think it would be better if I came on the twenty first
that way then .
uh-huh .
If you can change it .
Well I can probably change it .
Because that way oh . I 'll be closer to the middle of August
and hopefully when the problems arise with David Steel , I 'm not going to even say if . %um , I can resolve it from here and not have it ruin my vacation .
uh-huh .
Right .
oh that 's true .
You know I 'd rather not have to be doing that craziness
and I 'd still be there for B B King and Etta James .
duh , duh , buh , buh , duh duh .
they there ?
What ?
What day are they here ?
Hold on .
You do n't have the paper .
oh .
Well no I got it .
I g-
%uh they 're here the twenty third
so yeah you 'd get here the twenty second .
It is true .
%um
You know
and if they did n't have room on the twenty first I could come the twentieth by myself a few days .
uh-huh .
Right .
Right .
okay .
%um , Where was that paper by the way ?
Which paper ?
The paper that
I copied it for you and gave it to you .
No . No .
I mean where was it when you told me I had it and I told you you had it .
Who had it ?
I do n't know .
I do n't know .
Where did it come from ?
It 's history .
It 's history detective .

%um The sixteenth you 'd have to stay over in Boston anyway %uh if you did that .
But again that one was n't even available the last time I called .
Right .
they said call because people do cancel .
Right .
And %uh so you know during the time we just call on a daily basis just Sure . changing .
That 's groovy .
But it 's not a problem .
I 'm excited .
The only problem will be the ticket to get to London .
But I 'll %uh see if we can get a one way and then buy another one way going back .
this ticket is to Milan ?
%uh no get it to Nice , from London to Nice .
Right .
Right .
No .
I mean coming ,
when I leave L A where do I fly to ?
London ?
London .
mhm yeah .
And then I 'll have to take a boat because there 's no inter-Europe's according to Susan .
%ah Right .
Exactly .
All the people in Europe are paralyzed .
yep .
No .
it 's great .
Well let me know .
%uh no .
I 'll go ahead and %uh do it .
okay
And %uh I 'll go and talk to the person here cause they get cheap tickets %uh okay . from London to Nice and stuff .
Is Neil still there ?
%uh yep .
yep .
yep .
Exactly .
He 's never going home .
%uh let 's see
+Saturday+ we went out to dinner with %uh , Georgio the other night . uh-huh . And %uh had a really good meal .
We 'll go there again when %uh you come .
okay .
It 's really good restaurant .
They were people who went to the jazz festival with me last year .
They own the restaurant .
oh sure .
So they 'll probably want to go with us this year .
That 's fine .
Nice people .
Cool .
Cool .
Cool .
Cool
yes yes .
So have any of your things closed ?
No .
Nothing
Nothing .
I just had a nice dream though that David was just fine . uh-huh . That he got his money in today like he 's supposed to .
Right .
That was a dream .
So he still has n't made any inroads ?
%uh %uh .
Nothing %huh ?
He 's having trouble closing his station .
uh-huh .
It may not happen .
oh god .
If that does n't happen he 'll commit suicide .
The station ?
Right .
If he does n't get the station . Probably . He 'll commit suicide .
He 'll be in bad shape .
mhm
and then that 's because everybody involved will get sued .
What do you mean ?
Everybody involved ?
Does that mean Shirl Clay ?
Probably .
Why ?
I do n't think they can
but I think they 'll try .
You know how people are .
How you doing ?
okay
good .
How are you ?
We just got the yummiest yummiest two bunch of pictures .
Two together ?
no they came separate .
They came
uh-huh
a day or two apart
I did
and they both came
What
uh-huh
oh I did n't mail them a day or two apart .
Good
are they good ?
yum yum
Who 's coming ?
I stole a few
I stole a few
oh good
whatever I took you had duplicates of .
Who 's coming
oh , okay ,
I usually try to take two -- right -- instead of ordering double prints .
yeah
and there 's one more that 's %uh -- very cute -- packed up in an envelope
The birthday %um oh yeah and the playground and the haircut
you got the general idea
then the fan and %uh fa- did the outdoor and the apples on the floor
and that 's probably
oh y-
what
and Sara running through the %um fruit order
Hold on a second .
only one person at a time
yeah
she got into your fruits
yeah
yeah
%um did the outdoor pictures come out fuzzy ?
No ,
yeah
not great .
I do n't know
could there be a reason for that ?
There could be
I do n't know what it is .
It could be a lens does n't adjust well
I 'm
Because it 's always the outdoor pictures .
right
and this
I took a lot of outdoor pictures now .
But they 're not all bad
I do n't know .
oh really ?
yeah
maybe it 's %huh could be the how you face the sun
yeah
and also I think the more bright the sun is the fuzzier it comes out for some reason .
could be when it 's too bright it just does n't handle it
yeah
mhm
okay
how are the real ones
good
go enjoy .
Anybody coming ?
how are the real ones
just great
yummy ?
I decided for a half an hour I can tell you all the that do n't come out on the letter
One minute
your little daughter she 's
Which one ?
very
the little one very
yeah
oh yes
Excuse me . Today she colored up the walls .
I 'm not used to looking out for her
and there she is with a red crayon being
oh
Well , what gives you that idea ?
The look in her eyes
She is quite
very mischievous looking very
you have %huh
this is quite
Brachalov got up in the middle of the night
yeah
and she was wet
yeah
yeah so she tells me she 's all wet .
So we have to take off the pajamas
so she tells me put them in the sun .
In the middle of the night ?
yeah
So it 's not like you know
I see that she takes the knowledge that she picks up in one place and she applies it in another place .
uh-huh
I think one of the most intelligent things she 's said so far is one time in the middle of no place , we never discussed it or anything says to me Poppy pants mommy skirt
oh she figured that out .
I thought that was pretty intelligent
What else does she say ?
The other day she 's telling
%uh Sarah 's her doll so she says Sarah you want to go to the store ?
okay
Come into the carriage .
Come
we 're going to the store .
okay
come
good Sarah .
and then you felt like you were hearing a tape recording of yourself .
Very much %uh very much
like it makes you really be careful
yeah
uh-huh
%eh she started saying whenever I would ask her where 's Sarah 's bottle I do n't know
I do n't know
so then I do n't know every time I 'm about to answer I realize how many times I really was about to say I do n't know .
mhm
Like if she 'll ask me where are the crayons . Instead of saying I do n't know , I 'll say %hm well let 's look for them because she parrots back at me I do n't know .
I do n't know .
very good
So when are you leaving camp ?
it
%uh Thursday morning I think .
Thursday Wed- Camp goes home Wednesday
Wednesday
mhm
They were told to get out .
So then you have a quiet day .
When we were kids that was our favorite day when everybody was gone
yeah
well there 's a lot of lost and found that has to be sorted then still
so
yeah
that 's your job ?
yeah
uh-huh
all right
so
yeah
Hello
I have a little visitor here .
oh how little ?
Two and a half years old
uh-huh
Looks about something
Why ?
Maybe she wants to say hello to Oma
I do n't know
I do n't know
well she 's not eighteen yet
%eh she can talk
In %eh fifteen and a half years yeah
okay
I told you about that shampoo
did I tell you ?
What shampoo
no
%um Shirley told me she has
it 's a shampoo that 's herbal oils
yeah
and you mix them together
mhm mhm
and then you take two drops of this mixture
and you put it into a squeeze bottle of water
mhm
and after you wash their hair you rinse it with that .
And then you do n't rin-
again What ? You take some oil
It 's shampoo it 's to prevent lice
So the shampoo that they have has Rosemarin oil in it .
yeah
that 's the one that 's supposed to be most effective .
To prevent ?
yeah I also have
%um %uh you can rub it behind their ears .
uh-huh
well I bought you a kit .
You can try it .
oh thank you
She said it was fantastic .
How does she know ?
Because a whole year her kids were good .
uh-huh
why
it 's a big problem in Lakewood ?
yeah
Really
yeah
Once it 's a problem It keeps going ring around the rosie
That 's right because it 's so difficult
From A to B to C to D to E
and then it goes back to A
Right
I sometimes feel like I want to keep it under control but to make sure that every %eh d- l- you know down to the last is gone
go back to tomorrow
for what did I work so hard ?
So this is supposed
You know to keep it under control is one thing
all right
so this is the
she said the kids love it
it smells nice .
I hope so
oh good .
okay
worth a try that 's for sure
An-
Right
she says after you shampoo their hair you just **shpritz** through this mixture
Right
You put two drops into a whole cup of water -- And you comb it . And just **shpritz** it through their hair
oh
uh-huh
okay
what , she uses a **shpritz** bottle like a window washer No like a squeeze bottle like a beta bottle or a squeeze bottle
yeah I have one
It comes with it .
oh
They give you everything you need .
oh oh oh oh
It 's a whole little cute kit .
mhm
he charge you a fortune ?
No
but if it works it 's worth it .
yeah
for sure
for sure
it 's
But I think I 'll give it to Tova Newberger oh okay , when is she coming ? Who 's very looking forward to be-
yeah
I just talked to Sarah Malkus who 's jumping out of her skin already
yeah
yeah
and also
When is Tova coming
Tova 's coming the sixth I think
yeah
The sixth .
Why was she going to
yeah
and she 's going to some relatives or something
I do n't know
uh-huh
that 's nice
yeah
uh-huh
is anybody coming before that ?
%um yeah
but we no-
coming Sunday
but I do n't know if we have a way of getting it to him .
%uh no
just for my pictures I 'm concerned about
%ah we 'll try
we 'll try .
okay
%um Michalam %um are they still here Farrach 's sisters ?
I met them .
I just
did I tell you who
they wanted to come see Remopolin Mikhail and %ah Chanamalka
Farrach 's sisters they 're here for the whole summer
oh right
So they wanted to see Remopolin
that 's like you know tourist attraction
uh-huh
So I met them in a park in
and we had a a nice afternoon together .
uh-huh
oh very nice
Very nice
I have n't see her kids in over a year .
uh-huh
for sure I have n't seen her Channa
she has a Channa Sarah
yeah
I have n't
and I
yeah
she wanted to name her Sarah
but she thought it would be too confusing Sarah Sarah Chimalback
so she named her Channa Sarah
yeah
uh-huh
I see
So she was born last Shavuos %eh %mm you know %uh the year and some ago
and I never saw her
uh-huh
So anyway
Your brothers are working hard in day camp ?
oh
oh yeah
but then they 're also enjoying it .
oh good
That 's what they said anyway .
You could ask them .
okay
%um I wanted to ask you did they
you know you have this lazy susan in your cabinet
yeah
Is that a common item
do they still sell them ?
It 's a Rubbermaid
yeah
yeah
you want one or two ?
probably Tupperware sells it also .
who
I was thinking Tupperware probably also sells it no
I do n't recall seeing it Tupperware
but maybe
uh-uh
if they have like a two - tiered one yeah because that would save a lot of space
and you know my cabinets are very high
and things are always
I think the two that I have is a two - tier that I took apart .
oh really
yeah
because the shelves are relat- %eh %uh
oh
your shelves are high ?
not so high
but yeah they 're pretty high one from the other .
yeah
And so what happens is to maximize the space everything 's jumbled on top of everything else
uh-huh
okay
I can look
and then it 's behind
and it 's very far
it 's just i-
whatever
yeah
all right
okay
and so I wanted to ask you do you go to these secondhand stores some or you go only when you have a free .
Sometimes
What
Brecha could use some winter jumpers
jump
She has polo shirts
jumpers
because she has polo shirts galore
I always look for jumpers
but it 's not a common thing because most kids wear pants .
It 's not common .
right
uh-huh
okay
All right
but what size is she
it 's not
she has
three t four t ?
no
for sure four t even five t
and I could always hem it
okay right
all the dresses that she 's wearing the smallest is four t the biggest is six t .
okay
jumpers
all right
we can look for them
but %uh know I could always hem them
yeah
maybe some are
or if not I mean
yeah
sometimes Osh Kosh makes
If they have it
oh yeah
I got one nice one
my sister - in - law Mindy when Sarah was born gave me a very nice blue yeah uh-huh standard I think it 's Osh Kosh stuff %um jumper
so she has a ton of polo shirts because the ones from last year still fit her .
oh uh-huh
so you know I
you were like that
you did n't get wider on top
uh-huh
well I was a little kid
you had a dress that Oma bought you
and you kept growing
but it did n't get tight on you on top .
So finally I made it into a dropped waist dre-
it was a blue dress with a white ruffle .
I bought a blue and white checkered piece of material
and I made a drop
oh and you made a skirt
It was a dropped waist dress
and a ho-
Well if you do n't see an-
What
I was saying if you do n't see any sisters in sight so you could you know
right
no sisters
this is another one of your latest so what for let her wear it
Exactly
but I was n't ready to give up this nice dress yet .
this dress
uh-huh
you know I called Chayita yesterday
and I said if anybody knows about this deal probably she does because you told me Mrs. Rubin
Her mother told me about it
Right ,
but she did n't know anything about it
I was sure she spoke to her mother for a half an hour last week
Her mother did n't call her ?
and she does n't know anything about it .
%huh
So what 's the whole idea
what are they trying to
They 're studying l-
%eh it 's for educational purposes .
meaning do I sound educated ?
no
Too bad I 'm not going back to school .
It 's too bad .
Well you go every day .
%um extra money
Yes .
it 'll come in handy .
for the while
yeah
oh good .
And how 's %uh dad doing ?
Good
he 's running that hardware .
Is he
And he likes it .
yeah ,
he likes it .
oh that 's great .
He 's doing really good .
oh gre-
and how is Margaret ?
oh she 's good .
uh-huh .

yeah ,
I just saw her tonight .
She said oh I got to write your mom a letter .
She 's had those Scottish people here for about four weeks .
uh-huh .
Right .
I know she 's been busy .
In fact I was thinking of her this morning .
And and %um yeah . yeah . I thought oh I should write her a little note .
yeah
s-
But %um did she enjoy visiting here ?
yeah
she did .
oh good .
She had a good time .
She told %um me and Johnston all about it too . %ah oh good . That she had fun
yeah .
I 'm so glad .
yeah .
oh good .
She had a good time .
oh gosh .
And what else ? %um
What else to tell you ?
There 's so many things .
I ca n't think .
But %um
How 's the kids ?
oh they 're all fine .
It 's so cute , %um
no let 's see Sunday night we got to have %uh Nancy 's children .
They stayed overnight with Grandma and Grandpa .
oh right .
And then in the morning we had %ah raspberry leaf tea -- -- and muffins .
That was the starters .
With those girls you know .
They 're such pigs .
I e-
oh anyway .
So Nancy made them pancakes and scrambled eggs and %uh -- -- sausage patties .
oh and they ate it all .
oh they had a wonderful time .
So then at supper when they were home that evening they were telling their daddy what all they did at grandma 's house .
And he said next time I 'm staying at grandma 's house .
You can stay home .
And so of course they love that you know .
So it was cute .
oh and you know what Kendall ,
%uh Nancy was -- -- cutting down the %um irises .
And you know they have those stiff pods -- mhm . -- in the fall you know .
So anyway Kendall must 've bent down and poked her eye .
So anyway Nancy took her to the doctor
and they think it scratched her cornea .
Let me tell you .
oh no .
%um there are birds here
Yes .
Lacy is laughing at me .
There are birds here that attack you .
oh re-
You 're kiddi-
No literally .
They will attack you and poke your eye out -- oh . -- and eat your eye .
oh .
because I
They 've been like attacking people .
And remember I told you I got attacked by that bird in the
Yes .
Well yeah , it was n't the same kind of bird
he was just trying to steal my food .
But there are bir-
In the park .
He wanted your sandwich .
Right .
But there are birds here that like if you walk underneath their nest or something -- Yes . -- they 'll -- Attack you . -- swoop your head and claw your head and get attached and poke your eye out .
I just saw in the paper today , a little boy got attacked
and -- oh . -- he could n't get him off his head , because you do n't see them coming .
Right .
So %um it like ate his eye or poked it out or something
and %um --
oh .
-- oh look at my plant
woops
and %um there was
yeah
so he 's blind .
oh my goodness .
Is n't that sick ?
and w-
I run in the morning
and they 're all around where I run .
oh .
Magpies .
oh Magpies .
I 've heard of that .
Is n't that gross ?
yeah
but we do n't have them .
We do n't have them .
I
No , no ,
but I mean I 've heard of a Magpie fly .
Right .
but I 've heard of that .
Or a bird .
Is n't that sick ?
oh my goodness .
oh you better be careful Amy .
I know
I did n't know it
I never heard of that .
yeah .
oh my goodness .
oh there was something else I thought of to tell you .
my god
And now I ca n't think of it .
come on
e-
%ah .
oh Daddy has been going up to church
and him and John have been spreading grass seeds .
So they 're
really ?
yeah , he 's been doing that .
Did they blacktop that yet ?
Yes
and it looks very nice .
Did you decide what kind of house you 're going to get ?
Well you know what
we 're kind of %um not did you say we were going for the log cabin because you know they have maintenance on the outside a lot .
And so %um I do n't think we 'll %uh go with a log cabin house .
%hm .
mhm .
I think we 'll %uh
Get a regular
or a thick - built they call it . You know .
But I ca n't do that
oh well
Well what about the house ?
Is that lady going to buy it ?
Well the lady is still interested . %um But not ready yet . But they have to sell their home first .
oh .
but they like the big old farm house .
So that was exciting .
What about Larry and Tim
are they still
Well the thing is we have to %um %uh see how it goes first if we 're able to sell it . You know .
And if not then we 'll think of the other
That 's good .
That 's good .
Right .
That 's what we figure .
But what was the hassle ? oh nothing . with Larry
nothing
oh nothing .
uh-uh .
oh . I thought they gave you a hassle .
No
oh no .
No .
uh-uh .
and Larry has been coming deer hunting .
oh really .
he has a blind back in the fields you know .
oh jeez .
And so %um he comes in
but I really do n't think he 'll get one because he said shooting the bow and arrow from the tree is kind of hard to do .
You know to kill a deer .
So
There was a guy doing it back there when I was out there . uh-huh . once
Right .
That 's right .
You had walked back in the woods
yeah .
Was he up in a tree ?
uh-huh .
oh well I
He was up in the tree .
uh-huh .
So In a blind . That 's what they have to do .
%hm .
Anyway .
oh Amy it is so beautiful here .
I 'll bet .
oh my gosh .
It is
oh do you know what we did Wednesday ?
Went to Wisconsin with Ann Hanson .
Or did I tell you that already ?
%mm %mm .
No
Yes .
No
%uh her sister lives up in Beaver Dam .
oh .
And Dotty , Marianne and I had wanted to go to this quilt %uh store up there .
oh right .
Yes .
I remember .
she 's on television
she has a quilting show .
yeah ,
I 've seen it .
So anyway
so we went up there
and then Ann was able to visit with her sister .
And then we went to the quilt store .
So we had a really nice time .
%hm . And of course Ann enjoyed Dotty .
And Dotty
oh really .
yeah ,
yes
she really enjoyed her .
%uh so we did that Wednesday .
oh that 's good .
yeah
and Aunt Mary Lou %um
yeah
how 's she doing ?
I do n't think she 'll get any better . You know .
%um but she 's doing
is she getting worse ?
%um very very slowly .
%mm .
But you know the doctor said she should be thankful she 's walking .
mhm .
Really .
%uh he said it 's just a miracle she 's walking because %um most of the patients that get that are in a wheelchair .
%hm So %uh really she should be thankful for that .
yeah

who the hell was that ?
somebody in the hall
hello
hello ,
can you hear me ?
barely ,
you sound like
I know
I 'm sorry .

959.97_962.15_A: is my room getting busy ?
yeah ,
I hear people
no ,
that 's in the hallway
now wh-
I live in a very
damn loud
So what have you been up to ?
%ah nothing really .
%uh yeah We 've had a big change of %uh leadership over here .
oh yeah ?
yeah ,
the base C O changed .
The clinic O I C changed .
The clinic C U nurse changed .
And , just trying to get %uh , you know , the feel for how everybody else is you know , going to respond to them , and how they 're going to respond to everybody else , has been trying , to say the least , for the past oh , probably , month or so .
yeah .
So .
Well , I mean that 's still a possibility .
I mean I just did n't -- yeah . -- feel like it was the right time when I was home last .
So .
I do n't know ,
I saw Sayonara again .
I still see you with some little gal flying around going kari san , kari san .
The supper is ready .
Get thy ass on the table .
No .
Nothing like that going on over here .
yeah .
Well I 'll tell you another a- , y- .
Did you hear about Martha getting married ?
No !
Well this supposedly is going to happen .
Now it has n't actually happened yet .
So we may be at ground zero .
I called her to chat I guess about two weeks ago .
%um . And she 'd said , oh , hey Bill . By the way , I 'm getting married .
This is a typical Martha pronouncement .
Ye-
It 's like , oh , okay .
%uh , you know , tell me about this guy .
How long have you known him and all that .
oh well I 've been dating him since April
but I have n't really told anybody .
And I thought well this is true , cause Martha you and I have been in pretty good touch since April , and you never mentioned it .
But this guy supposedly is a retired Marine pilot .
%um .
He just retired out ,
so he 's kind of thinking what he wants to do now .
I think for some reason the guy was an A six driver .
And , %uh , it seems like they just really hit it off and clicked .
And I think he has one child but he does n't have custody .
%um . So I do n't have a whole lot of scoop on this guy .
But they have n't set a date or anything .
They just decided they were going to get married , and do it real informal and all this
and
I know .
So . I asked if he was drinking buddies with Luke
and that did n't go over real good .
So I do n't know a whole lot of the scoop .
But , %uh , she 's still in San Diego and seems to have settled pretty much there .
%uh . In mine %uh , I 've changed qui- .
I 'm trying to remember .
Last time I probably talked to you was what , last spring ?
yeah .
I know ,
we 're the world 's best at keeping in touch .
Well I 'm on the road now moving from New Orleans .
I 'm finally left The Big Easy ,
and I 'm going up to Vermont , believe it or not , for graduate school .
oh , you are .
yeah .
I finally decided to go ahead and get on the ball .
And , I knew I wanted to teach English as a second language as a career
but I 'd never really done anything about it .
So I started doing it in New Orleans as a private tutor and then got picked up by a little private school down there to teach for a couple of months And knew this was what I wanted to do
so I got it
%uh I applied and got accepted into graduate school up in Vermont ,
specializes in kicking you out into a one year Master 's program .
do that .
So this starts in late August
and I 'm on the way up there kind of meandering up to the states and seeing anybody and everybody .
So if your dead old behind was in the States , I could , you know , make a point to go by and find you
but since you 're still in -- yeah . the land of large explosions , I have n't been able to do that .
yeah .
Well your tour is what three years , Ker ,
or did you get
No , it 's only two .
I 've only got about six months left over here .
I was going to say I thought you were winding up .
Do you know where you 're going yet ?
yeah .
Twenty Nine Stumps .
You 're kidding me .
No .
aw , good deal .
I think I know some folks out there .
yeah ,
well , you know . I called the detailer ,
and , I had originally , %uh , applied for a fellowship to work with the Joint Commission &on Accreditation &of Hospitals . mhm Which would have been a year long out service fellowship up in Chicago which
the town that they had this fellowship in was -- like five minutes from where I went to college and -- Right . -- ten minutes from where I went to high school .
Right .
So I thought yeah it 'd be great . You know .
But , %uh , they picked some physician to go .
yeah .
So the only other choice they gave me was either , %uh , Great Mistakes mhm or Twenty Nine Palms .
mhm .
And , the detailer , %uh .
I said , well , let me think about it for a while .
and , probably forty five minutes after I hung up with her , she called me back , and said that she had spoken to the director of nursing out at Twenty Nine Palms mhm . and the director of nursing out there wanted me to be the department head for emergency nursing .
Wow .
So , I do n't know this lady ,
but , %um you know , I 've got my sub specialty in that
and -- Sure . with the experience that I 've got ,
so You know , I eventually got back to her and said yeah I 'll go ahead and go out there .
yeah .
Well I was going to say .
Because I know you 're still the lieutenant commander , right ?
yeah .
okay . are you looking towards
how soon would commander be coming around the pike for you Kerry ?
%ah , well , I would be in zone next year .
okay ,
so that would n't blow the department head thing if you pick up commander would it ?
But
No , no , %uh %uh .
But guess who got deep selected .
For commander ?
yeah .
Let me think .
oh , it 's got to be Barney .
oh yeah .
Well now , I also heard .
Now I think I heard this from Martha .
I heard Barney had some kind of terminal disease .
Well , Barney has cancer .
okay .
%uh he had some sort of %uh , -- -- %uh , -- -- mouth and throat cancer .
yeah .
You know he 's a big golfer .
Right .
And after they tee off they stick their golf tee in their mouth ?
oh no .
yeah ,
well they think that this cancer developed from the bug spray and the weed killer that they put on the grass .
oh man .
yeah ,
so I saw Barn- .
I was back in the States in March .
And , %uh , I saw Barney at this convention that I was at .
yeah .
And , he was as skinny as you are .
You 're kidding me .
No .
Good god .
Cause he was always built like a seal or something .
He was huge .
yeah .
And %uh , you know he had gone through chemo , and was in the process of getting radiation
so he like had you know , one hair per square inch on his head . yeah . And , %uh , could barely talk because that 's where they were focusing the radiation .
Right .
%uh , and he looked like death warmed over .
You know he
yeah .
You see the Auschwitz pictures ,
and that was Barney .
Barney &von Lipstien .
yeah .
yeah .
But , %um ,
yeah
he worked for , %uh , General %uh -- -- Krulac .
okay . okay .
You just said the magic words .
So mhm .
I got you .
yeah
I 've got another buddy who , %uh , is a marine pilot .
I 'm trying to think if you had ever met this guy .
I do n't think so .
He , %um , worked for him as an aide .
And so he was chuckling the other day , well probably the other day the other year when he heard Krulac had been selected to be the next big boy .
And he thought you know , Bill whatever happens , I 'm good to go now , I 'm golden .
oh yeah .
yeah ,
it was a real surprise to hear ,
and when I talked to Barney -- Wow . we did n't really spend a whole lot of time talking about the .
yeah .
yeah .
But you know , I asked him point blank ,
I said what was what the prognosis was .
yeah .
And he said poor .
%um , but he did n't say terminal .
yeah .
%um
okay I think I had kind of assumed that I guess from talking to Martha because she may have over glorified it .
I do n't know .
Well , you know , and Barney 's wife Barb is down in Sansabel
mhm
And I talk to her fairly frequently .
And she said that %um , mhm she just saw him a couple of months ago mhm . And that he was starting to gain weight back again .
So Super . You know , I do n't know whether they managed to get all the cancer with the chemo and the radiation or what .
yeah .
But %uh You know I knew when the list came out
I did n't even have to look , you know , because I knew that both Barney and I were , %um , eligible . mhm Not in zone but eligible .
mhm .
And I knew of anybody , he would be the one that would be deep selected .
Well , being %uh buds with old Chuck Krulac did n't hurt things a whole lot either .
oh no .
Not at all .
And , you know , when I ran into him , %uh , in March , it was at some symposium in San Diego , a Nurse Corps thing .
yeah .
And , %um , Admiral Engel , the Nurse Corps admiral was there .
And You know , Barney knows her like they 're best buds .
So , you know , I 'm
No more new pictures with vice president sons on stretchers .
%uh , no , not yet .
I was expecting to see him taping up Socks or Chelsea any day now .
Well , it would n't surprise me either .
Emergency surgeon Barney Berens flown into the White House today .
he 's talking about going to D C next .
But mhm I guess you got to spend a year in San Diego for follow up .
yeah .
oh .
And then , %uh , after the whole episode called her back later ,
did n't remember it ever happened , and said you know , we got to get together sometime .
oh jeez .
So I think this is what preempted Martha to , %uh .
All her old beaus are definitely losing it .
I think it prompted her to get married .
I 'm trying to think if I 've got any other news
I had n't been as much in touch with the other folks tha- know Martha .
I usually am at least keeping abreast of things .
I think Pete and Jennifer still there
you know she picked up lieutenant commander
yeah
I saw Jennifer at the same conference .
oh okay .
yeah
Does she still look like a Teutonic %uh pin - up ?
mhm
oh man .
Although her %uh hair color is getting a little darker .
oh really ?
yeah
%uh she 's not bleaching it out quite as much
I did n't know she was a bleached blond
Are you kidding me
oh yeah
totally noticed everything , specially like when we were on this tour .
We went to like the Schwartz club with my group .
We went there for the weekend
and it frigging like rained all weekend long .
We got there
we were like let off on top of this fucking mountain like
and we had to walk like probably like five kilometers like to the place where we were sleeping
and it was raining
and it was like thirty mile an hour wind
and it was so nasty
and we had to like walk through all that .
mhm
and %um we went to this like museum up there
and the guy had like such a heavy dialect .
It was so funny .
He was talking to this little kid
I heard him talking
and he 's like hi Stacey
I 'm like hi Stacey
I 'm like hi Sta-
I 'm like what the hell 's that ?
Because they all say like S H instead of C H
so
that 's funny
well , it 's easier .
yeah
yeah .
easier for us .
yeah
but they 're not American .
yes
well
How are things with you ?
busy
yeah ?
yeah
I guess I sent you an email
but I suppose you have n't gotten it .
What
like I have to
It 's at the university
so
yeah .
That 's what I figured .
yeah .
but my most exciting thing is that a publisher is interested in my personal ad book .
Wow .
yeah ,
so .
That 's so cool .
Thank you
so I was all excited .
And I got this letter
and I was like
I did n't know if it was a scam or something .
yeah .
Well I 'm always getting letters from vanity presses and shit .
yeah .
You know what I mean .
Where you pay them to
you pay them ,
yeah
yeah
so I looked them up in Writer 's Market
and they did do thirty percent of their publishing vanity market
so I was like okay .
So I called them up the next day
and it 's no they want to really publish it .
Wow .
but I mean the thing is they want the %uh completed manuscript in a month .
I have holy shit . fuck the idea of how I 'm going to do it
and I mean that totally does n't guarantee that they 're going to publish it .
That just means they 're more interested and they 'd like to see the whole thing .
yeah
so I asked you on my email .
I sent a message like asking people to look for funny personal ads
and I want you to send it to like everybody you know . .
okay
okay
okay
and Craig 's all busy like coming up with more pictures because I sent a couple sample pictures that he did .
yeah
yeah
so he 's all busy like coming up with enough for a whole book .
That 's so cool .
I 'm so excited for you .
I hope I get something , because I mean that 's money and that 's all I want .
yeah .
but seriously like email this to everybody you know .
I did
and then they all did
and then they all di-
I hope
I hope
I hope .
Because
That 's cool
I want stuff from all over the country
and I only have a few things from different places like from you and Diana and stuff .
yeah .
And mostly it 's from here
and you know my dad he got all excited
so he 's sending me a bunch of stuff from the Journal that he thought was funny
yeah
But , I mean I 'm totally desperately in need of really fast ads
okay So you 'll get the message though
oh that 's cool .
I 'm so happy that I have email .
I know
that 's so cool
Right now I 'm just like well
I mean it 's a pain in the ass though because I went there on Monday to like sign up for it
and I 'd filled out this form
and then like it was n't ready mhm until like today to do .
I mean you just ca n't do everything
like what the hell 's that called in English ? I have to register to be here like since I 'm a foreigner .
mhm
so I went to go to this one place like that 's only open from like eight o'clock in the morning until like twelve
and since we 're in class from nine until twelve thirty , you know I have to go like really early in the morning
That 's so funny .
I know
is n't
Well
goofy
and %um so I had to go to like this one place and like fill out this total form
and then it takes them two days
and then I have to go back ,
well I was supposed to go back today
but I did n't get up early because I was tired ,
but I have to go back tomorrow in the morning to the second place to get my visa to live here
like they ca n't do anything in like one fucking day you know
Sounds like Russia
like I know
I know
is Russian way
yeah
I know
I 'm like okay we 're a first world country
oh god that sucks
yeah
I mean it 's so funny because people talk about like I mean I guess the university and all the professors and everything
I mean there 's like over two million almost three million books in the library and stuff like that
and of course like the professors are really good
and the classes are really good
but like there 's so like ass backwards like as far as the computers %huh and like how many there are and you know
%ah it 's really funny
uh-huh
%hm
All you hear were we have lots of computers
and everything is done in the American way .
I know .
I know .
I was typing today
and the Y and the Z are like changed around
and then there are some like other special characters
and then like the apostrophe you have to push shift to get it .
and there 's like a number sign in the normal place
so like half the things I sent out today probably had like number signs instead of apostrophes
mhm .
Weird
yeah
%hm %hm well
oh look at that cute little boy walking down the street .
oh your hair is so obviously dyed , my child
And it rains every frigging day .
It 's been unlike
so glad that I do n't have pneumonia .
Especially from that weekend like up on the fucking mountain in the rain .
%hm
it 's rained every day
and of course like you ca n't just stay inside .
Like , you have to go .
%hm
yeah .
How 's school ?
%hm okay
What 's the matter ?
oh I 'm just really busy
and I would n't be near
oh first of all I have Shana 's shower coming up that I have to do .
%ah that 's right .
That 's going to be like a huge like three day effort with all the cooking and cleaning and like actually party that I have to do .
Is there anyone you can get to help you ?
%um Jessica 's going to help
and Beth might because you see , Diane is here now .
oh okay
And Diana is bored because Beth is working every day and she has class at night .
uh-huh
But she wants to go out with me
but I am like so fucking busy right now .
yeah .
I have to read sixty pages of Russian today .
It took me like five hours to do like five pages
so I just sort of quit .
mhm
I mean and she 's like she wanted me to spend the whole day with her today .
and I felt really bad
but I was like I 'm sorry
but I simply can not do that .
It 's just not an option , you know
yeah
yeah
And she 's like well maybe we can meet in the afternoon .
I was like yeah I 'll see how long it takes me to get this stuff done .
So she calls me at nine thirty in the morning to see if I want to go out
oh
And I 'm like I 'll start studying now .
So she called back at noon .
I 've only read three pages of the sixty I have to read .
uh-huh
and I 'm like well maybe we could do something later tonight .
so now I like keep pushing back the time you know
like well maybe you can come over at eight
well maybe we can do something on Friday
and it 's like I 'm not going to have the time at all until she leaves , you know
Well
it feels like a real pain in the ass .
That sucks
I know
I just have so much work to do
and It 's just not an option to not do this work because It 's just me and this other kid in the class . yeah it 's not like he 's not going to call on you .
with a scary professor
yeah
so it 's not like I can just sit there and pretend to have read all of this stuff
yeah .
and I do n't know he just gives a ton of reading Probably not remembering that he 's expecting us to do an extensive research paper , as well .
Really ?
and I 'm already up to my eyeballs in work
and Joanna Nichols is insisting that I take this independent study with her
but she does n't want to teach it
I do n't want to take it .
We do n't know what we 're doing .
She does n't want to meet me .
It 's like
Hello ?
And I still
I know
so she 's like well come up with a bibliography of dialectology stuff you want to read and see me on Tuesday
and I 'm like you obviously do n't want to do this .
I do n't want to do it .
so
oh she was on N P R last week , by the way
Really ?
that 's cool
she taught
After she was on Talk &of &the Nation
What was she talking about ?
She was talking about the origins of language
but the thing is I did n't hear it because Eric heard it in the car and he called me at work and left a message but Darren was on the line .
%uh
So then Eric got there
and we turned it on .
I only heard the last few minutes .
I heard her laugh , though .
Wow .
What 'd she do ?
Sit on a whoopie cushion ?
I do n't know
but I mean like millions of people heard her laugh .
It was pretty wild .
so anyway I 'm just so stressed out right now that I feel like crying
and it 's like the last thing I need is somebody going to me let 's go out
let 's go out
let 's go out .
It 's like I ca n't , okay .
But I feel bad because she 's only going to be here for another week .
I feel bad that you 're so stressed again .
I thought like this semester would be like better for you .
I 'm only stressed this weekend because like I have party and I have Diana and I had to finish up that book review for Language Magazine
yeah .
I did n't even read the book .
Wow
Well , I hope nobody listening to this is from Language Magazine .
but I indeed do a book notice and just all these things that after this weekend , like half of them will go away yeah You know ?
yeah
So I do n't know
I hope I go to Holland .
Would n't that be cool ?
That would be so cool because like even this weekend I was just thinking because we 're all like deciding we 're like oh where do we want to go this weekend because there 's like a cool offer %uh %um with the trains and stuff .
for Thirty marks total like up to five people can go anywhere
so it 's only like you know like five marks each within the German border for the weekend like leave
How much is that ?
%um probably like twenty bucks .
uh-huh .
So you can go for like twenty bucks I mean
but like really like four bucks each like Anywhere within Germany you -- uh-huh -- go for the weekend
so we 're going
and %um then like of you want to go outside the border then you can like pay up to the border
and then you pay an additional little fee .
Right .
And %um so we 're going to like Switzerland this weekend
but when we were all just like deciding where we wanted to go the weekend I 'm like wow I wish Linda and Eric we here .
I could just pop up to Holland and see them
%ah
yeah .
Well I 'm trying to get things done
but Carl
you know I talked to Carl .
He 's really busy
yeah
and like the board of directors is very unhappy because our American business is not doing very well
so it 's probably like a really bad time for you to be irritating Carl about this yeah being the C E O and all
yeah .
but I called him up
and he was like well I can let you know
or I 'm definitely outgoing
like we could definitely go
But did I tell you this ?
He said they might be moving .
oh no
So that means that they would n't have company housing .
Where would they be moving ?
because they 're above a furniture store right now like doing manufacturing
so
%ah
okay
He said %um but you know we 'd find a place for you because he knows it 's totally impossible to find a place in Utrecht
yeah .
It 's like we 'll find a place for you
and we can ta-
all I wanted to know All I need to know is how much are you going to pay me and what are you going to give me in this package ?
yeah yeah .
Great .
What should we talk about ?
Well I do n't know .
Tell me what 's going on in America .
I have n't seen the news in ages .
Really ?
You did d-
In the American news I mean
I know what 's going on in Russia
but
yeah .
Well let 's see .
What 's going on ? %uh
You want me to just give you some headlines ?
yeah .
Give me some headlines .
What 's Clinton up to ?
up-
yeah .
I was just going to say Clinton just came out yesterday with %uh his statement concerning affirmative action .
uh-huh .
and basically he has in the past said that he was not in favor %uh you know of making %um allowances strictly based on race
but at the same time %uh the analysis in the news shall we say the conservative analysis in the news is that Clinton just came out and said that he does n't believe in quota systems and in reverse discrimination but that he does believe that affirmative action is necessary to move %uh you know black Americans forward and to give them the opportunities that they 've been denied .
So he 's kind of walking a tight rope .
You know what I 'm saying ?
Right .
In other words l-
He 's trying to please everybody .
yeah .
Let 's see if we can make everybody happy
I think that he 's
Then he just ends up making nobody happy .
I think you 're right .
Because you know affirmative action is really under attack in the United States from many different quarters right now .
and it 's a big issue because it 's supposed to be a race
%uh color blind
we 're supposed to be race color blind
and yet it 's like contractors that are bidding you know with a high bid or higher than -- the lowest bid are still getting the contracts only because they are of ethnic protected you know black or whatever .
And it 's really you know
Right .
And then so they 're taking lawsuits to the Supreme Court and all of this
so it 's
Wow .
Another thing that just came up was that the Supreme Court said that the redistricting of the congressional districts one of which is in Georgia violated the Constitution because it was based primarily on race .
There was you know a new
What did they do i-
They were doing it because like they were trying to make it less segregated ?
They were trying to make the district majority black Americans
so therefore they drew it %uh all the way across the state .
You see what I 'm saying ?
oh right .
uh-huh .
a very narrow district
and it created a majority black district which then elected a black representative
and then it was challenged because it said well the only reason that it has been done this way is just to ensure that it was majority black
and that 's not
right
you know
Hello ?
I 'm here .
okay .
Anyway
I 'm mulling all this over .
yeah .
I mean it
So it 's interesting because we 're doing a pre-departure orientation
so we had our hot topics discussion today where we break in small groups
and we talked about like political correctness and racial prejudice and sexual harrassment , feminism and just like different topics that they might encounter in America where the people have different attitudes than here in Russia .
So that was one of the things kind of like that
But I 'm not really up on what the attitude is in America because I have n't been there in so long .
Well there 's a lot of frustration I think over the fact that there 're a number of evidences that the affirmative action program is in fact discriminating in the other direction
and people are saying wait a minute .
Why do n't we just try to give everybody an equal shot
and if someone feels that they 've been discriminated against because of their race go at it from the standpoint of trying to remedy it through the courts rather than saying that government has to give X number of contracts to minority no matter what .
Right .
And as a result some people are getting contracts just because of the color of their skin
and you know what I 'm saying
it 's still
When they might not even be the most qualified .
either they 're not the low bid
you know normally on contracts you take the low bid that meets the quality specification .
Right .
but now there have been several cases where clearly you know they did n't get it because they just were n't the right color skin .
So now Right . is that really remedying the situation
or is it 's creating a lot %uh of %uh resentment ?
And %uh Right . it 's kind of too bad .
How long
God what a mess .
oh it 's a mess .
It really is .
how long have you been there by the way ?
Over here ?
%um it 'll be three years in November .
Wow .
So you really are out of touch are n't you ?
Well I like to think I 'm not totally out of touch
Well I know what it 's like .
I was never very in touch even when I was still America
so .
oh okay .
You 're that type .
I got you .
I was always in my own world anyway
so .
Well I know what it 's like because having lived over in Korea for almost three years %um you know when you come back all of a sudden you know the society has changed a little bit you know .
uh-huh .
New terminology .
New buzzwords . And all that stuff .
Right .
Of course when you get to be over forty like me %um , you can miss that stuff just being an American anyway .
It all passes
I do n't know .
I always think when you get older you 're more informed .
When I was in college I did n't know what was going on .
I was too busy .
yeah .
I 'm thinking of %uh you know like %uh lingo that the young people come up with you know .
Younger people .
yeah .
I think I 'm more informed now than I was in college .
I was sort of out of it in college .
But %uh by the way did I tell you that I have a new job ?
Well in your email you said that you 're going to start your new job somewhere .
You did n't say what your new job was .
oh okay .
%um I 'm resigned here last week effective August tenth
and I 'll be taking the job of the director of %um the English language program of a private university %uh in Atlanta a larger university .
uh-huh .
So it 's kind of a step up for me .
it 's called Mercer University .
oh
well you 'll have to send us material from there
hey .
Now we 're talking .
do -- to our advisor . -- you send people into E S L programs ?
Well we get requests about it .
I do n't know how many people actually go because a lot of them you know do n't have a lot of money
but we get students every year that ask about it that say they have money .
Well you can be
They usually do n't come though and tell us whether or not they go .
yeah .
Well you can be sure that we will send you information because %uh you know I 've got to go down there
and we 're trying to improve the program
they 're adding thousands of dollars of %uh state of the art language %uh lab equipment and all of that
and they 're restructuring everything
so that 's what I 'm supposed to do next .
Do they have any scholarships for foreign students ?
I 've never heard of a scholarship for an English language program personally
but I think
We never did either
but I keep thinking I 'm going to find one of these days .
yeah .
I know .
I 'm sure that they pro-
You know I e-
the question of whether they have scholarships for international students %um for the regular program is a good one
and I 'd like to find out .
I 'd like to think that they do
and I think uh-huh . they might
but I do n't know yet .
Right .
it 's not going to be my particular area of expertise you know i-
Right .
that 's going to be regular program
but still I would like to know so I can tell people like you .
So were you looking for a new job
or did they just like come to you ?
Well I was looking for a new job
and I 've been looking for about a year and a half
%uh .
and %uh when I went to NASA in New Orleans you know the one that you missed
I know the one , the great one that was so much fun .
oh it was a blast
but I 'm not sure it was more fun than Miami I mean you know .
But it was fun though .
You would have enjoyed it
and as I said to you in the email %uh the Russians and the Siberians and all of these people were just hilarious .
I mean we had a nice little visit .
We really did .
%uh it 's too bad I did n't
oh I ca n't believe they were calling her Lovie .
We were in stitches to hear that she was calling herself Lovie .
oh really ?
You did n't know that ?
Well because you would n't say that .
Because in Russian it 's just you know Lyubov
but it 's just a Russian name .
I mean you would n't think of translating it into English
but the thought of people calling her Lovie in America is so funny .
Well that 's what she said .
I mean I did n't know any
Well then I mean like it 's just so her to do that that I just think it 's hysterical .
Is it ?
yeah .
You should have seen them dancing around with the crowd out there when they had this %uh %uh Carribean band or something %uh running through the streets of New Orleans .
It was kind of interesting .
uh-huh .
But %um
yeah .
And we went on a shrimp boat tour also .
It was kind of fun .
%um you know you got to sort of do that kind of weird stuff .
%um I interviewed for this job at NASA .
So that 's kind of how it got to where it was %uh you know
that was a major point to reach is do that interview
and that was a good interview
so
Right .
yeah
%uh I knew they were trying to expand their program
and I said well if you 're going to do that call me because I would be interested in an opportunity
and so I 've taken it you know .
Well that 's great .
yeah .
I 'm excited about it .
It 's g-
Well what city were you in ?
Were you far from Atlanta ?
No .
Actually %uh Branow is located north of Atlanta about fifty miles north %uh up the freeway which around here is you know not even considered to be that far .
uh-huh .
but this
And I do n't even live in Gainesville which is the city where Branow is
I commute about thirty three miles from the southwest .
It 's a forty five minute ride .
And I 'll be commuting
so you 'll be closer now . [E_S
Well actually I may be two or three miles closer .
I 'm going to be commuting down into Atlanta .
see I live north of Atlanta .
So , how are you ?
I 'm fine .
I 'm very fine .
How are you ?
I have n't talked to you in a long time .
I feel like I talk to David almost every day .
yeah
Is n't that wild ?
I do n't know what it
there 's really no difference between writing a letter and the way we correspond .
As a matter of fact , what I do is I sit down and write a letter at my own leisure , you know , at the word processor
and then late at night I send it on email --
Right
-- and there 's really no reason why we could n't have written letters like this all these years and put them in the mailbox .
Well , you know what
I do n't
I do n't know
there 's something about this that 's easier ,
I do n't know how to explain it .
That you find the email is easier ?
yeah ,
it 's this I guess that it 's no different except that you do n't have to go out and get stamps and put it in the mailbox .
I think also you know that someone 's going to be reading it the next day , not possibly in a week .
you know that what you 're saying is going to be heard .
Sometimes when you write a letter you figure eventually they 're going to get this and it 's already going to be old news
and you feel like you 're really communicating with email .
yeah .
Kind of ,
%eh even though there is a delay .
But I do n't know , it 's like cute .
Also I get a kick out of pressing all those buttons and everything .
So tell me .
okay ,
first what you have
to start off tell me about all your kids .
Start at the beginning .
Or should I
I 'll start at the end .
okay .
Avi is very cute .
yeah
like , %um , he 's nine months old already .
oh , my God .
Believe it or not .
What 's he doing ?
Tell me every-
He 's only like seven months old .
Right .
But the truth is , like all my children , he 's really only like five months old .
He 's a lump on a log . I would be surprised
oh he 's very alert ,
he 's very alert %um and very responsive and laughs and eats well .
Hello ?
No , I 'm here ,
I just do n't want to interrupt because I hate that echo thing .
okay .
okay .
%ah , %uh but he does n't move .
okay ,
well that 's normal ,
you 're not worried about that
That 's all your kids
No
but you know because he was premature , he 's getting a lot of attention .
Right .
So we go to physical therapy once a week ,
and the truth is what I 'm learning about it oh because I spend so much time with the physical therapist is that all my kids could have used physical therapy in this case .
The truth is we could all use physical therapy because it would all make us more balanced people between the right and our left hemispheres
and something about being organized internally gets you organized ext-
I 've learned a lot .
I do n't know
half of it is probably baloney ,
but if any of it 's true they all needed physical therapy .
At a very young age .
oh god .
How often do you have to take him ?
No
because they do n't like to pl-
How often do you take him ?
I take him once a week
I 'm sorry ,
what ?
Once a week .
Once a week .
okay .
mhm
%um and , %uh he does n't like to play on his stomach ,
he only likes to be on his back .
Right .
So as soon as you put him on it , he can lift his head and everything
and now he 's starting to extend his hands out even
Right
but as soon as he gets that toy , he just rolls over to play with it on his back .
oh .
So %uh .
No ,
but %uh they were all like that , every one of them .
So you do n't think personally it has anything to do with him being premature ?
Personally , no .
mhm
No .
But it does n't hurt .
But I see .
Right ,
but I see that the he-
no but it 's helping
mhm .
It 's helping him be more ,
he 's advancing better , I think .
Right .
Who knows ?
And physically he 's feeling good ?
Do n't know .
We 'll find out .
Physically he 's fine ?
yeah .
He 's fine .
He 's fine .
Fine , fine .
He was sick . once with %um an ear infection
and once he got this cough
and he was like asthmatic .
mhm .
So you know , he had to have you know %eh a mask thing %hm and these %eh you know
but it was n't
no
at home ,
nothing serious ,
Right .
Right .
%uh but %eh because those things usually return and it usually is a condition .
You know , they prepared me for that and said oh you know , but because millions of kids here have it Right a lot of kids and a lot of Hagim a lot of %uh preemies get it .
%hm
But he has n't had another attack since ,
so it was fair to assume then it was a one time thing , too .
And how did the
They said
Well , wait .
How do the kids deal with him ?
Are they happy with him ?
Are they getting jealous of him ?
Are they okay ?
oh , yeah ,
they 're fine .
They 're big .
You know , they 're not %uh
Right .
What about Jochanan ?
At the beginning
Jochanan 's five year's old .
I know .
Jochanan liked him
Jochanan liked him pretty much right away .
Everyone you know they invested so much in him , too .
At the beginning %um , it was as if there was a novelty , because they waited so long to bring him home .
mhm
Right .
And then you know the novelty 's worn off , which is good .
Right
It wore off a long time ago .
And he says %uh you know lots of people have babies in their houses .
It 's you know , they 're just another family with a baby in the house .
Right .
And that was good .
That 's the way it should be .
How do you have the kids in the house ?
Who 's in which room ?
Well , Uriel was in a room before Gabby came home .
Uriel was in a room by himself .
mhm .
And Noam and Jochanan shared .
Right .
But before we brought the baby home , we switched it , because Uriel 's room was like a bacteria haven .
when I was up it was a few weeks before we brought him home
we cleaned out the room to switch
and you know I said , we could n't put any baby in this room .
Poor Noam got him back
and Jochanan you know you can control it better .
So it 's Jochanan and Gabby and Uriel and Noam . the way they used to be together .
okay .
So you still have your office as your office ?
Right .
I 'm sitting in it right now in front of the
I was in front of the computer actually , when you called .
okay ,
and so what 's with your working ?
What 's your new working thing ?
oh .
Let 's not talk about that .
It 's depressing .
It 's depressing .
Is it depressing
or is it give you a lot of anxiety ?
%mm . A and B .
okay .
All of the above . I also have taboo subjects I do n't want to talk about .
No ,
I do n't mind talking about it ,
but I ca n't jam it into fifteen minutes .
That 's too depressing .
%um . Well , we have half an hour .
I mean , we could talk for half an hour ,
it 's just that we have to guarantee them fifteen minutes ,
so , %uh .
oh .
oh .
But then David wo n't be able to call
No ,
he has his own number .
The thing is
oh .
oh .
oh
So we have half hour for .
yeah ,
we have a half an hour .
It has nothing to do with him .
It 's very depressing and very anxiety - ridden .
Well , that summed it up .
So , really , seriously , what are your options ?
I hate
well
Thorazine ?
I do n't know .
I hate being home ,
I hate it .
I really do .
I hate being home .
You hate being home .
You feel like you want more people interaction ?
%eh it 's the lot well of
first of all , I 'm upset about what happened .
mhm
I 'm upset .
Now I 'm upset ,
I was n't upset so much when it happened because at the time I was just taking everything in stride and everything you know
gomzila tova
and everything will be okay because %eh the baby was still in the hospital
mhm
and you know I was still recovering from a
Well , you 're not working at all now ?
Like , it was a really hard experience
Are you not working at
I 'm working on
Go on
No ,
I heard you .
there is a terrible **thingy** a delay .
%um , I 'm working on my own , some private projects . Yes Right mhm . %um , which I enjoy ,
but it 's not enou-
I do n't think I have the mindset to be %um independent .
I think I need to be an employee .
mhm .
I think it 's more suitable to my personality and to
it 's my personality professionally as well as financially .
mhm .
I just think the way we manage money , it 's just better .
You like getting that paycheck once a week and not just waiting for the end of a project or something .
It 's
Right .
I enjoy the flexibility of working at home and working when I want , things like that
but I do n't enjoy the pressure of it .
Like you can
It 's always hanging over your head .
Right .
With i-
and I have no problem you know , ignoring the laundry -- Right . -- and ignoring the kids and working ,
I just do n't like ,
it 's just not suitable to me .
I mean , I do it .
I did it for a while
and I hated it also .
That was one of my kids , I think . I absolutely hated it because like I would be in the middle of like changing a kid 's diaper and the phone would ring and it would you know be a business thing and
Could be a client ,
yeah .
Right
right
and like you have to try to act mature ,
your kids are screaming in the other room
and you like have to pretend that nothing 's go- you know
and you really want to be in the other room , settling what 's going on
but you have to drop everything whenever ,
you never know .
It 's like there is a bomb waiting to go off always .
But you can never relax .
Right
and I 'd rather not be in the other room .
I 'd rather just be on the phone with the client .
Right .
But you know you also can never relax , because as soon as you sit down to read a book or do anything you 're thinking , well , I really should be doing this or you know whatever .
Well I do n't have that problem , because I do n't have a steady flow of work , either .
mhm .
It comes
and it goes
and I do n't have that many things
and I have to wait for people to refer them
and I have to go get them
and as many times as I go over every decision that I made along the way even over the last three years , and every decision was the right decision at the right time .
I mean , it was n't anything I did , you know
I mean , we had this great master plan %mm a few years ago that when I was working at the consulting company and doing freelance projects at night mhm . and going a little crazy because with three kids at home and commuting %uh three hours a day really it was hard ,
but I did n't want to give it up because it was n't so much the money it was I was trying to see if this was something I could really do . mhm . mhm . If I liked it and if I was good at it .
Right .
and when we wanted to have another baby mhm and we figured
oh you know and Phil wanted to work more .
He wanted to invest more in his career
Right .
So , we figured our plan ,
all the best laid plans , right ?
mhm
and the truth is our plans came better than they could 've .
%mm %mm
They would have if we wanted to have another baby
and then I would have %um what 's it called , a maternity leave ,
that I would take an extended one because I had been at this job for a while .
Right .
and that 's when I would try to freelance a little bit and see and feel my oats in this
but I would have a job waiting for me if I did n't like it .
She gave me actually %eh the not a hundred and twenty days .
I got it %um
she %um
what do you call it
%um what do you
she
first class mail whatever you call it %um
Registered whatever
yeah .
or
yeah
and %eh %uh it was like two weeks ago
and I 'm supposed to have like a hundred and twenty days
and I only have sixty days
and that 's not really fair
and
oh I yeah I did n't realize that there was a
I mean because I 've always had trouble with my landlords
I mean so I 've always been sort of aware that whenever I 've left that there 's that anxiety
and when you left first of all you did n't know you were going to stay there
yeah
exactly
second of all you know it 's like it all sort of like ends up
I can understand that
I can underst-
because that makes you feel like you 're making a choice that
yeah
It 's like yeah a big cut and everything
and I mean I do n't know if it 's worth kee-
I mean I 'm like okay maybe then I 'll never be able to go back you know
but I 'll
yeah
But that 's not true yeah . that you would n't ever be able to go back because you know that you know as
Others possibilities .
you know you could find another place to live
I mean you know I know of people that are still finding like lofts in Brooklyn in Williamsburg that are like cheaper that would be the kind of thing that you might want to change your living situation anyhow .
And I do n't think
I 'm still
yeah
yeah
%eh %eh %eh yeah
it 's just letting go
I have problems letting
I mean I 've had it for so long you know
I 've lived there
yeah
no I know
but it 's
yeah
I do n't think you know it 's worth h-
I mean I do n't
you know a week before I 'm saying thinking to myself well if I ever move back to New York I do n't want to live in Brooklyn anymore
oh right right
and so then I
you know this power of thought thing
but otherwise you know I 'm okay
I think I need some sort of change or something
%uh I need a cha-
you know either I 'm bored %uh you know with %uh what I 'm doing not with what I 'm doing so much with art but with my life that I need to have some you know physical change or visual change because I 've just been working and %um
Are you still doing like the set painting to make money ?
yeah
it 's been great
but I thought I 'd have more work this month than I did
and so I do n't have as much as I thought I would have because I really want to buy a laptop
and %uh I need it really badly
it 's like ridiculous now
I mean I 'm doing all this writing
and I go you know to different people 's houses
and it 's this
yeah
it would be
I mean it 's a luxury definitely
but I definitely could use it .
Well it 's a tool
it 's a tool
yeah %um
yeah
it 's a great tool .
And how are you ?
%um How you doing Gail ?
Wait
wait
wait
let 's get caught up on you first .
I mean so what 's going on with Rene ?
Rene 's great .
Rene 's good
%um he 's coming with me also
and he 's going to
When are you coming ?
%um we 're coming on the thirtieth of August .
Of August
for how long ?
Three weeks .
I 'm going to be staying with family and stuff like that .
Are you going to be in New York ?
oh yeah .
We 're not
no
I 'm the fi-
I wo n't be in New York until
You said we 're we .
%um no
I said I wo n't be in New York .
Is there a we ?
oh
oh I thought you said
No
there 's not a we
but I 'll tell you about that in a minute
oh
You 're not going to be in New York
aw come to New York .
%um I 'm not going to be in New York until October %um
and uh-huh %uh yeah so that
How 's the gig out there ?
Well %uh okay
it 's mixed
yeah and no it 's good
it 's bad
it 's weird
it 's definitely like
first of all %um is it weird like I 've been out here for about six weeks now .
It 's taking me a while to settle in .
it 's definitely like
Hot ?
oh man it 's horrible
it 's so disgusting
and
I mean I hear weather reports for there
I 'm like oh gee
I know
and I wake up in the morning
and it 's overcast
and the sun does n't shine .
The thing is in New York city it might be hot but at least like the sun is shining or you 'll get like yeah those big city breezes like coming in off the water
you know what I mean
Those big city bre-
yes I do
you get some
You know what I mean right
and here like the air does n't even move
like you 're so lucky
and then %eh it moves
like there 'll be a thunderstorm in the afternoon
And everybody runs out to try to get some air .
and it 's like and then it 's gone
and then it 's like the oppression is there again
yeah
exactly
and it 's like all this steam rising off the ground
oh hotter
but %um okay %uh
so I do n't like the weather
and I think that I feel like I 'm in the suburbs because I do n't have a car
and I feel like I need a car to get around to the places that I need to get to because %eh things are so sort of scattered around
it 's like being like at McDowell but without %um you know the fact that like somebody goes on a daily basis into town or you know those kind of things
it 's definitely like a
yeah
sure
of course
oh god
yeah
sure .
Ca n't you get a really cheap one ?
Well I 'm thinking
Like yeah a group of you ?
yeah
yeah
I 'm thinking about getting a **junkmobile** .
I wanted to get like something that I could have for a couple of years or something like that
That would be great .
and I 've been looking around
and I have n't really seen anything
oh excuse me .
I 've gotten into this bad habit of
remember when I was an undergrad and I used to watch Star Trek reruns and the Twilight Zone
oh really
your watching
I 'm watching Star Trek reruns at midnight because there 's a couple of people that I 've gotten to be friends with actually
they watch Star Trek at midnight like reruns all the time .
Not the Next Generation though
%um
You 're not into that
Star Trek the
well it 's the one with Captain Picard .
%mm .
I do n't know which one that is .
yeah that 's the earlier one .
I like the new one Next Generation
that 's pretty cool
you should look into it
uh-huh .
Anyway
You 're so bad .
Anyway
so that 's why I 'm yawning .
%um but %um anyway %uh
what was I going to say %um
so it took me a while to settle in because
and I 'm still not totally settled in .
I 've started to do %um some work
the first month that I was here I took a class in digital music %um which is like electronic you know like music editing and stuff like that .
oh cool
mhm
oh that 's great .
And because I 've been you know working with sound and I 'm interested in working more with sound and stuff
and so that was really good
there was a concert at the end of it
and I felt that 's great pretty good about my contribution to that
like it was n't really exactly what I would want
but I felt like I
oh that 's great .
yeah
so that was good
that was something that you know like being here gave me access to .
I 'm also learning a lot %um like about other things about computers like about %um you know how to do email and how to do like Email 's interesting . networking
yeah
yeah
I mean if you get a laptop and you should also try to get a modem and hook it up to a phone because then you can have
I may have to
well I mean like I have a an email address .
I do n't know who else that you know has an email address
but it 's the kind of thing that I would like
I 'm trying to t-
You can get contact with people easy .
yeah
I 'm trying to like tell people because it only costs like a local phone call
like I mean if you wanted to write to somebody in New York you could like type it up
It 's like %eh a fax %uh thing .
yeah
but it 's better
it 's even cheaper than a fax I think because it 's %um
yeah
and it goes into the computer
it 's not like with paper .
Right
it 's not with paper
and it 's cheaper because it 's the cost of a local phone call whereas a fax takes the amount of time that the phone call
oh that 's great .
No
it 's really great
and then you can get access to any information you really need
I mean if you needed something about research or whatever you
Right
right
yeah
This is amazing to me .
yeah
so yeah like the internet and all that kind of stuff
so that 's like
so I 'm learning about that
so that 's kind of cool
%uh That 's great and I 'm supposed to start teaching in September .
I mean I 'm a little bit nervous about that because I have to still put together %um like a course syllabus and
Joan get to work
it 's two weeks away .
what
I know .
I know .
I know .
We could talk about email and stuff like that .
No I 'm joking with you
but that 's okay
I 'm just joking
but
uh-huh
okay you know what
listen
hold on one second
you know what
I have to go to the bathroom
hold on one second okay
All right .
Can you bring the phone .
No
%huh ?
Say what ?
Bring the phone .
I ca n't bring the phone into the bathroom .
No it does n't stretch
hold on .
Hi
so
Hi
who 's paying for this call .
The University of Pennsylvania %um
oh fanta-
%ah America
So anyway
so
%um well yeah
it 's like I am a little ner-
I mean the thing is I 've never taught a class
well that 's not true .
I taught the same class in Germany
but it was different %um
yeah
what about upstate New York
you did it
you teach
I was teaching three D design which is really different because that was freshmen
these are like graduate students I think
oh really
oh that 's intense
well how often do you see them
it 's twice a week for th-
we meet for three hours
and %um
anyway so that 's going on
so %um
That 's great though .
but I mean it 's good
it 's weird
like I 've been having you know
the thing you 're saying like about you know like giving up the apartment in New York and those kinds of things I mean I 've been thinking about those kinds of things again also yeah . because you know I think to myself like you know I could make life easier for myself
I could come to Berlin
I could probably like you know you know you know get the paperwork in order and make a way
very easily .
not really very far
and you know it 's a question of having a few solid days to work on it you know which I just have n't had
I mean
Well I mean is it too much to ask you to just come up to Windsor and finish it after you get back .
Well we 've got to move
and I 've got to do my classes
you know but you know I 'm only teaching I think one class
so I 'll have
I just would feel better if you had it done before you turned up at the department .
I mean you 're coming back the thirty - first
you do n't start teaching until when ?
Like the fifth or sixth
I mean
%ach .
yeah .
Lord .
yeah
no
it 's n-
yeah
you know I do n't think it 's going to be a big deal
%uh I really kind of doubt that Michelle -- -- will be ready to go
%um you know she was already talking about sort of middle of September %um in the beginning of the spring .
oh god .
yeah
but she 's got more leeway than you I think .
yeah
but I 've got so much more going for me than she does . I know . You know in the larger scheme .
If they do n't tenure you we 'll sue them .
We wo n't sue them
but no
anyway so It 'll work out
so I 'm
I mean I caught myself today just getting a little sort of
Edgy .
yeah .
Well look %um
but
If you change your mind and you want to just come right up to Windsor and %um finesse the move we can do that .
No .
No
I do n't want to do that .
I do n't want to do that . because it 'll be better to do the move right away anyway because you know I ca n't come home and go right to work
I just ca n't do that .
You 'll be exhausted
yeah .
yeah
and I wo n't want to do it .
I wo n't be able to concentrate .
Right
whereas we can do things
Whereas spending time together and moving and settling in while moving is fine
yeah .
yeah .
All right
well %um I guess we 'll have to figure out our respective movements when it gets closer
but I 'm going to %um Ashfield with Greg uh-huh . tomorrow
uh-huh .
And %um
Stay up there ?
Well Greg and %uh Jimco and the kids are leaving for Japan tomorrow
uh-huh .
and %um %uh Greg 's going to go up on a hiking trip with a friend
uh-huh
but he 's going to %um stop by Ashfield to drop off the dogs .
uh-huh .
So he can take me and the baby up
uh-huh .
and then I 'll maybe come back down with him
he 's coming back down I guess ten days later .
uh-huh .
I mean he 's not staying the whole time
but he 'll come back the last weekend of the month I think they said uh-huh . and then go back down to New York
and he can probably take us then because it 's gotten to be just moving on my own is just very very difficult .
No
stay up there .
%um well and I 'm going to try and get back to work on my paper which is just ridiculous
but yeah . uh-huh . I 'm going to make an effort .
Well we can both make an effort you know
I 'll finish my book
you finish your paper you know . yeah . if you have n't already
Although you know CUNY classes start really early .
uh-huh
yeah
but then do n't you have all those holidays right at the beginning ?
That 's true .
That 's a good point .
I should really use those should n't I ?
yeah .
I have n't lined up any childcare yet
I 'm being really flaky about it
and I know I 'm going to hate myself later .
You know I really ought to take the semester off
but did I tell you this is the last year of the
is that for sure ?
It 's not for sure yet
uh-huh . %um but they 've sent CUNY a letter uh-huh . saying that the President did not ask for funding for it in his budget uh-huh . and it looks quite doubtful that the Senate is going to want to put it back in . uh-huh %um so that CUNY thinks that this is the last year of it
so I 'm reluctant to take a semester off uh-huh . considering that I would only then have one semester left .
Well anyway I mean apart from the tenure and the book you know this is not going to be a killing term for me .
I 'm only teaching one class
and I 've taught it before
uh-huh .
so you know
and I
Well once your tenure file goes in I 'll be ready to believe that
but until you get it in I think you know you should not be cutting corners on putting that file together .
Obvious .
That 's like critical for us .
yeah
yeah .
So I do n't want you to take on a lot of extra stuff at the beginning because well I it does n't make sense .
yeah .
believe me dear
once you have tenure I will have no mercy .
Good good .
Especially because you 're going to be away every summer yeah . you 're going to have to take a lot of responsibility during the year to make me feel like things are at all equal .
Right .
But not immediately this semester just because okay . you know you 've got a child now .
That 's right .
You 've got to get tenure .
That 's right .
So what was the time in New Mexico like ?
So
oh god it was horrible .
Really ?
It was horrible .
Why ?
I was so tense
and the baby was so unhappy
because you were tense
and I think that 's what it is yeah sure . because the minute I got here I relaxed completely
and she 's been just an angel .
yeah
but I mean that makes perfect sense .
yeah
I know it does .
Like dogs .
yeah .
yeah .
It was awful
you know we may get cut off at some moment
so uh-huh . if we do you know I 'll call you when I get to Ashfield .
okay .
%um it was just awful
I was stuck up on that hill
%uh they only had the Legend
uh-huh .
and they kept telling me I did n't need to rent a car which I absolutely did .
uh-huh .
%um so anyway I did n't have my own transportation .
uh-huh .
They were buying a house .
They have now bought a house .
So they were just out driving around all day .
They were completely stressed out .
They had finished looking by the time I had got there
but they were trying to make an offer
uh-huh .
and Alexis you know has no confidence about this
uh-huh .
and he had the most ridiculous realtor you 've ever seen .
uh-huh .
%um and %uh he hates owning property
and he could only buy a house for three hundred and thirty thousand dollars which was -- -- about half of what he wanted to spend
and %um he was a wreck
uh-huh .
and then Joel showed up
uh-huh .
Jemma was there
and mom was picking on Jemma like she always does even though Jemma 's a doll .
uh-huh .
Joel then turned up the day after I arrived and drove us mad .
Drove us crazy .
He was more obnoxious than he 's ever been .
uh-huh
how do you know ?
You have n't seen him in ages .
Well Jemma said so .
I think I have greater tolerance for Joel than anyone in your family does .
I think you do .
I think you do
but he really was a pain in the neck
and Jemma said it 's because his girlfriend just dumped him .
uh-huh uh-huh .
%um but anyway
so mom and Alexis were freaking out because of that
but they have no ability to set any limits you know .
So like they ca n't say to Joel look you know go away for a while
or I mean she could n't say to Judith no they ca n't come that week .
uh-huh .
you know
and we were supposed to go out to dinner one night
and they showed up unexpectedly .
They were supposed to be out .
They had gone to the Grand Canyon , and did n't expect them back .
uh-huh .
And they showed up unexpectedly
and you know mom and Alexis could not bring themselves to say we 're taking Claire out to a nice dinner
uh-huh .
see you later
this is our only evening with her yeah . you know
we want to have some time with her .
They could n't bring themselves to say that
but they were so upset that he 'd come back that the evening was just like a complete
it was painful .
Good .
And we went to a different restaurant a cheap restaurant
I mean it was just painful
and I felt so pissed off because you know there I was expecting a family vacation
I mean it 's not so much Joel
I mean oh well anyway yeah
I mean it was supposed to be a family vacation
yeah .
and it was like so stressful
I mean I did n't know why I had bothered to go .
yeah .
And then you know Eve and Seth were down in their house
and all of her energies seemed to be going towards protecting Eve from too many distractions uh-huh because Eve had to work .
yeah .
So you know you could n't go to Eve 's house
or you could n't ask Eve to have Joel and Jemma for a night uh-huh . although she was perfectly capable of having Guy and Jenny for a night .
uh-huh .
I was furious .
And then Guy came
and he was kind of a jerk you know .
He was kind of harsh with me and %um you know just sort of not very sensitive and did n't want to help with Joel and Jemma at all .
We finally made him take them out for an afternoon .
I mean it was all you know just ridiculous .
and it was n't so great with Eve either .
she said she wanted to spend a day with me .
uh-huh
you know I set aside the day she told me
uh-huh
and what it came down to was my going to her hairdresser with her uh-huh and sitting there while she talked to her hairdresser for an hour and a half . and then going out to lunch with her and her babysitter uh-huh Who brought the baby to meet us
and I thought that the reason the babysitter was staying for lunch was because she would then take the baby away again
Right
But at the end of lunch , Eve just told her to go home .
uh-huh
So we 'd have this two hour lunch with the babysitter .
uh-huh
and then we had like half an hour to go into some shops
and that was the end of the day
And I mean %uh it was almost if she was protecting herself from spending time with me .
yeah
It was really weird .
%um and then they wanted to borrow the Baby Bjorn for their ha-
they 're on a camping trip right now with the baby .
uh-huh
and I got kind of peeved
and I decided I was n't going to lend it to them
Well y-
I mean
I just did n't want to ,
Well anyway you use it , right ?
Well I have n't used it on Long Island although I did think I was going to .
Well but I mean what they were going to take it and then mail it back to you
or
yeah
yeah
but I was like forget it
I 'm going to lend this thing to
No
that 's insane .
No
they can go fucking spend some of their own money for a change
oh this is perfect timing because %um my baby 's sleeping
so that 's great .
oh good .
all right .
this was the last day I could do this
so I had to get it in right now .
I 've had this number for a month oh . and kept thinking I 'm going to do it .
I 'm going to do it .
oh I 'm so glad you called .
yeah
it 's just about ten until twelve at midday .
And your mom 's still there is n't she ?
They just left on Monday
oh okay .
and they went to New Zealand .
They 're in New Zealand right now
and they 're there until Monday I think .
okay .
okay .
I 've been leaving her messages on her machine oh . because we moved to Casper .
You 're in Casper .
yeah
we moved here .
I know
that 's very amazing .
I 'm still amazed
have n't caught my breath yet .
It all happened so very quickly .
Why did p-
%um Barry get a job or something ?
He has a job .
He got one after we came here .
oh great .
Well it is n't
I bet your mom is thrilled .
yeah
yeah
it was a good time to move .
We were gone long enough to know what it was like to live other places and enjoyed other places
and now it makes it more enjoyable to be back .
yeah .
And it was just right .
We 'd been praying for years what we were supposed to do .
We always thought we were going to move to Denver and live in my grandmother 's house that had died .
uh-huh .
But that did n't work out
and about two months ago one morning I told Barry I said honey I said really think that we 're to move to Casper
and the next day I talked to my granny
and she had moved up here last year mhm . to be by mom
and she said she had felt that for a whole year after praying that we were to move here too
she just had never said anything to anybody .
mhm .
And so she told me she had thought we should look for a house that had a big backyard and apartments that we could rent to pay the mortgage that she just thought there would be one we could find like that
so we started looking on vacation a couple of weeks ago
and we found one
it 's a hundred and fifty thousand
and I said granny I said we ca n't afford that
she said well you know if that 's what God wants he 'll provide it
so we did all the paperwork
and the bank turned us down
but then we did find the house .
We found another one for half the price for sixty - six thousand
had two apartments in the back that the lady had fixed up brand new and a big backyard for the kids with a big cedar fence
just like grandma had thought we should have we found it
and we are getting the house .
That 's great .
yep
she had prayed
Are you staying with your mom at the moment ?
yep
we 're at mom 's .
It all happened so fast we just knew it was meant to be .
Wow .
Like everything fell in place .
It 's like God was taking care of it
and we were the actors .
And Barry found a job right away .
yeah
somebody hired him over the phone long distance .
It was really weird .
So he finished school in Omaha ?
yep .
And he 's doing
%um like is it massage and stuff
is that what it
Right
well and a lot of physical therapy .
He 's at the Shepherd At The Valley Nursing Care Center oh great . working with the older people .
oh is n't that good .
oh Alison that means we get to spend so much time together when I come home .
I know .
You know a lady called me two weeks
%uh there 's a little old Christian Indian lady in Omaha that I know God provided in my life because she 's been such an encouragement to me and Barry .
oh .
And %um her and her husband
he 's %um just a real dear you know .
And about two weeks before we moved here she called me at home
and she said she 'd been praying all morning for us
and she said Alison she said I just felt real strong I needed to call and tell you that God 's taking you to your promised land
and she said %um
see she does n't know my personal life you know
we just share
you know what I mean
but she does n't know like me personally you know everything about us
but it was amazing the insight she had into us
you know she said God showed me that you guys made the best out of Omaha and you were like the children of Israel and you did n't complain and kick and scream in the wilderness you know .
yeah .
And so because you trusted God and made the best of it he 's taking you to your promised land quicker than if you 'd complained the whole time
and she just had this wonderful
oh it just gave me chills all over .
I started crying .
oh .
and she said so you know just trust Him because he 's taking you to where he wants you to be because you were faithful you know in Omaha and it was kind of like a wilderness .
We did make the best of it you know .
yeah .
But her insight was so perceptive .
I started crying .
I was like oh that 's wonderful .
And so then she says well we love you
good bye .
aw .
And that is what it was like too you know .
We made the best of it tried not to complain You really have to yeah . and made the best of it
and then this is like the promised land to us .
It might not be to someone else you know .
mhm .
But for us it is .
yeah .
And then I was thinking just like you said if you come down here around Christmas time I wo n't have to worry about getting up here you know .
I know it
that 's going to be great .
I 'm supposed to be there
I 'm going to go to Denver first
and then I 'll come up to Casper on December fourth
I know .
okay
okay
aw good .
and I 'll be there till after Christmas then .
oh and the baby .
yeah
oh Alison he is beautiful .
oh I get to be its aunt .
Auntie Alison .
Yes .
He 'll call you auntie .
oh
oh he is so beautiful
and he 's such a good baby .
I have tears thinking about
oh dear
are n't they sweet .
oh they 're just wonderful .
I feel like I could have ten .
uh-huh I am .
I 've got my fourth on the way .
are you pregnant ?
Yes it was n't on purpose .
oh then congratulations .
oh %mm I always wanted a lot remember .
Yes
oh .
God I guess it 's happening
yep .
That 's wonderful .
Well Ti the other day was teasing me because he wants to have them right in a row and like I 'd like to get pregnant in a year
and he kept
Well let me speak to him about having them in a row .
I can fill him in on that .
I know it
because he was teasing me and saying we do n't need to use anything because it 's impossible to get pregnant when you 're breast feeding
and I just laughed at him
I said no
I said my friend Alison got pregnant when she was breast feeding .
I 'm sorry
yeah .
you know I wanted to wait a long time to have this next one
but it 'll be okay yeah . because like Audrey was n't intended but I would n't trade her for anything .
yeah .
aw is n't that good .
aw
and little Audrey
And it 'll be okay because the little house we have has four bedrooms .
she 'll be more than two when I come home
no she 'll be
She 'll be nineteen months
and then when the baby 's born she 'll be like twenty - two months
so it 's not like just right after .
just
yeah
yeah it 's not like your first two %huh ?
Nope .
What 's the distance between Audrey and %um your little boy ?
Andrew .
yeah
Andrew
I do n't know .
Maybe fifteen months .
Fifteen months .
I know that I 'm going to have to figure that out once and for all because everybody asks .
So you guys are busy ?
Are you working at all ?
yeah
Well you know what Alison
A little bit ? yeah this is just so wonderful
the
Good . I took twelve months off work
and then Right . I 've you know been thinking a lot about you know going back maybe in twelve months just two days a week or something
but I really Right . did n't know about that
and the day before I left work I got a phone call from the university here that I used to work at .
Right .
And they needed somebody as what they call a tutor
oh .
you have like a one hour session with the class
and you just kind go over the lecture material with them
My
Right .
and they needed somebody right away
and it was actually starting kind of like the week I was supposed to have the baby
so they gave me two weeks off
and then I 've started doing that
and it 's only one day a week
and it 's for
like I have three classes
and then they pay me to mark all their exams and stuff
so like in the fourteen weeks I 'm doing that I 'm going to make about %um oh it 's nice a little less than three thousand dollars
so the Lord 's really looked after me that way
that will practically pay for my trip home you know like my ticket and stuff .
Right .
oh that 's wonderful
so glad
yeah
it 's great .
And I finish right before I come home
so that 's really good
and like I only have to leave him at the babysitter for four hours .
That 's fine
a momma needs A little bit of ti- a whole day off a week equivalent you know in hours I 'm sure convinced rather it 's to work a job she likes or garden or do whatever .
yeah .
Gives you more %uh time that 's better with them when you 're with them .
yeah .
Because I always taught those two mornings two to three ever since I 've had the babies
and it was just enough time you know .
it 's four year
wait
And the kids love to go see where I was teaching
and aw that 's you know if I 'd been gone all the time I do n't think they would have gone for that as much .
No .
But since it was such a short amount of time they loved to hear about what happened
and
%hm yep .
aw that 's good .
so lots has transpired here
and lots transpired at your house .
Right
we 'll have lots to catch up on .
yep
yep
I 'll have to bring pictures
we have
%huh I 'm so tired .
What time is it there ?
It 's about eight twenty .
I get real tired in my pregnancies .
So how far along are you ?
I have no idea .
I 'll have to try to figure it out
Have you seen a doctor yet ?
No .
Alison I had the best birth .
aw I 'm so glad .
I had thirty two hours of labor
but %um %uh they have the most excellent program here .
I got a community midwife
so I had a team of two midwives looked after me during the whole pregnancy
and
aw .
aw .
And %um the Jesuit who explained that to me said this is nothing against other programs that are very very wonderful you know where they give service for service 's sake --
mhm .
-- but it 's just that this thing is because of a conversion or because of their friendship with Christ -- mhm . -- in wanting to collaborate with that project , you know
mhm .
-- and the second one is that you live in the same poor area where you 're going to work .
mhm .
Now let me say that I have seen you know that this very
I took it literally
and you know I said to Jackie this is very important
and we did n't take some people because of that
mhm .
You know in fact one Jewish gal that she was just crazy about and was very very dynamic and knew Spanish and everything
but I said Jackie how will we say she 's doing this out of a commitment to Christ
mhm .
You know I mean I ca n't say I 'll agree and this is my commit-
but I have also found that as in all things human it is not perfectly kept down here .
mhm .
%uh I mean I 've met other volunteers who are you know from Spain and everything
mhm
%uh but anyway I would like to still keep that and not change that with Jackie --
mhm .
-- and I think -- mhm . -- it would be important that people knew that .
oh this is great .
Well , I mean it is great for me
I 'm using your phone call here .
uh-huh .
Well I am delighted .
oh great .
Well just tell me a little bit about your apostolate because you said to me in your letter now pray for my apostolate too
do you mean with the girls ?
Well basically in the college
yeah
%um but %uh there are a couple things that I wanted to be sure to mention to you
yeah .
One is that %um Isabelle was one of four women who made the centering prayer retreat .
okay I read that sure in your letter
okay
And another one was named Guadalupe otherwise known as Lupita .
okay .
And apparently sometimes she teaches about third grade maybe
yeah
And sometimes she brings the children to this fe alegria where you are
oh okay
So you may meet her
oh okay
Now
Guadalupe
and she 's called Lupita
Lupita
yeah okay .
Now at the end of the retreat we had a little sharing session
Yes
And she began to speak
and she became a little bit emotional
yeah
And she said she really wished she could talk more about her experience
but she could n't because she was more comfortable in Spanish .
yeah okay
And so when I said goodbye to her and everything she spoke as if she would be meeting you at some time
yeah okay
And I told her %um I was n't setting you up to be a spiritual director or anything
but I did say to her that if she felt that she wanted to talk about her prayer experience in Spanish that you would probably be able certainly to understand her but to empathize a little bit with what she was experiencing
oh sure
yeah
yeah
So I wanted to tell you that I said that %um
okay
now did you give me her number in that letter .
I do n't think so .
No okay
but Isabelle would know it because -- Yes . -- they went together .
yeah okay
and she seems t-
%eh %uh I think maybe when the school year starts or something -- yeah -- Lupita will be up there with her students doing a service project
or I do n't know just what it is -- okay -- that they do .
yeah .
okay
But
there are many fe alegria centers --
uh-huh .
-- so it 's possible that she works in one and not the one I am in
oh .
but the thing is with Isabelle I can get in touch with her .
uh-huh .
yeah .
uh-huh .
So that 's fine .
mhm .
yeah .
Then the other thing I wanted to mention to you is %um with respect to my niece and my nephew
yeah .
My nephew 's name is Jeff McDougal
yeah .
He made his vows in the Jesuits a year ago .
You said that .
I could n't remember if I did or not .
Yes .
And so he spent %uh a portion of the summer in Mexico yeah And then went to El Salvador after he finished his summer school courses .
okay .
Now , I do n't know if he will come back again .
I have a feeling he will probably spend a good portion of his life somewhere %mm in one of the Central -- yeah -- American or South American countries --
yeah .
-- but if you should meet him , I know you 'll keep an eye on him or -- oh yes -- something .
yeah .
Jeff McDougal
uh-huh .
that 's neat .
uh-huh .
yeah .
And then my niece Anne %um maybe you wo n't meet her because even though she 's raised Catholic and all that yeah Right now she does n't want to associate herself with any kind of a religious service project although she 's very interested in something like what you 're doing
yeah yeah .
%um so we 'll see what happens on that .
Where is she living ?
right now she 's in Portland .
okay okay
yeah
%uh and she 's college age
and -- yeah . -- %uh she 's been working
but she 's going to go to school
but she 's going to %um %uh take courses in Spanish
and she 's kind of going through %um conversion , life changing experience
-- yeah yeah -- and when she 's all done
I mean I know she 's moving toward a simpler lifestyle and a life of service
and yeah -- how much God is going to be in the picture and not it -- oh -- remains to be seen .
yeah .
But I have a lot of hope for her .
oh yes .
yeah yeah .
So I just was so happy when I %um you know discovered that these ladies were from the same area where you are and -- yeah -- called Peace and got the address
and when they saw your address they said oh they wanted to meet you and give you chance to meet some other people in the area
and -- yeah -- so I 'm really pleased about that .
oh that 's
yeah
yeah yeah
So am I .
it was really good
and as you said in your letter to me you saw possibilities you know just -- mhm . -- for contacts and friendship
mhm .
Everything
and %um yeah . it was really good
and of course she teaches theology
that was another thing
%mm .
Isabelle oh that 's great .
And I mean I was just amazed at all the stuff that she was telling me she does
uh-huh .
%um but very down to earth too
and she gave us a lot about the culture of the country
and it was very very worthwhile %mm oh I 'm delighted . and everything
%um is there anybody you know very very sick
or you know I pray for these sick -- %mm . -- people
like they say Karitas is not well .
Well , she was up at the college today
yeah .
She 's -- How -- -- amazing .
She 's so determined .
okay yeah
I got
But I mean it is true
she 's not well
but she 's certainly keeping going .
yeah okay
and then Annette they said had gone down a lot , gone downhill .
yeah
I have n't heard anything about her recently
yeah yeah yeah .
Those were the -- oh . -- two I wanted to
%uh you know I
We had a little meeting last Sunday to plan for the Christology workshop next summer
and yeah . A lot of ideas were shared
and
And was Annette there ?
No , no no no
No
but
But it was the group of about twenty two S H C J from various places
oh really
oh yeah
And of course Saturday was the Jubilees
and there were over three hundred people in the chapel -- yeah -- at Rosemont and for dinner
and -- oh -- it was lovely
it was just beautiful .
That 's really become a really nice tradition -- mhm , mhm -- is n't it the Jubilees and everything
yeah
yeah
That 's when Peggy called me that night oh that 's right Peggy Dougherty That 's right , yeah and %uh was telling me a little
and I felt so bad I had n't written some of it
but I did get letters off to them oh . Notes off to them anyway oh . with Don
oh good .
So yeah
and that was so good
the mail down here is terrible
do you know last week I went to the Fe Allegria main office .
mhm .
and %uh I do n't know what point these letters came into the office
but they had been sent out June seventeenth
oh .
I mean you know if it was more than two months to get -- uh-huh . in here
it 's just very disorganized .
Everything is disorganized
that 's why the lights are constantly going out
and the transportation is just
%eh but anyway Jon Ward lives through all of this .
mhm .
and he loved it
I mean he wants to come back and everything when he finishes -- %mm . his stint in Camden
but
Well that 's why Isabel wanted to bring the letter to you because she said you would be a long time before you 'd get it otherwise .
yeah yeah
%um and well anyway I wrote you a little note
you 'll be getting it %um -- oh oh nice -- through Don Ward -- oh -- %uh you know
he brought them all with him today and everything
so %um ,
but anyway %um how are things going at the college with Peg ?
Well , you know she 's worked very hard all summer
and she 's really -- 1622.82_1623.11_B: yeah . -- taking every area and working from the ground up -- yeah -- and really rebuilding and
And she 's only an interim is n't she ?
Well yes
but I mean we 're just focusing on what has to be done right now -- yeah the present -- and the long range planning that we have to do in order to make what happens now happen
Is she doing a good job ?
oh marvelous
oh I 'm so glad
And I mean there 's so much respect for her
I have not heard one negative comment anywhere .
yeah
oh good
oh then I 'm so glad .
So I think that if we 're going to make it it 's going to be now
yeah
And if we 're not it 's going to be now
but everybody 's just giving everything to make it work out
yeah yeah
So we 're hoping for the best
yeah
and how 's the enrollment , Roseanne ?
Well it 's not good
yeah
We have sixty freshman coming
yeah
and is that not good ?
that 's correct
last year we had eighty
and we were very distressed at how small the number was --
oh my goodness
oh yeah
-- and this year we have sixty .
yeah
So %uh anyway we 're really doing our utmost to do some creative planning to reverse that trend for next year
1685.48_1686.56_B: yeah yeah
So ,
Well Aunt Joyce it 's been really nice to talk to you
we 've gone over our half hour
so
oh
oh okay
because on the last phone call they came in and told us
yeah that 's what I understood was going to happen
so
yeah
well anyway maybe they 're anyone happened
but anyway you 're just a dear to have taken your time to call me because it 's a big thrill for me -- oh . -- to talk to our sisters
it -- uh-huh . -- really is
so %um I think you know we 'll be in touch
and you 're kind of as you said my liaison now with %uh Don Ward
Well I 'll be that
and I guess you can be mine with the four ladies Isabel and Lupita
and there were two others
Definitely
and I have Lupita 's you know name down --
uh-huh .
-- and yes
Isabel did say she wanted to get all of them together
but you know now I have another reason for talking to this Guadalupe you know --
mhm .
-- %um and then I 'll keep Jeff just in mind
oh thank you .
And your niece Anne
did you say her name was Anne ?
Anne Dougherty
yeah
mhm .
That 's neat .
mhm .
okay
Well it 's really nice to talk to you
oh
and take care
And
And love to everybody
okay
okay
And we 'll be in touch as time goes on
okay Roseanne
The thing about it is the city is so beautiful
but it is so trashy too
there 's parts of it where I mean nobody takes care of it
I mean there 's litter on the ground
and I mean there 's parts of the city that are just you know graffiti on the wall
and %hm . you know it 's really kind of sad because it 's such a historical city and there 's parts of it that is not taken care of at all
but anyway
so we did a service project and %um went and picked up trash you know
and %um we were all out there on the street %um that leads down to the old city
and you know all these Arabs started coming out and helping us
and their kids started coming out and helping us
and some of them would just come out and just stare you know just be like all and just kind of in amazement wondering what we 're doing
and I do n't know
I just kind of felt you know there 's more than one way to do missionary work here oh yeah . you know
so it 's really good
the people have very good impression of us down here
whenever we go into the stores they 're like you 're a Mormon
you are welcome here you know
it 's special discount for you because you 're a Mormon
you 're wonderf-
we like you
yeah
I 'll bet they give you a special discount though
we like your good American money
Some of them though
like there 's this coup-
What ?
They like your good American money .
yeah
they do .
Some of them invite us over for dinner at their house
and
Did you go ?
%um I have n't gone yet
but there 's this one guy that
he sells %um
what 's his name
his name 's %um Murphy
he has a shop
he sells sandals and stuff like that
and so he always %um like %ah invites about twelve students over at a time you know and %uh invites them over for dinner at his house
there 's a couple other people that are really good friends %um that always deal with the kids from the center that are pretty well known
and so like Omar he just sells olivewood carvings that are absolutely beautiful
and there 's a couple other people that it 's kind of fun to interact with them
and anyway it 's fun really fun .
%huh .
It 's different being down here though
there 's you know a lot differences
the food is really good though
the bread is wonderful
like everywhere you go there 's pita bread and the other kind of bread that you like dipped in herbs and spices and stuff
and it is really good
the bread down here is good
and there 's lots of fruit
there 's like %um pomegranate trees everywhere
I did n't realize that pomegranates were grown down here .
%huh .
We even have one outside of our room on our balcony .
Do they have fresh pomegranates on it right now ?
It does
you can eat em
they 're good .
oh wow
really fun .
There 's trees all over
like okay let me describe my room
it 's
you go outside
the coolest thing is that like %um the whole center is built on a hill
and so instead of
I mean it 's eight floors
but it 's not like high rise eight floors
it just kind of cascades down the mountain
you know what I 'm saying ?
yeah
you sent me that picture
so
oh yeah
so you kind of saw it
which one did I send you
is it just of the center ?
yeah
just like an aerial view .
oh yeah
okay so you know what I 'm talking about
yeah
Anyway
and so then %um like our room is on the fourth floor
mhm .
and you actually go outside to get to our room
there 's a hallway that 's outside
and then the rooms are just
I mean they look like little apartments you know that you get into
and there 's %um
the hallway is just all done in marble
and %um you know there 's trees in the hallway
and there 's ivy that grows on the wall
and you come into the room
uh-huh
%um and you know it 's got our beds and the bathroom and stuff
and then there 's a patio where you go outside
and there 's a wooden trellis that kind f bows overhead and kind of makes a little roof for us I guess
and it 's got all of these flowering plants on it and ivy
and then we have this big rose garden in front of us
and then you just have this perfect view of the city .
So you 're actually above the city
what
yeah
right
we 're above the city
we 're on mount Scopeth which is right next to the mount Olif
and so %um Jerusalem is right below us
it takes about fifteen minutes to walk -- Is -- into the old city .
Is the Jerusalem center on the highest mountain around there ?
%um it 's
yeah
well pretty close
like Hebrew University is just above us .
What 's it called ?
Hebrew University is just right above us
we go there a lot
we have access to all of their stuff %um their library and everything like that
but %um
And who 's that done by ?
who
a University
%um I think it is just a state university you know
From Jerusalem %huh ?
yeah
%ah well
no
I mean the state of Israel
yeah
ca-
I think that 's who runs it
but %um there 's a lot of people worldwide that are there
%huh
I 'm sorry
I 'm like trying to wake up
Well I thought
I guess I was an hour off
I thought it 'd be just about seven o'clock
and you 'd be wide awake by now
but You are now
I am now
we have tomorrow off too
oh do you
what 's nice is we have like four days of classes and then we have %um three days off
it 's weird though because it 's Sunday over there now %huh ?
yeah
it is
Sunday night
see we have our Sabbath on Saturday
and so it 's so easy to get confused with days
I forget what day it is because it just messes me up because Sundays you know we go out and go on field trips and everything like that
and anyways it 's confusing
But oh I 'm taking my Isaiah class
so wonderful
it 's so good .
At what ti-
I love it
What time do you normally start classes
%um at about seven forty
At seven forty
yeah
%um we have our Old Testament class in the morning every morning at seven forty
And then I usually have
%um I 'm that class is a lot
actually we study a lot down here
Surprisingly enough
but %um I have my Old Testament class
and then I go to do either %um N E S Near Eastern Civilizations
%um it 's really good
Brother Skinner teaches it
and he
What is it
N N E S
uh-huh
Near Eastern Studies
What does that stand for
I said Near Eastern Civilizations
that 's not right
No that 's a C
so
what is it
Studies Near Eastern Studies
Near Eastern Studies
that 's what it is
okay you 'll have to give me a break because I 'm a little tired
Anyway %um that 's a really cool class because you get to learn all the history behind everything
And it starts making things in the Bible make sense you know
oh yeah
you know you find out
oh okay I understand you know okay when this happened when Abraham was journeying and What was going on politically in the area what was going on culturally in the area
and all of a sudden the stories kind of make sense
And they just come to life you know
it 's really neat
I like it a lot
and %um then I have %um my Jewish Culture class %um taught by rabbi Rosen
he 's really really good really good teacher %um
and %ah that 's been interesting to learn about
yeah
Does he speak English pretty well
yeah
actually he 's British
and he speaks with this really cool British accent
I love listening to him talk
he uses all of these %um cool words
and in his British accent it just kind of sounds kind of neat
he 's a neat figure
he 's really %um energetic
and anyway %um he %ah
and then there 's this Arab Civilization class that I take %um from Brother
he 's an Arab here a very prominent Arab %um Muslim down here
he really was influential in %um getting the center built here
he worked with President Hunter a lot that knew him very well
he is so neat
and I wrote this in my letter so you 'll get it twice
but %um he was talking to us one time in one of our classes
and he was saying %um somebody asked him
he 's known as a dry Mormon down here
and so somebody asked him kind of what that meant
and he said he just started
he kind of laughed
and he started going on about how he first came in contact with the church and President Hunter
and %uh he said
and he got all choked up you know and started to cry
and %ah he you know had to stop and kind of excuse himself
but he said that he always felt like in Islam they believe that Mohammed was a prophet %hm And they believe in all the other prophets you know that Jesus was a prophet
an-
anyway
but they believe that Mohammed was the last prophet you know
and so he was the seal of the prophet
they do n't worship him or anything
and it 's funny because I learn about the Jewish religion and it 's the same thing
you see all of these divisions happening and all of these questions
and you ask
you know there 's the old joke %um if you ask %ah three Jewish men a question you 'll get four opinions
You know tha-
I mean they 're very you know
you really do
I 've talked to several of them
you really get different things because you know there 's the ultra orthodox and the reformed and the anyway %um
and so he was just saying that %ah he never thought that that was right
and he said %um whenever I am with your prophet President Hunter he says I can not explain it
it 's just a feeling inside
and then he 'd say do you know what I mean
and we were all just silent you know and just nodding our heads
and yup he says I just can not help but feel that this is a man of God
%um I took them to %uh Jill 's
and they spent two days there
and I guess she could n't take them
and their mom and dad came .
You mean in Texas ?
yeah .
And their mom and dad drove down there and got them .
mhm
Got them .
yeah .
So how are they getting back ?
Driving them
driving them back .
oh .
Darn it .
I thought I was going to get to see everybody .
Well They was supposed to %um come back like a while ago
but Jill like she keeps farting around and wo n't want to go get them
and
%mm .
So I said
and then she j-
Did she have her baby yet ?
yeah .
She had a girl .
%mm .
Six pounds or something like that .
I do n't know .
hey ai n't my concern .

You know I was gone

You 're busy with work
and
yeah .
I work ten at night to six in the morning .
Bo Bo 's happy because %uh he do n't have to go back to day care .
Right .
When do you sleep then ?
I sleep probably a couple hours in the morning and then like at nap time .
yeah .
You never did require much sleep .
No .
yeah .
So has %uh the old man and the old lady called you lately ?
No .
oh .
Ai n't worried about it .
You know your sister was %uh in Illinois recently .
She was ?
yeah .
What for ?
Her old man kicked her -- -- out of her house .
yeah .
Well Jill 's been getting the shit beat out of her and all that at
You 're kidding .
No .
Well do n't get sucked into that .
oh I 'm not .
Her baby 's got colic
and she did funny .
oh .
Sounds like a real mess .
Too bad .
So is she home for good ?
No .
He took her back ?
No .
He did n't take her back
but his %uh mom was going to buy her a car -- -- so that she 'd stay out there
and sure enough she 's staying out there .
oh yeah .
She working it .
%huh ?
She working it .
So anyway she called me a couple days before she was going to come home
and I go %um can you tell me why you would stay in a place where you know you 're not wanted in a state you know where you do n't know hardly anybody .
So then that 's when it all came out .
She said well I think her name 's Patty , Patty 's going to buy me a car .
She 's going to help me out .
I said Kara you know why she 's going to do that is because she wants the kid to stay there so she can see your grandson .
mhm .
so she got all pissed off at me .
I said you 're being used .
You 're being bought .
Man she going to be like Jill become
so I said why do n't you stand up on your own two feet .
She going to be like Jill and become a product of the state and shit live off welfare and god damn .
Then you know what she said to me ?
What .
She said
&uh , and this sounded just like something like %uh her mother - in - law or I do n't know what the hell relationsh- it would n't be mother - in - law . What %uh Drew 's mom probably is saying to her .
Kara says well I have to do what 's right for David .
oh
And I said no Kara you have to do what 's right for Kara .
And what 's right for Kara will be right for David .
That 's right .
As long as you feed him , love him and take care of him .
oh well I do n't want him to not know his daddy .
I 'm like Why ?
I
you know what
I could never be with someone who did n't love me .
Could you ?
Hell no .
I do n't get that .
I do n't get that .
Anyway so I spouted my mouth off
Well Good for you . I have to tell you
the week before I met %uh the %uh sergeant and lieutenant at the %uh Des Moines McDonald 's because they were dropping off Shawn .
Sergeant and lieutenant ?
Jennings .
%huh ?
Sergeant and lieutenant Jennings .
You talking about mom and dad ?
yeah .
%eh here 's why I call them that .
So we 're sitting there in McDonald 's p-
and I 'm
they had Shawn for a week
and %uh we 're visiting
and %uh they start in on me right away .
And you keep your mouth shut
and you do n't say this
and you do n't say that and do n't say this and do n't say that .
the whole time %uh was nothing but a big fucking lecture .
You say oh I 've got to go .
So I think I did that on purpose .
Good for you .
Well then the following weekend was father 's day .
And %uh we were supposed to all meet in Des M-
339.00_347.11_A: oh that was to drop Shawn off .
okay .
yeah .
And then we 're going to meet and pick Shawn up and see Kara and David .
I 've never seen that kid .
Have no clue what he ,
well you have n't either .
uh-uh .
So %um we get there
and there 's dad with his hands in his pocket
and he meets us out at the car
and %uh %um mom was sitting on the bench for once not huddling around dad .
And %um I said where 's Kara .
He said well she did n't come .
And I said what .
He said no she did n't come .
%uh she did n't like the last two conversations that she had with you .
She %uh did n't like what you had to say to her .
So they still backing her .
And you want to know something ?
What ?
They probably told her it was okay not to come .
They probably said yeah we do n't like how she talks to us either .
I bet ,
what do you want to bet because do n't you think they could have made her come ?
yeah .
They would 've made anybody else come .
Sure .
They would 've said get your ass in the car . Whether y-
Say god damn we do n't want to hear no fucking shit .
Let 's go .
Whether you 're thirty - six or twenty - six it do n't matter .
yeah .
You would 've been in that god damn car .
Well it was just like well we 'll show her for spouting her mouth off .
She wo n't get to see the baby .
yeah .
Exactly .
We 'll punish her .
So then he just calls .
The old man just calls me I got my message machine and says %uh yeah we want Ryan to come out .
We do n't think it 's fair that Ryan ca n't come out .
And %uh cause I said I 'm not going to meet them in Des Moines . I ca n't be with them Tad .
I lose two weeks of my life every time I 'm with them .
Mentally I ca n't take it .
Well why do you think nobody else has no -- I ca n't do it anymore . -- contact with them .
I just ca n't .
I mean that pissed me off the last time they were here
so .
But it 's never their fault .
It 's never for anything that they 've done .
I know that
and I mean you get blamed ,
you still get blamed for shit and lectured about shit that happens when you 're a kid or whatever and all that I mean .
Well I do n't get it for that
%um so then dad says now why do n't you want to go to Des Moines
and I said because I do n't .
I said I thought we 'd already been through this cause I already told them I did n't want to go to Des M&oines .
And he goes well then we 'll drive to Omaha and pick up %um Ryan
and then we 'll %uh bring him back home to Omaha .
And I said %mm . oh so you 're not
and the whole thing is that I wo n't let them stay in my house anymore . Because I ca n't have that twenty - four hour bitching and negative .
I ca n't .
I ca n't live like that .
yeah .
yeah .
You know what I 'm saying ?
mhm .
It 's just twenty - four hours .
So %um I said so let me understand this
so you 're coming ,
you 're picking him up
and you 're leaving ?
You 're not staying ?
Right .
And I go %hm well it sounds like we 're back to the same old argument .
And %um I said so you 're going to punish me because you 're offended that I do n't particularly want you to stay here in my home .
Well no it 's not punishing .
I said well then what do you call it .
I mean I just came out and said it .
yeah .
No you just do n't un-
I said no dad . I think it 's you do n't understand .
You do n't understand how you affect my family . You and mom . and more importantly how you affect me .
And he said that 's your problem .
You think too much about yourself .
And I said goodbye dad .
%hm .
And I hung the phone up .
Good for you .
why does our life have to be like this ?
I do n't get it .
Well they 're the ones who created it .
They 're n-
Why do they have to be like that ?
I do n't know
and
Dad
You know what I said to dad %um when he came up to our door and said Kara 's not coming cause she does n't like you know what I said to him
What ?
I said I hope that my sons never treat one another like this .
True .
I do n't think my kids will be that way .
And he just looked at me .
Well you 've got a point
but
pretty good
yeah .
pretty good
how about you ?
Busy , busy , busy
yeah ,
sch-
I took %um some summer courses .
I started in May .
I took an English Lit for five weeks
and then I took %um Psych and Soc which I 'm finishing up next week .
I ca n't wait .
Is it Psych like
Psychology , Introduction &to Psychology
Introduction
yeah I 've taken that .
and Sociology is a lot of work .
yeah ,
what kind of Sociology ?
It 's just general Sociology .
okay .
%um .
You have to write up journal write - ups
and stuff like grab articles out of the paper -- -- about specific topics
and I have to write a paper and hand it in by the end of next week .
mhm
There 's a lot of %uh digging information that has to go with it .
There 's a lot a work to it whereas Psych I just have to study the chapters and take my tests .
yeah .
And I 've gotten A's on all my tests .
Good .
So , I 've gotten A's for that .
I know
I hate research .
It 's hard .
It 's very hard .
And then you have t-
Well , it takes so much time .
mhm .
And %um I 've been working up until like last week .
I hurt my back picking up Shanley .
So I mean I 've worked the past two weeks .
oh you 're kidding .
So %um I 'm going back Monday though , thank goodness .
Because I do n't have any sick
Do you have to go through any physical therapy or anything like that ?
yeah ,
I 'm doing that now
yeah .
yeah ,
I went last week
and then I 'm going three times this week .
I see the doctor tomorrow .
mhm .
So hopefully I 'll get a note saying go back to work on Monday because I 've no time to use . You know for sick time and stuff ?
yeah ,
because you took time when you had your surgery on your knee too , right ?
mhm .
Exactly .
I used a lot of it up at that time .
mhm .
So , I have none left whatsoever .
I had to use up my last two vacation days because they make you do that now for some reason -- -- which is fairly new which really is n't fair
but
What do you mean
because you were out sick or
Well ,
I 've been out all week
and I said do I have any sick time
she said I had seven hours
and I said well just give me the seven hours of sick and that eight hours of holiday .
So I have eight hours worth of pay
that 's it .
uh-huh .
I said do n't use my vacation time .
She told me she had to .
oh .
Now , I have like two days left . uh-huh . Like sixteen hours which was going to cover me for at least a couple days in August so I would n't like go without a check
yeah .
but they told me they had to pay me that sixteen hours of vacation time -- %huh -- which is mandatory which I think stinks . yeah . You know ,
%hm .
but I just ca n't wait to get back to work
and
Back to normal .
yeah .
and I like taking courses
and I really like it
but I do n't like taking summer courses not like two at a time .
yeah .
It 's so crammed in mhm . for five weeks .
yeah
and we do like two chapters we have to study for tomorrow
and I only read one thoroughly
and the other one I 'm going to read and learn
so I 've got to go to the library and basically box myself in like in one of those little cubicles and just read it and learn it that way .
mhm .
Because I ca n't really concentrate unless I 'm totally away from things .
yeah .
Like I 'm home and the T V is on in the other room I can hear it .
Right .
I need to be totally isolated and block everything out .
mhm .
That 's the only way I can study .
yeah .
I mean I ca n't even study if I 'm with Patrick because I 'll sit I 'll read stuff
yeah .
like I can read a book
but I ca n't like study because I ca n't block everything out
yeah .
so
So you guys are still seeing each other ?
yeah , it 's weird because %um couple days after I wrote you **Mal** was really bummed out .
yeah
And we talked and stuff
and %um I mean I told I miss him
and I was crying on the phone .
He was crying on the phone .
mhm .
Because I said are you going to miss me ?
He said well I miss you already
and it was like you know why we doing this then .
yeah .
So I figured we 'd %um -- -- take more time give him some more time and like evaluate in like six months like in October .
mhm .
So we 've been seeing each other up until
and you know we still have been seeing each other
but I do n't like go to family things of his mhm . which is kind of weird
and I 'm like
I wrote him a letter over this past week and told him -- -- how this is not enough you know
I said you knew this was going to happen at some point
you have to make a decision
either you want us to be together
or you do n't .
yeah .
you know my feelings
and -- -- that 's just the way it has to be .
I said this is n't like it 's a new relationship .
We 've known each other for ten years
and we 've gone through the good , bad , and the ugly
yeah .
and we were still here because we love each other
so that should mean something
or that should show you -- -- you know
that should be significant somehow .
mhm .
I think it is
but %um we 're going to talk about some stuff on Friday
and then we 're spending the day together Sunday .
Is he working now ?
No , in fact he got laid off .
Did you know that ?
I think h-
I 'm not sure if he got laid off and was laid off when grandma died .
I think he was
yeah .
I think he was
but %um h-
but I do n't know he was going to do something .
Was he going to go to
He had gotten some money for school
yeah .
so he took %um English Comp which he got an A minus in I believe because he 's a really good writer .
uh-huh .
and he really writes from his soul
%um and he 's taking of all things Anatomy and Physiology which is the toughest thing he could take
yeah I know I do n't ever want to take that and he 's having a hard time with it
but he 's busting his butt
I mean he 's done some work and has gotten some really good grades and some just mediocre grades
so he wanted to prove to himself that he could do it
so he took the hardest thing he had to take forever .
Next time he 'll just be doing the A and P of the %um alcohol abusive person .
mhm .
So , he told me today he just got his test back
he thought he did really well
but he got a sixty eight
and he 's so ticked because he made some careless errors
he -- skipped one question and went on to the next
but when he wrote %um the letters in , he put it on that particular one
and then when he answered the other questions the other three were just off because they were n't in the right spot .
oh
mhm .
At the last four which were right which he would have had credit for were wrong because he put them on the wrong space .
Right .
Right .
and he was really ticked off at himself .
is that passing ?
yeah sixty eight is passing
I mean a D is passing .
yeah
well see there 's different scales that people have mhm . for grades
yeah
and sometimes %uh you know like a
I do n't know
I do n't remember how it goes
but
It 's passing
but for some particular programs you have to have at least a C or better .
mhm .
So I was lucky I got a B in English Lit
but that was like the first time I wrote a paper in like eight years .
Was that an interesting class ?
I liked it
yeah .
I did n't like the poetry . mhm . and having to analyze poetry
but I liked English Literature
I liked analyzing the stories
yeah .
I enjoyed that part
and that part once I got the hang of it was okay
yeah .
and my first paper I got a C on
and I 'd knew the story really well .
It was intelligently written
but I did n't like dig into it
mhm
and the second paper I got a B minus
and I never really liked the author of that story either .
I did n't really understand the story so well .
yeah .
Called The Misfit
I did n't like the author Flanner O 'Connery .
oh .
I 've heard of him --
-- but I 've never read anything
%um and the third one we did is Hamlet which I loved .
I love Shakespeare .
%hm .
So I had to write a paper on Hamlet
Shakespeare 's hard to understand I think .
It is because you have to keep going down to the footnotes and like learning what the words mean and stuff
mhm .
but we also watched the film
I got the movie with Mel Gibson
and oh I watched that
yeah .
and I really enjoy that kind of thing
mhm
so I wrote a good paper
I made up my little poem at the end of it .
and I got a B plus because I added more to it you know .
yeah .
it was really well - done
I really
and that was the easiest paper for me to write
I do n't know if it was because I had done two before that or if I just really enjoyed the material I was working with
yeah ,
that helps .
but I got a really good grade on that
and I got a B on the course
but
I worked really hard for it
and it was n't easy . yeah . You know
and then for Psych and Soc I got three A's on my test for Psychology
I 'm taking one next tomorrow and then one on %um next Wednesday
that 'll be my final grade .
yeah .
And then for my midterm on Sociology I got an A .
%hm .
and then %um I 'll take my other final next week
so it 's a lot
Sociology 's been a lot of work .
You going to take anymore classes after this ?
yeah ,
I 'd like to take %um Introduction to Art or History mhm . or take a philosophy and maybe
I do n't even know if I even want to tackle a Spanish yet
yeah .
I have to have a language
but I do n't really know if I really want to do it now
I think I 'm going to take it
do you guys have tele courses ?
Do you know what those are ?
What are they ?
Tele courses .
It 's like you get a video
mhm .
and you just you know watch the video at home
mhm .
and you do the reading and the work and stuff at home
and then you go in however so often they have a schedule set up to the school and take your test .
oh really ?
It 's like in a testing center .
uh-huh .
Wow .
And I 'm going to try that since I took you know a lot of French in High School
yeah .
I thought maybe it wo n't be too hard -- %huh . -- to do it that way
I 'm going to try and take it .
that would be interesting .
yeah ,
because we did a %um -- we 'll see . -- study evaluation on us .
We had to write down on Psychology
and it turned out that I 'm a what do you call it ? something observer . reflective observer when I study .
mhm .
When I do things kind of like sit back and watch the stuff
and yeah . I could be very quiet in the class .
I do n't really participate a lot in the class .
when I pay attention I 'm always there
mhm .
but I do n't like say a lot of stuff
yeah .
Not in the Psychology class I do n't .
I just do n't feel comfortable with it like with the people that are in there
yeah
so I listen
so I know everything
I comprehend everything
I know it
but
Is there younger students in
or just are they mostly adults
or ?
%um there 's a mix .
There some like nineteen twenty year old
yeah .
and there 's some married women in there
an older woman mhm . and then younger kids .
There 's a couple black people in there
yeah , that sounds about You know it 's a good mix like what it is here
yeah
but it seems like this kid who
I 'm not saying
oh I hope I 'm not being prejudice
but he 's black
and he 's like always questioning the teachers and stuff
and he thinks like well if you were told that you were brought up in a house you do what he says you know
that 's okay to learn that and stuff
and that 's okay to do to your kid
and she 's trying to teach him that it 's not okay to do that
mhm
that 's not how you build someone self - respect and to do things like that
and it 's like a couple people like to argue with her
and like they think teachers are really ignorant and stupid you know
well she got to be the teacher
she must have done something .
but yeah .
%um but it 's good
I mean it 's been interesting .
They had a hypnotist come in the other day
but I did n't want to do it just because I was skeptical of it and not really %um enthusiastic about it
yeah .
I did n't feel comfortable
like I was more interested in watching people around me mhm . like see if they really kind of like really got into it
and
I do n't know if I would ever do it
I 'd be real curious to see whether I could be hypnotized
I do n't know if I 'd -- oh I would too -- be afraid or
I 'm good
how are you ?
%eh , okay
my flight plans everything are so crazy you know
if your mom was getting married one week later uh-huh . I would 've been able to save about three hundred dollars .
oh no .
Because all the airlines are dropping their rates September fifth to six hundred and fifty dollars round trip .
oh .
but %uh it was too late
yeah .
That 's too bad .
And when I 'm coming into New York the first day apparently I 'm stuck their for twelve hours in New York .
I ca n't get a continuing flight to Buffalo until five in the evening .
I 'm landing at five in the morning .
oh .
But , hopefully , my friend Bea who was in the American class -- yeah . -- quite a few y- .
she lives in New York city in the area now .
So hopefully she 'll be meeting me for the day .
oh that 's good .
So , it should n't be too bad then , you know , if we can spend the day together
You know Hugo and Shoshana live there ?
Do you know them ?
Who ?
Hugo and Shoshana ?
I vaguely remember them .
They 're %um
I guess it 's like %um Opa 's nephew is Hugo
so it was like Ferdie 's -- yeah -- uncle or cousin or something
No I remember the name .
They 're really nice
and they come to Israel every once in a while because one of their kids lives in Israel
and
oh wait ,
is that the one that lived in Jerusalem ?
Beanie
%um . What ?
There 's some relative of Ferdie 's that lives in Jerusalem .
No , it 's not them .
Those are the Epsteins .
%ah , the Epsteins .
okay .
%um no this
But that 's your mother 's side , the Epsteins , right ? --
No actually that 's Ferdie 's side also
-- I mean your .
Ferdie 's mother 's side , right ?
Right , right .
Right .
But anyway , they live in New York City in Queens
and they 're really nice
so if you get stuck like you know I could give you their number or something .
uh-huh
yeah
well no I
hopefully it will be okay
yeah .
%um what was I going to say
%um %ah so anyway %uh what I 'm doing I 'll be just like only four days in Buffalo .
uh-huh .
And , of them , in fact , Grandma Ruth and Grandma Henning will only be there for three .
Really .
the last day I 'll be spending with my friend , Cathy .
uh-huh
And then I 'm going to Johnny
and I think we have --
When are you getting to Johnny 's ?
I 'm flying in on the twenty - eighth .
oh , I 'll probably just be leaving Michigan then .
By ya-
Like to drive to South Carolina .
uh-huh .
I
Because he 's got off from the twenty - eighth
and right now I 've got a flight that I 'm coming in like ten or eleven in the morning something like that .
okay .
And then
And when are you all coming to South Carolina ?
I-
What ?
When are you going to South Carolina ?
I mean I do n't know if he 's planning on doing it
wait
the luncheon or dinner thing is on the second , right ?
%um I do n't know .
Let me
I think your mom said their was something planned the day before for the family .
yeah ,
%um I have to find that calendar here %um .
yeah ,
it might be like there 's some dinner the night before
that could be .
I think so .
So I do n't know whether we 'll drive down the thirty - first or the first or I do n't know exactly whether he 's going to do it in you know one day or two days .
oh
yeah .
%um you know what ?
%um Cynthia 's coming and David and their kids
oh great .
And they were going to bring Ralph
but I guess they 're not sure now because they just found some kind of cancer in his brain oh no they Or a spot in his brain li-
you know he had lung cancer
is that
I know
and they were so optimistic .
anyway they just found something
and they 're going to start treating it like this week
so now they 're not sure if he can come
but mom thought it was so sweet that he wanted to come .
yeah .
But are they going to still come ?
I think so .
I mean
Who else but cousins are coming ,
do you know ?
%um , Abby 's coming uh-huh . With the baby and Michal
uh-huh ?
And , you know , they 're going to be moving to Detroit .
yeah ,
I heard that they were going to be living not far from Johnny .

%um , and mom 's not sure about Ethan and Arlene yet though
I mean Ethan and his new wife oops
%hm .
yeah .
%um Is Marianne coming ,

I do n't know .
Mom did n't mention that .
Because I know she was in touch since Dmitri 's been in that area .
I think she was in touch with l-
and Marilyn was really nice .
yeah yeah
Also it would be nice if Eileen would come .
uh-huh
You remember Eileen , right ?
Well , I 've only met them like maybe once or twice .
Because Eileen 's %uh more or less your age .
No ,
I think she 's a bit
well maybe
but I do n't know her .
uh-huh .
I might have met her once
Very sweet .
yeah ,
I hear she 's nice .
She
yeah
I was really impressed with her when we visited there two years ago .
yeah .
Tell me something

%um yeah
we all do
well no not all of us .
I do
but I 'm losing it .
I only have like a dollar left in the account
oh okay
But I can give you Dmitri 's email .
okay .
Because I have access now in the factory .
%eh this is until the Boss decides I 'm playing with it too much because right now there 's only one with his code and he 's letting me use it .
okay
uh-huh
And I 'm %eh %eh %ah
he sort of keeps on making comments about it
I 've got private messages here
I says I 'm not looking at your private messages , Reuven
I 'm only leaving my messages and collecting mine
uh-huh .
I mean he 's got the whole internet

Never seen so many dots .
Well , I see
University of Michigan education , I mean
Well I guess if
yeah ,
I guess all pretty much like universities would have E D U at the end .
yeah ?
I think .
Mom does n't have one does she ?
No , I do n't think so .
mhm .
%um , Lori , I 'm trying to figure out my plans .
I still have no idea what I 'm doing when I get to Israel
and nothing has worked out
but I 'm still coming .
You 're kidding .
No , I 'm serious .
But I 'm still coming .
did you ever %um get in touch with %uh
I had given you the fax of the number of the girl in %uh
You mean the
%um yeah
well I did fax them a letter .
It was little bit after that date like maybe a week later .
yeah ?
I faxed them a letter
and I never heard from them .
and I ha-
I basically
what she kind of said is you know come and we 'll talk sort of thing .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
so basically the one
okay
well Interns For Peace retracted their offer because they decided I was n't enthusiastic enough .
Who 's this ?
%um Interns For Peace ?
mhm .
Like they had offered me a place
and then they took it back .
But did n't you also say you still were n't that keen on them ?
Right ,
I was n't
but I still would have rather rejected them than have them reject me .
yeah .
yeah
%um and then the next place which I was so hopeful about was %um Moden Nisan
yeah
yeah
That thing at Haifa with %eh the Young Women 's Leadership Program .
yeah ?
And the woman made it sound so promising
and I waited two months to hear back
mhm .
And then I had n't heard from her
and it was after the date
so I called
mhm .
And she said oh I was going to fax you this evening
%um you know we 're not really sure what 's happening .
The position may be being redefined
%eh .
And then a week later , she called me and left a message saying oh you know they had all these things on the burner
and I should really look someplace else because they do n't know what 's going on
and
%hm .
And so I had really stopped looking for things because he made it sound so promising and like it was going to be almost fulltime .
%hm .
and now it 's like you know maybe a ten hour a week position
and it requires fluent Hebrew
and it 's just totally different than what we had talked about .
That 's a shame
And so then , meanwhile , Giva - Haviva had offered me a very short term parttime internship
yeah ,
you mentioned
by writing up something to
yeah
like helping with grant writing and miscellaneous things and living on a nearby kibbutz maybe is it Ma'anit ?
%hm .
You could be even living at David 's and Savia 's and get to Giva - Haviva .
yeah ,
but it might be nice to be on the kibbutz because then I would get to know some people .
yeah .
yeah
But anyway ,
so then %ah
but that was three months ago that they offered me that
and you know who knows if they found someone
so I faxed them about a week and a half ago .
yeah .
mhm .
And I had n't heard back from them
and so I called the New York office
and she said she 'd get back to me probably you know yesterday or today , as soon as she could talk with them .
%hm .
mhm .
Because maybe they found someone ,
I do n't know .
yeah .
So that 's
I 'm really hoping that that would work out you know ,
it 's just something
yeah .
But if not I mean I 'm just coming anyway
but I have no idea like where I 'll go
When are you planning on coming ?
And
Sometime either like mid to late September or early October .
mhm . mhm .
%um
Because I 'm thinking that I 'd like to stop in Europe on the way and visit some friends .
I have a friend in Spain and a friend in France and a friend in Germany
And they still have just one daughter ?
Yes
and I think that 's probably all because %um I think Carl feels like people like me overpopulate the world .
I have three sons now .
Really ?
yeah .
gosh
And
%uh All boys ?
Yes .
No girls .
oh my gosh
oh that 's so interesting
and you know %ah Jasmine and Sophie are taking swimming classes with Winston
oh , are they ? yeah , and I was thinking of asking him for your address
and I thought no he 's so forgetful
he 'll never remember .
It 's not worth it
Well he never would
or you know he would n't know how to get it .
I used to call him .
Well , just Winston
I know
you know ?
I used to call him every once in a while
but their niece like I think she 's the oldest Really ? uh-huh of all the kids I do n't know if you know much about the family but the one whose father got killed in Nicaragua fighting
but anyway %um No . she was living in the house
and she 's kind of
I do n't know
all I know
I do n't know if she would 've been this way if she had n't had all the problems she had in her life
but she 's kind of a goofball
and she ran up such big bills that I do n't think they 've had a phone for a whole year because he ca n't pay them off
and I do n't know if she 's still living there or not .
But I can give you my address
yeah
Wow
%huh
yeah
I 'd %uh
yeah
I 'm so gla-
you know how I have your number ?
I
I was wondering about that .
You talked to Dunya
No
no
well I did talk to Dunya
but she did n't give
well actually she was n't there the day I called
I talked to Ralph
but %um the last time I was in Honduras which is nearing two years . It 's going to be two years in January . %um I saw your husband as I was leaving the airport
and i- had my billfold out
and he wrote it on this little pad in my billfold
and you know what ?
I do n't have a lot of things
but I still have that
oh my gosh
So I thought well I 'm going to advantage of it . So %ah and I do n't remember him telling me that he saw you .
oh he probably spaced it
I think he was in the middle of some kind of work project or something maybe where you
picking up people from Peace Corps probably
yeah
Something like that
yeah
but that was right af-
I mean that 's a long time ago
that was right after %um the change of the government .
We were down because of that .
%huh
So anyway
So three boys , Barb .
yeah .
Wow .
My hands are so full
yeah
I remember you said last time that the doctor said that you had to have a baby because of your ovaries or whatever just to keep everything in order
Well if I wanted to have a child I should do it you know
and so that pushed me .
He said that we do n't want you to have a baby if it 's going to create problems
but if you want to have one this is the time
and it actually so you went all out oh that 's what it was did turn everything around for me .
I do n't know if it works that way for everybody
but those hormones kind of took care of the problems I was having .
I was starting to have the problem again befo-
like it was only maybe three months afterwards I got pregnant
but I could already feel the pains and all that
so
Wow .
I felt so good when I was pregnant
I just felt like it was a miracle
and then
Really ?
oh yeah
and then breast feeding those hormones also helped
so I feel just fine .
I hope I never have to deal with endometriosis again
but who knows after three
So your first boy is Joel or Noel ?
Noel .
Noel or Noel .
Noel .
And he 's seven and a half .
That 's how long ago that was .
uh-huh Seven and a half . We have n't seen each other s-
yeah
in a long time
uh-huh .
And your other two boys ?
Because a-
%um . Thomas is three .
uh-huh ?
It 's Thomas Enrique is his full name .
And then I have a baby who 's just going to turn ten months .
oh really
And what 's the baby 's name ?
That 's Logan Andres
%ah .
oh how nice .
So are you going to keep going ? or
so
and you two girls
oh %ah well , I thought I was done really after Thomas
not that I think two is the perfect number but I did n't expect to get pregnant a third time
that happened when I was in Honduras last time
that was really so
mhm
I was so angry at Oscar that I just knew there was no way that I could ever even think of going to bed with him you know
and that 's when it happened
but I love my little baby
and --
%huh
yeah
but
And you 're still with Oscar right
that 's
well we 're still married
but he 's doing his own thing like usual
so I pretty much take care of the crew all alone .
He calls to see how they 're doing and %huh pops in every once in a while ,
but it 's tough .
It really is
and see his daughter lives here too
wow
she 's kin-
She does ?
Well , she has since
well I think they 've been here five years now , five years this summer because we were figuring that they could apply for citizenship . Both Oscar and Lehia %um .
He 's twenty
and she 's just turned eighteen now
Wow .
he does n't live here %um .
He had kind of ,
well , so it 's a long long story
but %um at one point when I got real irritated with Oscar everybody in the family insisted that I was an idiot and I should make him take care of his children which you know I really believed when I was there
and I mean it does make a lot of intellectual sense , I guess .
But it really
I did n't want to do that to the kids
but I did
and so I sent them to stay with him
and then I felt bad about it immediately
and then he would n't let them come back
and so it turned into a situation where Lehia was really the one that wanted to come back and Oscar junior kind of %um decided that living with his father was what he wanted
mhm
And Lehia 's mom used to beg him to let her come back
and he 'd say yes
and then he 'd hang up the phone
and he 'd say I 'd never let you go back there you know .
I mean it was real stupid .
It was n't really that he wanted her around
but it
I do n't know .
People do stupid things .
%hm .
oh
%hm so they 're living with him ?
No ,
%um now how long ?
Probably two years ago then she and I worked it out where I got power of attorney from her mom because her mom always had custody
and she called me one day when there was nobody in the house but her
and I drove and got her and kind of stole her back
it was kind of exciting
I could n't believe that I 'd ever do that
but oh well it was very exciting actually because oh my gosh I mean I had to drive like two and half hours
so you know you did n't know
at any moment somebody might be coming home .
I said get your stuff ready
and I called her when I got to the corner , you know ,
it was really something
and we just packed the car full .
I mean there was n't one inch of space left
and then we just flew out of there ,
and we went to the nearest McDonalds to kind of repack where we could breathe easy
oh my gosh .
It was pretty funny
and then you know he never said a thing about it .
yeah
I know that he knew she was better off here
and she had told me that she almost committed suicide once
but you know he does n't even know any of it because it 's not that he does n't care about his kids but he 's not really capable of being a father .
You know he just .
%hm
close
So what 's Lehia doing ?
Is she studying
or did she already graduate high school ?
She 's going to be in her last year , of high school .
uh-huh .
And she 's been with her mom for two months
so she 'll be coming back tomorrow . %um
%ah .
so that 's what we have here
and then he graduated one year ago from high school
and he started going to school in Missouri
and then just out of the blue he told me that he and his buddy wanted to move back to Omaha and go to school here which was really surprising and that he was kind of saying that living with his father was n't what you know , he kind of had
his opinion on it had changed ,
but they wanted to live in an apartment .
They did n't want to burden me anymore were his words ,
but you know I know it 's that they want freedom , which is great .
They 're twenty you know .
%hm
yeah .
So they just moved in well no maybe farther , about a mile from us
they live Wow . in an apartment
and I hope it 's going to be nice .
His buddy is here actually
and Oscar is finishing some work that he was doing
and then he 's coming up sometime next week
yeah
but that 's kind of in a nutshell all the things that have been going on
and
Wow
I
Well it 's interesting .
Are you working
or are you teaching ?
oh yes .
Well I do n't teach
%um I
yeah ?
let 's see ,
well I came back
I taught adult basic education because it was really hard to get a job in home ec which is
it 's probably still that way
and I went for my masters in counseling
and uh-huh %um actually I was asked to come back and be the counselor at the American school
and that was the year I was pregnant with Noel
and I was really torn
I did n't know what to do
but my doctor did n't want me to go back to Honduras because I 'd been so sick before .
He felt that y-
mhm .
I really needed .
We did n't know how the pregnancy was going to go
but I feel like
I mean I was n't really paying that much attention to what he said
but that did influence a little bit .
so I did n't go
%hm .
and %uh , let 's see ,
what would I ,
I guess I was working part time that year doing part time counseling jobs
and then that next year well I had one offer that I had to take .
The other one was we were waiting for a principal to come back %um
mhm .
but I ended up .
I wanted to go into high school counseling
but I could n't because the principal was out on this boat they told me and he had to make the decision
it 's like oh I need to know fast because I 'm pregnant and I can not , you know , risk losing a job .
So I ended up working at the Sure . community college which was n't what I wanted at the time
but as it 's turned out it probably was the best %um
and I like it real well .
I counseled for about five years
and now I 'm in administration %um
oh great .
And guess who called here last night , looking for your address ?
Who ?
Adam Holnick
Adam Holnick ?
Why ?
Well , mommy and I were seated with his mother , I 'm sure this is why . mhm At Lisa 's wedding
uh-huh
and , yeah , we were just talking about you
mhm
and she said that she was sure Adam would love to get in touch with you ,
well guess what ,
he does
oh okay ,
I mean he 's a nice guy and all
uh-huh
Does he know that I live all the way here now ?
well he does now since Alex gave him your address
oh okay
oh that 's funny
oh okay ,
and %hm %um , there are other things I need to tell you .
I was talking to Spencer
uh-huh
and he needs to know whether there 'll be more than one set up , or just one set up
just one
now the set up would be you know , everybody being photographed in the same place
yeah ,
I know ,
yeah
just one
one .
okay
and then he needs to kno-
but just tell him I want black velvet
%huh ?
I want black velvet okay backdrop
and that 's it really
okay .
okay .
and then %uh , he needs to know how many different shots you anticipate
yeah
I have to think about that .
okay ,
okay .
we 'll
I told him how many rolls I wanted
uh-huh
%um , did he ,
I told him I wanted ten two and a quarter
okay ,
okay
but I think it might actually have to be more than ten
mhm
Well , I mean obviously , you know , the expenses go up the more he has to shoot
You know what I mean ?
yeah ,
yeah
Like there 's a relationship between the number of rolls he shoots and the cost of the whole -- oh yeah -- thing
no , I know ,
well yeah ,
because he has to take it to a place and then got a contact all of them and right stuff like that
right ,
right .
Well will all of it be black and white ?
%um yes
yes alright
and if it 's not going to cost too much , I 'd like to buy one of the rolls ,
whichever roll is the nicest one uh-huh I 'd like to buy that roll
uh-huh
okay
okay
okay ,
so you 'll have to think about how many different shots there would be like people setups
mhm .
yeah .
okay .
and then do you actually want any photograph taken during the ceremony itself ?
I do n't think so .
what do you think
okay
I think it 's tacky .
yeah .
no I do n't think it either .
okay
mommy never no-
mommy and I did not have any at all
no
I think it 's going to be hard enough ,
and %uh yeah right , and this g- I do n't need that
right
and because in that environment I do n't ,
I think you 're right on that ,
I think it would be awkward .
mhm
%um , and so I think that 's better actually ,
so , if you know ,
this way he could just take all the pictures he needs to take actually before the ceremony itself .
mhm .
and what I would like to do which you know I heard about people doing elsewhere , for the color ones during the meal %hm is you know , put some of those disposable cameras on some tables and let , you know
mhm mhm mhm
because then I 'll be sure to get pictures from my friends and stuff
mhm , mhm
yeah ,
that 's good
that 's good
everything
What do you think of that ?
yeah
that 's fine .
okay
yeah ,
I think that 's fine .
mhm
okay ,
well I told him I would get back to him .
How many rolls did you tell him ?
I told him ten two and a quarter ,
but okay I think it 's going to have to be more than that .
uh-huh
like twelve to fifteen .
uh-huh
yeah
okay
well anyway , what you do have to think about is the number of sort of people poses
mhm .
yeah .
no I do .
uh-huh
because I mean , you know , %ah , he has to allot enough time in order to accomplish all of that .
mhm
you know , it 's not as if ,
and I mean I know what it 's like at Drexel you know , when we have bunches of people getting their pictures taken
mhm
%uh , it takes a while to get them appropriately set up you know
and you have to take several shots of each grouping
and mhm all of that can take a considerable amount of time
yeah
yeah ,
I 'll think about all that .
yeah , okay
and %uh
yeah ,
I 'm also going to have a list of music that I want the D J to play
yeah ,
okay
well you know , any time you f- ,
you could probably let them know that when you come back here
you think so
I would think so
okay
I can call him and ask him , %ah ,
but I think you can probably let them know pretty close to the time itself
okay
but anyway , we 'll find out about that .
%mm
%um , i-
you know the invitations have gone out , along with all of the information on travel in Philadelphia ,
I sent a map
mhm mhm
lots of people can see how to get to the Art Alliance you know
oh that 's nice dad
%uh for all the people from out of town
uh-huh
and then I also sent them information on hotels
It turns out that the Barclay okay okay is actually the
right next door
it 's actually the best deal , because they 'll give me the best deal
oh really ,
wait ,
hold on ,
let me get a pen to write this down
uh-huh
okay
I mean the Barclay , which is right across the street , will
it 's right next door , right
yeah , right directly across the street
okay
%um , is %um ,
I think it 's ninety nine dollars for a double , and eighty nine dollars for a single ,
is that what it is Alex ?
yeah ,
it 's eighty nine for a single , and ninety nine for a double
okay ,
did you check on triples or no
%ah , no I did n't
but I could do that easily
okay
%uh , I bic-
and that 's a deal ,
that 's not %um yeah , that 's not the regular price the regular price is a hundred and twenty the regular rate ?
okay ,
so we 're taking twenty dollars off ?
yeah they 're taking twenty dollars off .
okay
at the Holiday Inn is actually the same price .
the Holiday Inn man that sounded yucky %um area was ninety nine dollars for a double , without a continental breakfast , and a hundred and fourteen dollars with the continental breakfast ,
I mean , that 's for two
m-
so , at the Barclay , do you get breakfast ?
no
no that 's the room
okay
okay
the room cost is that
okay
okay
mhm
but I mean you know as well as I do that if you want to have a relatively inexpensive meal you walk up to Diner On The Square , two blocks away
yeah .
exactly
and so %um , you know in that area of Penn you can actually eat quite inexpensively
mhm
%uh , because there are a lot %um of Asian restaurants that you can walk to within a couple of blocks
mhm
and so you know , it
no ,
I mean there 's Italian restaurants right around there too you know
yeah
I mean there are lots of places where people could eat relatively inexpensively around the Barclay
yeah
%um , and so that actually turned out to be the best deal okay %uh , that could be arranged
and so I you know sent a written statement to all of the people from out of town indicating you know what their options are
okay
and they all have the map as well
okay
okay .
so all of that is working out quite nicely
okay .
%um , as it turns out , I think the %um bed and breakfast is cheaper that
okay
well I can find out about that
I did n't do that yet
yeah ,
should I give you the name of it ?
The Reserve
Reserve
yeah ,
no , I did n't do that one yet
okay
%uh , but I could do that and let you know
yeah ,
could you ask about whether they 'll do triples there uh-huh and rooms with a bathroom ?
uh-huh
okay
Patroli 's mother and grandmothers are going to be you know
uh-huh
Is his father not coming ?
no
okay
so it 's the mother and the two grandmothers , and and his uncle ?
%uh , no , his uncle 's not coming here ,
his uncle 's going to be watching the grandfather
oh , I see
%um , no it 's %ah the person he works for who 's like a really good family friend
oh , you mean the person Charlie works for ?
yeah
oh . what 's his name
name ?
Graham
well that 's what I thought was the uncle 's name
okay
no Peter is the uncle
okay
alright ,
so that 's very nice .
Did you send out the invitations that you got ?
no , not yet
okay
I 've just been at the
%uh
you want to hear the weirdest thing ?
uh-huh
okay ,
today , I came out of the British Museum ,
and it 's just packed , you know , with tourists yes whatever , and lots of Italians
uh-huh
and I went , out around the corner , and made a 725.48_730.06_B: call home
and as I was standing in the phone booth there was this group of like like , mid teen age year kids walking by
yeah
one of them was just staring at me
and do n't tell me
okay
you c-
the young woman in the house where you stayed in Florence ?
yes
oh my god
Is n't that bizarre ?
and you talked to her ?
I , was staring at her ,
then I went out ,
and I could n't remember where I 'd seen her before
uh-huh
and then she was up waiting in front of a bus with all these Italian kids
yeah
yeah
and she just kept staring at me ,
and then as I got close she kind of like yeah walked around like , behind one of her friends or something , like she was nervous or something
right , right , right
and I 'm thinking , this is just too weird ,
and I did n't recognize it as her
right
and then I walk past the bus
and I turn around ,
and I just looked at her
uh-huh
and then I just started smiling ,
and she started smiling
and so I kind of knew it was her and everything ,
uh-huh , uh-huh but %uh , is n't it crazy ?
yeah ,
what was her name ,
Kiara ?
Kiara .
yeah ,
that 's what I thought
yeah
I thought %huh
It is a small world
yeah
%uh , so she was there with some sort of Italian group , %huh ?
well , it was like a school group , or something because it was all kids you know like yeah yeah %huh yeah right fifteen , sixteen years old
right ,
visiting the British Museum ?
yeah
uh-huh
okay ,
okay ,
very good
very good ,
I also incidentally called %um , the marriage license bureau in Philadelphia
uh-huh
okay
now if you 're getting married on saturday the ninth , the latest date on which you can apply for the license is the preceding monday
uh-huh
the preceding Monday
Now what 's the size of it compared to the other place because now I remember that
The size of the classrooms yeah %um maybe two - thirds as big
mhm mhm
But see I have fewer children too
oh that 's good
how many
About twenty or twenty - two .
oh that 's good .
mhm smallest class in the school .
%mm
They range I think from my twenty to up about thirty - two
And what grade is it again ?
Third .
okay .
They do n't like to pass thirty
but I think the seventh grade has thirty - two .
uh-huh .
And they might not all show up either .
You know you never can tell with people like that
Right .
Right .
So we shall see .
oh .
Well I 'm glad you have a smaller number now .
oh
and it 's all one grade .
all one grade
it 's
Tammy you almost wo n't know what to do with yourself
oh I think I 'll find many a thing to do somehow
oh oh gosh
so have you seen any other teachers ?
oh yes
%um see when the principal was away two of the men the second grade teacher John McCall who 's a lovely gentleman and the computer teacher Mr. Deverow covered the office for the principal
%hm %hm
I see .
So John McCall was doing it %uh last week
and Mr. Deverow was doing it the week before that .
uh-huh .
So they were very helpful .
Now will your class have much opportunity to use the computers ?
oh yes
once a week they go up uh-huh . For forty - five minutes .
I have three computers in my classroom .
Do you ?
Yes
every classroom has two or three . mhm .
oh
mhm
hey that 's good .
yeah
it 's great .
%eh they 're real old you know the ones in the room
they 're like %um uh-huh . the old Commodores I think
%mm .
but they 're I B M compatible .
That 's good
and so like what program is in it
what will you use it for ?
mhm
Well I think what he 's done
see Mr. Deverow makes these discs uh-huh to go with your work
oh .
So if you want something on you know addition of facts up to nine , he 'll have a disc that you can use to reinforce those skills
Really .
Yes ,
he 's done that .
hey that 's great .
he 's been there twenty - five years they say
Really .
yeah
so he has spent many many hours just making discs for the teachers .
That 's fantastic
mhm
and we have an art teacher , a music teacher , and a gym teacher Wow . And a fulltime librarian plus an assistant librarian who 's a Sister . My goodness . A Benedictine Sister
so you do get three forty minute periods well about three half - hour periods by the time you take them and bring them back a week
Yes
right
right .
%mm .
but I think you also have to stay with the children all during lunch and recess
oh so that 's a trade - off
I think you need that forty minutes
So when do you get your lunch
you eat with them ?
Well I think you eat with them as far as I know
do they eat in their room
is that it ?
In the classroom yes as far as I know .
aw gee
aw gee .
And I hate that .
I hate to have food in the room I do too yeah . Because it makes animals
but however
oh dear
well speaking of animals remember the fleas we had at Immaculate Conception last year that I was telling you about ?
Yes
yeah .
They 're back again .
At Immaculate Conception
oh
At Immaculate Conception
Carol Anne said she was eaten alive the other day
no
oh
And Valerie was over there helping her with something on the computer
yeah .
Valerie came home
she had welts all over her whole legs
uh-oh
I said where were you today ?
She said Immaculate Conception
I said they 're fleas
oh .
No she said
no
yes they are Valerie
oh .
So Carol Anne had to get the exterminator to put the bombs in the rooms again .
oh my goodness
They closed everything up on Friday
and they bombed out the whole place for the weekend
oh
But how did they come back
I guess all the eggs stay in the rug
is that it ?
Well I do n't know
I guess they do
but that 's a long time incubating
I mean you did n't have them through the entire year
and then
yeah
no
we did n't have them again unless they come in the windows in the summer .
%mm
See that could be it .
yeah
maybe there 's some way And they infest the rugs Because there are no animals around there right ?
Animals ?
No
no dogs or cats or raccoons
right
yeah
well there could be rats
%mm .
Rats or anything like that
**luch**
I 've never seen any .
oh .
Mice I 'm sure there are
but
yeah
oh gee
well thank God you discovered them now before school started
could you imagine
right right
Well they were in the building when we started school last year .
oh
The little kindergarteners were all bitten when they sat down on the floor .
%ah oh
Because they were covered with bandaids on their legs .
aw
And one mother wrote a note
%um dear Mrs. Henry my child is bitten by something on her legs
you must have fleas in the school
oh .
But they 're the most awful bites I 've ever had
Yes
I was in a patient 's home once
and they had fl-
oh they are awful
mhm and the marks stay with you I thought I really can commiserate with animals now little dogs when I see them scratching
oh it 's a terrible thing
mhm
yes
oh yes
oh yeah
mhm
oh
And they bleed and form this terrible scab
yeah
%eh
oh .
Well tell me about your life now ?
oh I had a wonderful time down in Baltimore
mhm .
Really good %uh symposium
I love the workshops
and %uh then in the evenings my mom and I linked up together
and we did something different each night .
oh nice
yeah
the first night we went over to the Inner Harbor
and then the second night they had scheduled %uh a cruise you know on the Spirit of Baltimore you know
oh yes .
And fortunately , that hurricane did n't affect us
it was supposed to hit that night you know and have very choppy waters and everything
but it did n't
it was a beautiful evening
mhm mhm uh-huh
and that was about a three hour cruise
oh nice .
Yes .
we were on the ship over three hours and actually moving about three I guess
and then the third night we went over to Little Italy and had a very nice Italian dinner
oh
yeah
it was fun .
oh good .
really was
and the Little Italy looks very much like south Philadelphia actually
%ah
And %um the restaurants are in the row houses
the row houses are just kind of broken through on the insides you know
and %uh
%ah mhm uh-huh
yeah
so it was fun
really was
yeah
and my mom got a lot of rest while I was oh that sounds nice . oh good mhm At the workshops all day
she was just resting enjoying herself and
Right
yeah
mhm
That 's nice she could go with you mhm
yeah
I 'm glad she could because just it happened to work out because she had three days left of vacation and it was three days
so
Right
yes
mhm
and then you had a good time at the beach I know at Stone Harbor
oh yeah
that was nice and relaxing
that was great too
it really was
so %uh the thing with this %um the hotel happened to be about %um a block away from Camden Yards which is the stadium
Yes
mhm
Well we arrived just as the traffic was going in for the game
well I did n't know there was a game
I mean I did n't even know where I was going you know
I was just following the directions
well the traffic
I was beside myself
I said oh my goodness
oh no
oh mhm mhm
and here you know as we approached the stadium we saw that 's where people were headed
and we said oh there must be a game
and sure enough there was
so for the first three days the Orioles had a home game
%ah
So the traffic was unbe-
but I did n't drive once you know I got there
but we were just walking around
and they 're such avid fans
it 's unbelievable
I mean everything was the Orioles you know
and of course I know nothing about the Orioles other that they 're a team you know
mhm .
And %uh it seems one of their players is about to break Lou Gehrig 's record or something ?
oh yes
it was on the T V mhm
oh listen to you
you know all this stuff
see I did n't you know
but in fact one of the fellows is talking about this player whom I never heard of you know and how proud they are of him and everybody
he says oh this whole town 's going to go crazy when he breaks that record
mhm
well I 've seen it on the T V
yeah
oh boy %mm
all this you know
so oh well .
So the good old Phillies we 're not quite that avid fans
No
they 've gone down to the bottom again have n't they or pretty close
oh they probably
well they won today .
Or did they ?
Yes Pat was listening to the game .
They won today in the tenth inning
oh
And they won another game this week
so that 's good you know
they 're coming up a little bit you know
but %uh Well maybe they 'll get back up there mhm they really get into these slumps
I mean it 's unbelievable
Yes
mhm
yeah
mhm
you almost hate to see them lose a game because it 's as though here goes about twelve or thirteen they 're going to lose
you know it 's like they do n't just lose one or two and then win
it 's just they get into a real slump
mhm .
Well but anyway
and and now it 's just Pat and I home this evening
oh that 's all
Mary 's away
She 's on retreat
mhm
She gets back Tuesday I think
uh-huh .
And %uh
question
did you see Annette today ?
I did
yeah
Pat and I went over
%eh we went over this morning about eleven
How 's she doing ?
mhm .
Well she looked well
%eh she 's on complete bed rest because she has the phlebitis
%hm
uh-huh .
Definitely
and they had to give her the Heprin
and of course that affects her platelets
oh And you know she said he was going to give her the chemo this Thursday
oh wow
So I do n't know
she said I 'm just disgusted
and mhm You know I could appreciate this
but I 'm thinking why does n't he hold off another week aw aye you know
I mean you know each one is counteracting the other
I mean I know it 's not an easy decision for him to make .
yeah %hm .
Nor for her either ,
but I 'm thinking oh my gosh , you know ?
But she seemed in good spirit
%hm
%um had a couple books there .
mhm
had the T V on when we got there
and she said I 'm really dozing through this you know
it was one of the new shows .
%hm yes
and then Ray Catherine I saw yesterday .
%ah %hm
and %uh
she 's going to live at New Sherry now
is that it
yeah
Yes
she told me that .
She told me that .
mhm
So %uh
The day %uh that I was leaving was the day that she moved in there , you know
that morning yet ,
well oh really oh that morning .
Thank God Irene I had cleaned the room before . oh oh my goodness because after that
You mean the day that Marcia picked you up ?
That day ?
oh
Yes that 's right .
I knew Marcia would be there like after lunch or so .
uh-huh
And I said I 'm not going to have to spend this whole morning cleaning this room . yeah Plus doing all my laundry and the wash and packing up .
Right .
So I said let me do all the big cleaning the day before . uh-huh At least
Lorraine said my Lord you 've got the room better than you had ever seen it in your life . oh Not knowing this was going to happen
oh my gosh .
Now after mass Friday morning , Dorothy says to me , how packed are you ?
I said well I said I 'm in pretty good shape .
I have to make the bed you know and take the towels out . yeah . and put the rest of my clothes in the bag .
Well she says See if you can do it in a hurry because Marie Catherine 's moving into that room .
oh my gosh
I thought was n't it good that I had done all the cleaning ?
oh yeah .
I looked at the room .
Left to vacuum the rug .
That 's all I left to the last thing .
oh
And my suitcase to all close up .
The only thing that bothers me was I had to get out and then go into like a hallway .
It was very hard remember when we were waitressing
I know
I 'm just shit labor
cacca pay
yeah
And just because we 're owners now nothing 's changed
I feel like an employee of our own you know endeavors
aw
So we were working really hard
and what I was doing I would go in early in the morning and leave kind of around ten or eleven at night
and Gabe would stay on
and we 'd close at one o'clock in the evening
and he would stay until four or five and all these gorgeous young girls that you know he insisted on hiring young beautiful girls
and I said Gabe this is going to be a problem
you 're just jealous
I said I 'm not jealous
I feel shitty that you 're not spending time with me and you 're spending time with these girls
and it 's going to lead into a problem
no you 're just paranoid
%mm
Sure enough he you know started coming home four five six in the morning
and I 'm going what 's going on
he goes oh I just need to unwind
and I said yeah
talk to the girls
yeah
well you know they 're so nice and so intelligent
I said listen
%hm
If you do n't see a problem with that you better wake up I said because how would you feel if I stayed out until four or five in the morning talking to some young guys because you know I need the conversation need to unwind
he say yeah I guess I 'd be pissed
I said well ditto
mhm
Anyway
and then I would call him like at midnight
and the phone would be busy in the restaurant
I knew who it was
it was the girl
I mean she was so stupid and obvious
yeah
and come into the restaurant
she 'd see me jump up and leave
she 'd you know come visit on her off days
and I was like yeah right
yeah
So I said to Gabe what 's going on
nothing nothing nothing
then I called one day
and the line was busy
and I called his friend because he always uses him as an alibi
and of course this guy was you know not busy on the phone
%huh you 're right
And I called Gabe back
and he said oh I was talking to that guy
I said no you were n't .
oh
Yes I was
I said no you were n't
he goes %uh okay I was n't
you want to know
I said yeah
he goes well I 've been this girl
oh
I said that 's it
goodbye
oh
So it 's been two and half weeks
it 's been hell because he 's still here you know
he comes home six in the morning
and I leave around seven or eight .
So we have one or two hours together
I try to spend all day because I do n't want to see him
and it 's just been really hard because he 's like let 's talk
let 's talk
and as far as I 'm concerned we have nothing more to talk about
yeah
He said well you know I never really wanted you physically you know
if this is a problem then I guess the chemistry between us has n't been good
but I love you more than anybody else in the whole world
I 'm going yeah %um sorry you know I need more
I think I deserve more than this
yeah
Well you know with other women it 's better
but you know I do n't know
but I love you
and it 's like Good
well let 's stay sister and brother
and let me keep in touch
yeah
So I do n't know
and it 's really hard
I mean I 'm just saying this so easily
I 'm sure it 's the same for you
No I know
I 'm the same way
yeah
And you have a kid too so you 're Exactly Even more so
how is your baby ?
He 's wonderful
Your young man I should say
Yes
he 's going to be three in January
Unbelievable
Can you believe it ?
No
I know
It goes so fast
it 's ridiculous
I know
and how are you doing it
I mean you guys had a year together a year apart and a year together
yeah
yeah
And now ?
Well I mean you know he 's back in Texas
he 's coming up once a month to visit
oh that 's been it
Well he was here from May until the end of August
mhm .
And then %um He went back down to teach you know
and this is supposed to be the last nine months we had to be apart
and then he was going to be up here the next year
and then I was either going to go down there
or we would hopefully have jobs in the same place to go to mhm because I 'm going to apply for jobs this year and next year you know for real tenure track teaching job
%huh fantastic
yeah
it 'll be wonderful if I get one
but I think it 's looking pretty good
I 'm actually in a good position to get one I think
yeah
%um So what really brought all this on this time is %um I mean you know the the on going problem you know
but %um mhm the only vacation we took this summer was to go visit his family
And I wrote you that letter that we were going there
No
Did you get you did n't get my letter
No
Is n't that strange ?
%huh
A long time ago or recently
I wrote it over the Summer
I wrote it in June or July
%hm I do n't know
%mm
With a picture
did you send a picture ?
No
No
just a letter
let him know
Because I was saying how we were coming in I wish that we could come to Budapest
and then I said call
write me and let me know when is a good time to call you
%huh
whenever I try to call I always get the machine
yeah
no
I do n't know
Anyway
Anyway
I 'm sorry
go ahead
no
that 's okay
%um it could just be the post
We have things lost
we have other peoples ' mail
I mean I do n't know
it 's not that bad
but occasionally some things have got lost
yeah
Right
anyway %um
So %eh it was kind of upsetting because I had hoped that we could do some other fun things together
we did n't take
Dave was like we do n't have the time
and we do n't have the money
mhm
and you know it turns out he just does n't want to spend any time alone with me
mhm
so he does n't want to because he says it makes him too anxious to go out with me
So I said okay
What am I going to do about this you know
like what can I do
how can I take a toss
okay what does he like to do
okay he likes to watch baseball on T V
And I hate it
for years I always just go in the bedroom and read when he does it in the summertime .
mhm
But I said okay I 'll watch baseball with him
So I sat there
and you know what I realized
Right
I did n't really put it together over the Summer
but he stopped watching baseball
oh
Every other Summer we 've been together every single night he spent watching baseball
mhm
And as soon as I sit down and do it with him he stops
%mm
mhm
Anyway so we did n't spend any time together
and then we went to England
and his parents were really mean to me
oh
And Dave just said well because we split up I need to earn my way back to the family
mhm
He said it 's understandable that they should be angry with me
because you took his son away from him
What did I do
I mean when I left with his son I do n't know it was you know with his understanding
mhm
it was supposedly an agreement we made together that he approved of
yeah
So why are his parents punishing me
%hm
They were really dreadful and very very cold
And you know I have just been so devoted and so loving
I mean I 'm taking this huge trip to go see them yeah as my only vacation
we spent all of our money to go do that you know
And they treat you like shit
And they treated me like shit
and it was very upsetting
thanks a lot al
and I do n't believe
And Dave did n't stand up for me .
You know what I mean .
mhm
And then afterwards everyone was very upset
and he did n't you know say oh they were wrong to treat you that way You know
nothing like that
What was his reasoning
Right
well what is it
I mean he says well they 're mad at you
and you know I mean he says it like you know because he 's English so he does n't spell it all out you know
yeah
But he says it and leaves it open for me to infer that he agrees with them
%mm
And then he does n't contradict it You know
and I say do you agree with them
and he does n't say anything you know
that kind of thing
yeah
yeah
%um So they 're coming for three weeks
I 'm supposed to spend My Christmas vacation in Texas with them
mhm
They 're coming for three weeks the only time that we both have free
mhm
and meanwhile it 's like he just ignores me when we 're around them
and I end up
three of the days we were there he and his brother and his father sat and watched cricket all day
and I had to like clean the house and do the cooking and watch Sam
I know
%mm
You know it 's incredible
And this is my only vacation
yeah
So I 'm supposed to spend my Christmas vacation which is the only time I 'm going to get to see him yeah with them
and I said I ca n't do it
and %um Then I told him that I really wanted him to come up for Christmas mhm So we can all be together for Christmas
and I just ca n't be with them every time
I mean I really struggled with it
I really tried to get psyched myself to do it
every time I thought about it I 'd just burst into tears
yeah
You know I love Christmas
and thing is that I loved these people
mhm
I really loved them
and the fact that they could turn on me like that showed me that they never really cared about me they obviously never approved of me
or why would they be treating me like this
No no
I think
They should be so happy that we 're back together right ?
yeah
but maybe at the time they took their son 's side
and you know they thought oh my gosh you know she took the child away
and she hurt I mean
Right .
Parents always take a boy 's side
they always take the you know
I know
I know
but it just really hurt that they could just turn on me like that
I mean I think that they should have seen that I 'm sure you know maybe this was nobody 's fault maybe it was both of our faults
and certainly they should be very happy for all of us that we 're together again and support us Absolutely Instead of Did you try talking to them punishing me
No
because I did n't really realize what was going on when we were there
I just knew I was feeling bad
yeah
And because they 're so indirect
mhm
They have this weird English oh no we 're nice and polite
yeah
yeah
yeah
but meanwhile cold like ice
yeah
exactly
yeah
exactly
So it was very hard to put it together
and Dave was the one
I thought that they were being very %um disapproving of Sam
but Dave was the one who told me no it was me
I mean most the stuff I 'm getting about them I 'm getting from him
oh
So I do n't even know like what
is he just trying to make me feel bad
you know what I mean
yeah
but I think that it 's true
I mean at some time he could be doing things to help keep me from feeling so bad You know
mhm
Like he does n't have to tell me all these things
I think he really wanted me to feel bad
he really wanted me to be punished mhm You know
and what did I do
I mean I was the one who got us back together
and I bent over backwards to make the relationship work
I 've done everything he said I was doing wrong that was keeping him from being happy
Well
nah it does n't work that way
%hm I know it does n't
but you know it 's like uch it 's just all a mess
and it 's disgusting
But anyway
so that 's been the most recent
So how do you feel about them
is it okay
now it 's okay
How are you handling all this stuff
you know I feel completely broken - hearted and devastated
yeah
well
I really do
I feel like I have put my life into this relationship
I spent seven years with him
I had a child with him
mhm .
You know I 've devoted myself to him .
and %um I do n't know
I had so much invested in this you know
yeah
yup
I just feel like I do n't know if I can ever really recover from it because it 's just been such a enormous colossal failure You know
Well then why force it
maybe it 's going to be better with somebody else
oh no
we 're not I mean
yeah
yeah
no no
because actually I know him Sara
I 've done nine and half years with Gabe
yeah
that 's right
and it really does feel like I have done nothing to change him
I know
You know I 've been trying to help him fix him
but I said to him you know what
you 're a typical Hungarian male
although they do look a li-
a little
What did Laura say ? Laura saw it
and her comments were that the commentators seem pretty high on the Skins
yeah
everyone did
actually she
although I have to say after the game last night %um beating Phoenix oh or Arizona whatever they 're called was certainly no great feat
I know %eh
but Miami
they are awful
%eh
They 're really bad
How 's Penn doing
it has n't started
oh it has n't started yet
oh I did n't realize that
nope
but I will keep you
how come Laura 's team started
I do n't think we played this week
yeah
the
No
I think you 're right
the Ivies start later
see we do n't play as many games
right
how did Laura 's do
Well
that figures
I have n't heard from her
bu-
Well write to her
she 'll like that
I try
it 's so hard mom
you do n't understand how little time I have to do anything these days
Yes I do
and it 's like impossible
I 've been waiting to find a half an hour when I could call because like it 's like I have to use the whole half hour
and there has n't been a time where I actually could just sit on the phone for a half hour
oh
oh We have to talk for a half an hour
you ca n't split it up ?
No
Not for free
oh
that 's weird
Well this is something very important
We got the Washingtonian
yeah
uh-huh
and they sa-
but did you get Playboy ?
Playboy ?
yeah
a girl in my class is in it .
What
I told you about that .
A girl in my med school class is in this month 's Playboy
oh
oh I did n't realize that
I thought it was a long time ago Playboy
No she did the posing over the Summer
yeah
oh I see
but it 's this month
%hm
Yes
it was very funny at the train station yesterday When Elliot went to go get his %um what you called Baron 's whatever
and I 'm like oh do they have Playboy here
let 's get it
yeah
%eh
and everybody is looking at me
Do you know her
What ?
Do you know her ?
yeah
I know her well
she 's a little bit weird
She 's beautiful
%hm
This is strange
does n't that seem like a strange thing to do
Yes
I think so
I think it 's
I mean what kind of a reception did it get ?
Mostly just like a gossipy I mean
you mean the actual picture
I mea-
i-
no no I meant what you 're saying
just gossip
just as you
yeah
just everybody talking about it
I think it 's a very peculiar way to launch your medical career
and I agree
anyway so what about Washingtonian
y-
very foolish girl
no it 's going to follow her
that 'll follow her forever
mhm
but what abo-
It really might not be bad
oh come on Bo-
It 's a good picture
yeah
but are going to want go to a doctor who has been a Playboy bunny ?
You 'd be surprised what people will go to
I did n't say I would
but you 'd be surprised what people will do
Well I w-
it 's publicity
maybe going to med school was a great way to launch her career as a Playboy model
that 's right
Is that what she said
no
anyway So what about Washington-
no well what was
alright Washingtonian is a lot more important
They said that Maid Brigade is a national franchise
So if you need a maid you can call Maid Brigade
and you could get
oh god
but I already cleaned up my apartment
yeah
but it 'll get dirty again
believe me
But I wrote you about how Elliot cleaned it up this weekend did n't I ?
But does he always want to do it ?
No
and he did n't clean it like Maid Brigade would
he just picked the papers up off the floor
I sort of had a feeling that might be the case
he actually cleaned up the kitchen a little bit . di- and made and got brunch
that was especially good
Did you get my message about Hong Kong
that you 'll try and that I should make su-
no
that
three days
How many days and all
yeah
I think I get there around noon
Lau-
and that 's one of the three days
that 's not in %uh
if you get there noon that means you wo n't get like to a hotel and everything until two three in the afternoon --
that 's days
yeah
-- so you have the evening
you have one evening
okay well I can do another day
the problem is that like cuts down my time in Singapore
yeah
tha-
oh oh well %hm
like I do n't have that much time
I had to leave on Sunday
do you have to make the decision when you go to Hong Kong now
I mean can you change the reservation with no cost later
I 've got until like the twentieth I think
no no no
I mean once you 've done it and you 're coming out here and you decide you want to leave a day early
I thought you know how those things are I could probably go standby
but the thing is the flights are really packed
they are ?
that 's the trouble
well the packed flights
I sure to Hong Kong might not be packed
right
granted
that 's
what I mean you could move that par-
except there 's the flights from there to Hong Kong
are the flights back to the States
and we 're talking like January first
Well that 's true
yeah
and so that 's when everybody goes back
But you 're not going to change that
You 're right
No no
not that
you 're missing the point
my point is a United flight from Singapore to Hong Kong yeah is one that goes Singapore Hong Kong U S
It 'll be crowded
yeah
%um U S
yeah
So those flights will still be tight
You would n't believe how much trouble I had getting reservations
oh
yeah
I would
I believe it
yeah
I figured %uh
actually We 're having trouble Now all the places are full because like I was wait listed to get to Japan
mhm
and then this woman Leigh Turbush that
mhm
You know our friend here
She 's trying to go to Hawaii this week
and she 's been trying for weeks
but she ca n't get on
well that 's %uh Japan
Hawaii is very crowded
mhm
yeah
Japanese are just %oof %uh really apparently travel
yeah
but I mean the time of year does n't matter
no
apparently it does n't matter
yeah
you should have heard
it was amazing
I called every airline as you know only I can do
right
and %uh it was with much hesitancy that I called Continental because I hate them so much
yeah
I was on hold for ten minutes while she figured out this route
I should 've known that if it took her ten minutes I should 've hung up
She had me go from like Philadelphia to New York to San Francisco to L A to Hawaii to Guam to Hong Kong to Tokyo to Singapo-
I mean she had me everywhere
I think they 're the only ones who go to
and she 'd for three thousand dollars
I was like are you joking
Uy
oh I have take fr-
in a couple weeks I have to Guam
and they 're the only ones that go there
the Continental ?
Continental
yeah
That 's funny
good luck
can you at least go business class
I do n't know if I can or not
yeah
oh by the way you were right with Singapore Air
it 's only business class or first class goes Right miles to frequent flyers
Right
yeah
%um Singapore Air takes you around through Europe
they do a route that way
yeah
yeah
that 's how they like to go
if I you know could have gone specially through Hong Kong
right
but that was a little bit more expensive
and they also have connections with Delta
yeah
they only give miles on Delta
but you can buy Delta seats on there
right
well actually they were going to send me on T W A
I almost thought it would be worth it to do that instead of the United because %uh fewer connections instead of connecting in %um
%eh well I mean it is a lot further to go through Japan and all that nonsense
but the problem with Singapore Air is I have to through New York through J F K . Uy which I now remember going from the domestic terminal to the international terminal
right
well T W A is not too bad
you have to walk a little bit
but
yeah
no
I mean it just yeah it 's not saving me much if I have to go through New York
but Tokyo is a bad place to layover
Tokyo is a ba-
and I have like an eight hour or five hour layover there
I know
yeah
usually
yeah
five hours
It 's crazy
It 's not that bad by the time you slept
it 's really
No
but it 's annoying that I have to go through Tokyo that I ca n't just fly from Hong Kong home
right
that is annoying
I 'm surprised you did n't go Hong Ko-
They do have route-
where does it go
Tokyo to where ?
San Francisco
yeah
is
or Hong Kong San Francisco
yes
but it 's full
United does have that
oh it 's full
I see
I mean at that price level I could pay more probably %mm which maybe I 'll look it
maybe I 'll find out how much more I have to pay
Can you get on a waiting list ?
Can you get on a waiting list
I 'll find out when I call back to confirm
Yes ,
it 's worth waiting l-
%eh with Hong Kong San Francisco San Francisco is much better
where 's Tokyo take you to
Tokyo to where
San Francisco
I do n't know if it 's the same old same old
oh oh no
yes
same thing
yeah
yeah
Well at least put yourself on the waiting list
can you do that ?
yeah
probably
but I have a feeling it 's like a price thing
Might not be
I do n't know
yeah
so yeah
I 've been there like five or six times Wow . because I drove across the country three times .
I 've been there wait , yes three times I think .
Well this is our second time .
yeah .
The first time we had been it was like twelve years ago
Kevin and I went on like a six week camping trip you know
you know from Idaho to Washington we hit all kinds of national parks and stu- .
uh-huh .
oh yeah
it 's so beautiful %huh .
And You know we spent you know couple days in Yellowstone and then you know a very little time in Grand Tetons
but we spent a lot of time in the national forests right around there because you know we were really camping and really serious --
uh-huh .
mhm .
And like we went into Jackson , the town
and we were like -- -- %ah let me out of here .
You know it was like a traffic jam and all these stores
and we sort of did n't know what was coming .
We were like oh my god traffic jams
uh-huh .
What kind of tourist hell is this ?
Get us out of here .
of course then we were like you know let 's stay here a couple days .
And now you guys have a five year old
and
yeah .
This is kind of cute .
oh look
there 's the Benneton outlet .
oh you guys have really turned into yuppies , %huh ?
Scary .
What we should n't have a house in the suburbs .
Well if I 'm unemployed I ca n't be a yuppie can I ?
Do n't I need to be professional ?
%um . yeah
I guess .
Well Norm and I are worse because we live in the suburbs .
%uh so .
Well really silly
we 'll save that for our self respects .
So are you coming or not ?
Are you coming or not ?
Are you coming or not ?
I do n't know .
It 's up to my husband .
Hopefully he 'll finish soon %uh -- -- and %um
I thought you said he was finished .
You know I mean
yeah
he is finished .
I thought you said he did send it today .
He is finished .
He just has to defend .
So I do n't know .
We 'll see what happens .
I 'll talk to him today .
He has a job
so .
If not when are you guys moving ?
We 're not moving for a year .
oh okay .
Good .
We wo n't move till okay . %mm probably June .
okay .
Maybe early June .
Because if I do n't come when Norm does his defense uh-huh , uh-huh . which I really want to come for that
but you know I might not be able to for other reasons .
uh-huh .
But if I ca n't come then then I 'm going to stop in January .
Well I 'll probably stop in January anyhow . Excellent Because I 'm going to %uh in January with the baby to %uh -- -- see %uh -- -- the
it 'll come out to see the relatives .
Show off le bebe .
yeah .
Show off le bebe .
Excellent
Do you think ei-
I mean eight weeks is not really
well it 'll be older than eight weeks
it 'll be like ten weeks by then .
That 's not too early to travel is it ?
Nope .
I thought it would be like much easier to travel if we went when he was ten weeks than -- yep , yep , yep . -- you know after that .
when they 're new infants it 's like bring along a blanket so you can nurse them .
And like you could do anything .
You could probably go like do skydiving or something .
yeah .
I know .
And if you were nursing the baby while you were skydiving the baby would be like okay .
yeah .
Alright .
As long as we 're nursing while we 're doing this that 's okay .
That 's what I thought too .
And they do n't need that many clothes when they 're that young .
And they do n't need toys .
So .
You know basically you do n't need to bring anything . %uh but you know your two boobs .
%uh And since I ca n't really go anywhere without those anyhow
They 're hard to forget
yeah .
Hard to leave behind .
yeah .
So I mean you know then we can just use disposables if we 're travelling ,
so
oh definitely .
Do n't
we did
one time like we were travelling in the car
we were like oh we can just bring a little mini diaper pail and all .
yeah .
That was after one time
I went never again .
Disposables for travelling .
And %um Absolutely . Every now did you supplement nursing with bottles at all or did n't you ?
No .
No .
Somehow like I read too many of the books
so I thought it was like no formula .
It does make a difference
like I always thought formula smells kind of disgusting
oh yeah .
Like when they throw up it smells disgusting
and when they make their little doo - doo's it smells grosser if they 're on formula .
now you 'll find this hard this believe but if they 're totally breast milk for like the first couple months -- mhm . their number twos do n't smell at all .
oh okay .
They do n't smell like anything .
It 's like it looks like shit but it does n't smell like anything .
oh okay .
And did you pump or not ?
yeah I pumped .
What joy that was .
Did you use a manual or %uh did you get one of those little battery ones ?
Battery operated deal .
yeah .
I think so too .
Now like I can tell you
I can find the exact brand name of it if you want some time .
But like it had like this little like nozzle attachment thing on it which was what it said you were supposed to use .
mhm .
mhm .
And I used it the first time for like three seconds
I was like -- -- %ah get this thing off me .
That really hurt .
Do n't ever do that again .
And I forget what it said it was for
I think it said it was for if you had small breasts or something .
I do n't know what
oh okay .
so like I took that thing
and I threw it away .
It was like a little part you put on top of a nozzle thing .
It was just like an extra attachment
and I took that
and I -- mhm okay . -- threw it away
okay .
And then it was fine .
okay .
So .
yeah .
That seemed to work fine
ye-
You know if you could avoid it you know if it was a choice in your life to say well for the first couple months I 'll just be home
and I 'll just get a lot of rest
and I 'll take it easy
and if I 'm not -- -- sleeping at night I 'll just sleep during the day or sleep when the baby sleeps .
yeah .
Not do this whole pumping thing
I mean if I had to do it all over that 's what I would do .
oh yeah
because I was thinking it would be easier because then other people could feed the baby and you would n't have to be so tied to it .
yeah .
And if you want to go out to a movie or something .
Mean that you know did you
Well we never go out .
I mean you know what Norm and I are like
I mean .
Well believe me
when you have a baby you 'll want , to put it in someone else 's house or someone come watch it in your house and go anywhere else .
See that 's what I was thinking like for my in laws and stuff when we go home for Christmas .
mhm .
It would be so nice to just you know leave the baby with them
but you ca n't leave the baby .
yeah .
I mean you know you might have to try one or two before you find one that works
but yeah . once
and you know they have like things and like can set the tension or whatever
they get suck power .
the tension
they 're like the little knob on your sewing machine .
You can set the power level and stuff
and it g-
Or like extra suck for just starting to suck .
You know it 's like once you get used it i-
you know at first you feel like what am I doing putting this machine on me
it 's disgusting or obscene or something .
But once you get used to it %uh you know you can like read while you 're doing it .
It was like boring .
uh-huh .
okay .
And what does it go into
like a little plastic bag **thingy** ?
%uh well the thing I had was -- -- like you screwed on this whole motor suction part -- uh-huh . -- on to something that was just like a jar bottom .
You know just looked like a screw thing so that it went to this plastic container .
okay .
And you can reuse the plastic container ?
And then what I would do is just %uh I would bring little bags like that you 're supposed to put formula in with me to work .
oh okay .
And then I 'd pour it from the container into the plastic bag and seal it up and then go you know rinse out the container thing and wash it the next day .
And did you throw away the plastic bags when you were done ?
Well see then the plastic bag is designed to go inside a bottle thing .
yeah .
so you throw the plastic bag away when you 're done .
After your baby drinks the milk yeah .
yeah
okay
okay .
I 'm just trying to you know
we have a f- %um %uh %uh
And that way you can freeze them
so you know we 'd end up
yeah .
there was sort of like a go or no go for breast pumping
like once you just kind of got everything going it was like it ended up I was pumping too much you know
it was like %mm okay . we ended up with a freezer full
like we found a year later a freezer full of breast milk .
God .
oh let 's just throw this all away .
It 's like all that hard work
but you know it was either explode or you know pretty much
But I thought like you totally got down to the level so even if you only breast fed you know once a day that that 's how much milk you would have .
I do n't know .
All I can tell you is to get a big bag .
okay
It 's like once I started at work I you know
once he was getting bigger or something there was
like I was making two bags
and it was like if you sat down you either did two bags or you 'd explode
that was it .
And she just could n't quite drink that much
so
%mm okay .
You know that was why I was working in the morning
the morning 's when you do the most .
Everybody 's different
so it probably
yeah
yeah
that 's true .
Well I only have fourteen weeks left
so .
Wow you 're getting there .
I know
I know .
Stopping with the miscarriage anxiety starting with the delivery anxiety .
I know
oh no .
I had the miscarriage anxiety up until the
you know because you have all those well wishers you know telling you about all those things you know .
ooh everybody wants to start telling you these things
like people would like corner me to tell me about their hysterectomies .
It 's like somehow some O B gyn connection that they see you and they think of O B gyn and they 've got to tell you about it .
oh my god .
you know
yeah
Well I 've heard the cord accident stories which had me like totally and completely freaked out .
are you still there ?
yeah
I 'm still here
oh
so I talked to my doctor about it
and apparently it 's very rare
so do n't ask me why I 've heard so many stories about it
but
oh yeah
and then there was this friend I had
she was eight and a half months pregnant
and you know baby had a cord accident
and she died .
Like most people they just have babies
it all works out .
yeah .
I know .
I know
so I 'm not so freaked out anymore .
Good .
That was like
I was talking to Erica on the phone
and %uh that 's what she told me
she 's like but d-
to say that it was okay she was like saying that well you know but this woman is pregnant again and you know will have her baby again soon
so it was like no big deal .
No
yeah .
But having never been pregnant before , you know I 'm sure Erica has like no idea
this woman must be on just you know absolute . pins and needles .
She must be having the most miserable pregnancy in the whole world .
yeah
that 's such a public thing .
Like everyone knew she was pregnant .
I mean once you 're eight and half months , man , I mean there was nothing nice about it
I know .
you know if you 've made it through the eight and a half months , man , you deserve a baby .
I bet
I know
you know and then to have to go back to work and you know
and then the second pregnancy must be just like fraught with anxiety and especially since it happened at eight and a half months , you know .
yeah
and everybody is probably saying now you better really drink milk this time .
You better eat your cottage cheese now .
I Know .
I know
I know
yeah .
I actually did start drinking more milk
and it has helped with all my little aches and pains and stuff .
Well , How do you feel about that ?
Well , that 's okay
That was weird
yeah ,
I thought I had to start right away ,
my God , I have another half an hour .
You better have a lot to tell me .
I do n't know .
I do n't know
I do n't have a lot to tell you because my life is much the same here ,
just lots of company .
Lots of kids .
But it was fun .
It was fun to have them , you know like do things with them that I do n't ordinarily do
And now %um Mindy is coming with her family on Monday
so we decided we 'd take about five days off .
They 'll be here for two weeks
so we 'll be here for the second week with them .
And that will be good .
%uh
yeah .
Anyhow , she 's so busy
did you get her invitation for the
I did
and I sent back %uh my oh good . R S V P just for one of us though because yeah . that 's the same day that %um
you know the thing that %uh we usually go to in Boca Raton ?
yeah
down in Florida
yeah
yeah ,
well this year they switched it from Where is it ? November October or from December whenever it was yeah right to that
it starts that day .
oh phoo .
So ,
Now where is it taking place now ?
In Boca Raton again .
oh again . %ah
So I think what I 'm going to do is %um ,
well we 'll both probably
the way it works I 'll just leave the same time except I will head for yeah yeah oh great . there and he 'll head for Florida
great .
oh great .
Well I 'm going to take %uh a room in the hotel too over the weekend
I think I 'll probably go in earlier in the week
And %uh
but I thought I 'd also stay at the hotel because there will be so many people there that I 'd like to see .
%ah
So I
if you %uh saw that response card it said something about calling the Hilton
and Mindy had a rate yeah . for the family which was seventy - nine dollars
so if it 's anything other than that insist that you 're with the Landau party .
oh . okay .
Because Huck 's sister had called and they had told her ninety - nine dollars
and when I spoke to Mindy she said she had just rechecked with them this week
so there was some misunderstanding there
%huh !
but nevertheless . We 're looking forward to it .
It 's the first family get - together we 've had in a long time .
I know
that 's why I yeah do n't want to miss it .
I
yeah
and so it should be fun .
I do n't know %uh .
hey you know I wrote my dad and asked him if he was going or
oh I should hope so .
Gosh .
I hope so too .
is n't that far for them .
No .
It 's
No .
%eh .
Have you seen them at all lately ?
No I have n't
I have n't been back
I 'm going to be in Philadelphia in September oh . with %um a book
uh-huh .
and actually I 'll be in Boston too for
oh .
which book is it now ?
It 's the next mystery
the mystery
oh
yeah .
well then good
It seems to be what I can sell at the moment
so
Well that 's great .
Are they selling well ?
I think they 're doing okay
and this time they 're Good . sending me around
and %um yeah so I 'll be in Philadelphia then
and then I thought if it turns out that oh it 's too crowded you know that sometimes they send you in and there 's no real block of time oh yeah . %um then after the bat mitzvah
but anyway yeah yeah . %um Bob will still be in Florida for a couple
so I think I 'll go up yeah . like to Philadelphia again
oh good
yeah
yeah
oh well that would be nice
and then I can really visit
there 's a lot of people I 'd love to see
oh I know . I have n't seen Pearl .
How is Pearl doing ?
oh I just talked to her .
She had another setback about two weeks ago
she had a small stroke
oh my God
but she was in the hospital with that for a week
but I just talked to her
her left arm and she happens to be lefthanded %uh was hit
and %um she said she 's getting it back .
She 's almost able to write again .
In fact she 's been trying to .
%uh
But yesterday was really her first day that she was out
and %ah she 's so fantastic .
Every time I call her she just you know always sounds so up .
Of course I talked to Jackie too
and Jackie always sounds so down
yeah ,
I think j-
she 's so
oh it 's really hitting Jackie so hard .
She 's just very upset about it .
But oh I just hope to God she gets over the cancer part .
That 's the worst part
and I have
I think that the other lung is affected too
but sh-
yeah .
oh God
not going to do chemotherapy again .
She just does n't want to
%uh
I had been down to Atlantic City
oh I think it was my fiftieth high school reunion early June
and I stayed with them that weekend
and we had such a good time .
She was great
and that Sunday night while we were there she had that small heart attack .
Did you know about that ?
No .
yeah ,
%eh she had a heart attack that night
%uh
She was having a great deal of pressure and pain
and you know we thought maybe it 's indigestion or this or that
and she oh did n't want to go to the hospital there
so they went straight on home
and it was hard for them
she was in a lot of pain
but she did have a heart attack
oh well that 's of course related to the stroke that she just had .
oh
%uh
yeah
I tell you
it 's just been one thing after another
and as soon she has gotten over one she 's just hit with something else
but when you talk to her she 's just wonderful you know
she just really tries to keep her spirits up and tries to help everybody else .
her kids have been great
and Jackie has been great
poor
Jackie did get to Atlantic City for a month .
She had rented a place there .
oh
yeah
so she had a good month
that 's good
It was n't until the end that %uh Pearl was n't feeling so well again .
oh
But it 's stinky !
It is .
It is just
I know .
We 've had a very stinky %um
We 're fine
yeah
but we 've had so many friends actually
I think that 's part of what has occupied me since really really April I think whatever the day of the second Real- Seder
yeah
You probably even remember him .
Remember our friend Dick Bryner .
He 's a judge
he has white hair
he 's just absolutely charming guy
mhm mhm
I 'm not sure that I do remember
oh
and %uh he was part of the biking group
uh-huh
and I think he had a bad bike accident %um
really
but they do n't know if it was a bad bike accident or a major stroke that uh-huh created a bi-
but he nearly died
we spent a lot of time there
he was
oh
you know if
right after the accident ?
yeah
then I mean the accident nearly killed him
oh God
and he 's still in a rehabilitation oh really hospital did n't die
but he 's paralysed on one side
and he 's oh God half blind
and he
oh what a shame
is he about Bob 's age ?
and so that
yeah
and it
I mean
really a very good friend
and it 's been horrible
yeah
really
oh
and his mind seems I mean to be back almost which is oh yeah yeah wonderful
but that was awful
and then I have %uh %huh another friend %uh who was also at the party %mm who just %um got %uh a cancer that is so rare %huh she 's the only case in Marin that they have of %uh
it 's vaginal cancer
oh
and it 's inoperable
and so
%huh
what a shame
I took her for some radiation and took her some food
and then we 've had several friends die
I had a friend oh God you 're too young whose child was killed
Your age group is too young for all that .
%ah . It has been horrific .
One of my friends in Philadel-
one of the reasons I feel like I have to go back uh-huh in October is %um one of my friend 's sons was killed in an automobile accident %um
gee
This has all been in like three or four months
and That 's too bad . it feels too soon except maybe this is just %um
but I was thinking about it because I even thought I wanted to write about it because I thought there 's no word for
yeah
oh
you know when people say how are you ?
yeah yeah
and it really
everything has been fine for us
yeah thank God ,
yeah .
but I 've been so depre-
I mean it just feels like all these people I love are oh I know I know . I know in terrible shape
and %uh
%uh sorry to hear that
but then you just have to count your blessings and make every day count .
Yes
that 's all I 've ever
one never knows
yeah
No
That 's the sen-
So for us we are having oh good wonder-
first of all Jonathan who has waited eight months uh-huh to hear about a job and was
yes
he 's just Thursday found out he has the job
so oh that 's good both of my sons are employed which is
oh that 's good
oh well Matt
Is Matt through school ?
No ,
actually he 's on a summer internship with Deloitte Touche
and he is %um
oh .
oh .
Is he back in California ?
yeah he 's supposedly
actually he 's in the house right now
but uh-huh He 's supposedly living here for the summer
but uh-huh . the work he 's doing is outside of Sacramento somewhere
oh
so he 's really there all week
yeah
oh that 's nice to have him around again
yeah
and then he blitzes out every so often
he 's been
they 're paying him too much oh for the summer
oh
and so he went to New York for a party last week-
oh
L A for something .
Next he 's going to Mexico at the end of
oh wow
oh wow
and we 're hoping they 'll offer him a job .
he will know th-
oh .
Well
but he has to go back though another year does- ?
yeah
yeah
but these internships are really an attempt to
yeah .
What is he doing ?
Management consulting in %um th-
Wow .
And what 's the name of the company ?
Deloitte Touche
it 's one of the big accounting firms except most of them have Deloitte Touche Wow developed these separate wings of management consultants to go out and
%uh this is a retooling kind of of uh-huh Blue Shield of California that wants to go from twelve offices to three
something like that .
oh
oh
So they work on the logistic uh-huh . and how you do it .
So , he 's having a really good time
oh yeah .
oh , it sounds that way .
and it 's fun to see him now and then .
yeah ,
is he enjoying the work that he 's doing ?
yeah ,
at first it completely intimidated him because oh . they really are asking him to research a rather major part of it
and he thought oh my g-
he said it felt like oh . being suddenly told you 're in the Olympics and here 's the torch and get it
oh
but after a couple of weeks he said he thought he understood what he was doing .
That 's good .
and he 's done wonderfully in school .
How are you ?
I 'm doing great man ,
it took ten years
and I 've been going nonstop since November
man it 's been unbelievable .
With your band or what ?
: Well %uh , with my band
it started in November with workshops
all of a sudden the music schools found out that I had something to offer my music and rehearsing them .
So I 've been doing these three day workshops Wow . where you do a concert on the third night
and %uh I did it in Saarbruecken , Mannheim , Cologne ,
Jigs brought me up there twi-
actually I had to go back twice .
Great .
And Nuremburg
and then of course I have my regular Borghausen thing you know over there where they have the jazz festival yeah ? on the Austrian border
it 's about a hundred K's from here .
yeah ,
you 've been doing that one a while .
yeah ,
several years
although it finished last month ,
they ran out of money .
well
They were paying me real good you know ,
five hundred marks a shot just to rehearse gigs .
Are you playing much then
or are you just basic-
Well yeah
I 'm playing ,
sure .
so your chops are up ?
Well no they 're not up
but I 'm playing
it 's very hard to get my chops back in form
but I 'm going to try ,
I 'll tell you what 's happening
%uh first of all you knew that we had Conti here last year .
yeah
but I have n't talked to hi-
yes
I did talk to Count ,
yeah ,
mhm .
What did he say ?
114.86_118.28_A: well he had said he had a good time
but he said you did n't play much .
Well no ,
because %uh my chops were down .
My chops were down
so I just conducted the band .
He has the video of the night we played here
and whenever you can get together with him sometime -- oh really ? -- have him sh-
yeah
well I 'll get that .
%huh
Did you know he just had a bypass ?
yeah .
okay
Mupo called me
I could n't believe it
and then I called Count in the hospital ,
he said he was all right and was going to be playing
and in fact he 's supposed to be here in %uh Berlin the beginning of next month .
yeah
well he 's doing fine ,
I have n't talked to him
but I 've heard roundabout that he was yeah what a st- in town working last week or something
%uh Katzman was just here .
And then i-
who ?
Katzman .
oh yeah
what 's with him ?
oh
oh well
well we played some tennis
but he 's the same as he always has been you know .
Where 's he living these days ?
%ah out on the island ,
Manhasset I think .
%eh I ca n't keep track of him .
yeah .
But he 's fine
So how did you like Japan ?
Well I had a good time Al ,
shit .
Had you been there before ?
yeah
I was there in nineteen ninety uh-huh . %uh with Percy Faith ,
but we did n't have very much to play ,
we did n't have that much more to play with Billy Vaughan
but we had
I ca n't believe that Billy Vaughan is still going ,
I mean Ray and those cats were going over thirty years ago .
yeah
I know it ,
well Billy Vaughan passed away three years ago
%uh but this guy is big over there ,
I mean we had unbelievable crowds .
Well yeah
the Japanese they turn out .
No
I loved it over there
I went over with Zad and Mel of course in seventy - five
yeah .
And then %uh %uh when the hell was it three or four years ago I went over with a Glenn Miller band from Holland .
%mm oh , was that the one with Zeke ?
With who ?
Zeke ?
yeah
Zeke was on it .
Have you talked to him about it ?
Well yeah ,
well we talked about it on the road because he was on the trip that I did you know
yeah
he makes all those trips .
yeah
he was funny .
Amazing at his age At his age . still blowing and still drinking .
does he drink
yeah
He 's amazing .
But he played good ,
I was glad he was there because I had these young cats all good jazz players but no band experience .
uh-huh .
I had to rehearse them every day of the tour
I have a tape of the last concert in Tokyo
and it was pretty good .
And there my chops were up
I played Jubilee with the high G on the end
and Wow . I sang Chattanooga Choo Choo and Serenade &in Blue and Fiesta &in Blue
and %uh %eh that 's where I %ah met this girl singer from Holland
she impressed me so much that I got her on my band about three years ago .
oh what 's her name ?
%eh Lydia Van Damme .
mhm
Anyhow she 's not with me anymore because I discovered another great singer here
she 's been with me since February .
%uh let me back up now .
okay .
So I 've been doing all these workshops since November ,
and I 've been doing the Borghausen thing
and then in February finally there 's a beautiful club here
but it 's a weird scene
%uh I say weird for us .
It 's this beautiful club
but they go from like eleven till five in the morning
and there 's no %eh admission .
It 's the young jet set , you know young people with money
they stay up all night ,
and he has live music every night .
Anyhow , I 've been talking about trying to get a Monday night around here for years you know something like the Vanguard
yeah
with your band
%eh yeah
and it finally happened
so we started in February .
Every two weeks on a Monday
and it 's been a huge success .
Great
Of course we did everything first class
new music stands new music stand lights a big curtain in the back with our big logo there and %uh so forth and so on
and this new girl singer
and she plays trumpet
No .
I 've known her for years as a trumpet player
she went to all the music schools here .
%huh . She 's a German chick
And sh-
%huh ?
yeah
Germ-
and she sings great .
I got to send you a tape man
so it 's been a huge success
and then of course in May to celebrate my birthday we brought in Charlie Mariano
uh-huh .
And I have a video of that .
We also got a mitchnit that night from Bayerischer Rundfunk
so it was a great night .
My seventieth birthday
and %uh we finished about a month ago
and I 'm taking a little break now although I 'm still busy
I 'm doing another %uh workshop soon
and I 'm getting all this music together
and %uh we did a job about a week ago in Augsburg
it was part of a jazz festival there
and that went very well
five hundred people there .
mhm .
Anyhow we start our new %uh season October ninth
and we 're going to have a guest soloist every two weeks for the remaining six Mondays in this year .
In January we 're actually planning on going every Monday
%eh oh I did n't tell you our hours .
the no-
Well yeah
you did eleven to five
Well that 's the normal hours when they bring in these rock groups and weird groups
%eh the people do n't care what it is .
It 's so damn loud in there it do n't make any difference
it 's just live mu-
We play from eight thirty to eleven on Mondays .
yeah
oh great .
So it 's a different crowd %eh older crowd
and then some young people too
and we 're actually building our own following
and it 's great
and %eh Annetta the singer is breaking it up
and I 'm playing back in the section again although my chops are not up to play lead like I did before
mhm
but I 'm going to %uh start section rehearsals next month and hope to get back in shape by October .
Do you still have your original rhythm section
or are they too busy now ?
Well %eh
The ones you recorded with Al Cone and all of that .
No ,
well that was eighty - seven
yeah .
No ,
but I have great replacements
I got lucky you know
up until I got that drummer and the piano player especially from Karlsruhe if I did n't have them I would be out of business because there was nobody else around .
Now there 's a lot of good young players popping up in fact now with my band on these Mondays because like my trumpet players my two lead players they 're busy all the times .
So I 've had to get subs
and before it was always a problem .
Now there 's these good young players I mean good from Stuttgart Nuremberg
where are they coming from ?
and they 're willing to come here to
Where are they coming from
through Jig 's school or something ?
All the different schools
yeah
in fact about %uh three weeks ago Brookmeyer was here for two weeks .
He went on tour with an allstar band of these young new upcoming players
%hm
%hm
They 're the best of the new crop .
These two new trumpet pliers I 've been using them as subs
and %uh they 're willing to come from Stuttgart and Nuremberg anywhere to play with me .
wow great .
Whereas my cats you know I got to kiss asses
still they 're busy and this and that
so yeah yeah I 've gotten lucky there .
So we 're going to open with a guy named Burt Yores trumpet player from Belgium very good player and arranger
I bought one of his arrangements
it 's a beautiful arrangement
%uh and %uh different soloists
Ray Peezie 's coming two weeks after tha-
yeah
I worked with Ray the other night
and he said he was going to that
yeah
You did
did he say anything about coming here ?
yeah
we talked about it .
What did he say ?
%mm well he sent you a letter too
yeah
he 's looking forward to it
he 's got eighteen days total .
Well I am
%huh ?
He 's only got eighteen days total
but %uh
yeah ,
does he play mostly soprano or what ?
He plays everything .
He plays alto and %eh
Well yeah
because see every time I have a soloist like Conti and with Charlie Mariano I figure out which arrangements they 're going to play on
and I write out all their chords and where to come in and everything --
mhm .
-- and I send them a cassette so that when they get here you know
with Conti we did n't even have time for one rehearsal not even
mhm
With Charlie we did
so this helps a lot .
you want me to ask Ray what he 's going to be playing ?
%uh well %uh did you say he wrote me a letter ?
yeah .
Because I 'm getting %uh ready to contact him
I 've been so damn busy man
and right now I 'm %uh working on music now
yeah
if you happen to see him ask him if he prefers soprano or alto or okay because I have to know what key to write the solos in
yeah okay
I 'll ask him nex-
because we 're working together on Sunday
so .
That 's a coincidence anyhow
tell him I 'm going to contact him soon .
okay .
And I 'll be sending him of course %uh soon I do n't want to leave it to the last minute the titles he 'll play on the cassette and the chords for all the solos
Wow .
So %uh October ninth we have Burt Yores
October twenty - third I think that 's two weeks later we have Ray Peezie on %uh November third Roman Schvala
mhm .
Remember that name ?
Sure .
Very good tenor man .
yeah .
And then on %eh the following %uh the guy here that had his own club %uh Jerry Hayes
and on %uh December fourth I think it is Herb Geller .
Really .
Right
Herb is blowing great you know
he retired from the radio finally
yeah
I knew that
I knew that
He went to L A and made a recording there
all Al Cone tunes
he 's been quite busy and yeah . playing great
He 's actually going to play with us in Murenau some town near here on November thirtieth
and then on the following Monday he 'll play with us
and our last one December %uh eighteenth or something John Marshall is coming down .
okay .
I do n't think you gave me an address , though .
I might not have had one then .
Right .
I did n't get it right at first .
So
So , when did you get there ?
I started work August first
so what 's today ,
the twentieth or something ?
uh-huh .
The twentieth
yeah .
yeah
%um and I arrived in Detroit just the night before I started work
so I had been here just three weeks .
It will be three weeks Tuesday That I started work
and %um so I worked in the office for a week in a half
and then we had our orientation for the new volunteers
uh-huh .
And that was out in western Michigan on Lake Michigan about four hours from here
so we went up there and spent almost a week %um
sounds nice
Did you take your car
did you drive there ?
I drove up here ,
yeah .
From Omaha ?
yup .
Wow .
It took a couple days .
I mean , it would have been maybe fourteen or fifteen hours .
I did n't want to do it all in one day
so I broke it up and stopped in Wisconsin at a friend 's house
Right
so anyway we have fifty - six new volunteers that are oriented and off .
They left for their new homes on Thursday
and we came back to Detroit
so
uh-huh .
How many of you are there ?
On staff ?
Right .
There 's five of us on staff .
The director -- uh-huh . -- three area directors , and then
I do n't know what Kate
Kate is the woman I 'm living with .
I 'm not sure what her position is called
it 's kind of like development
And helps the director with fundraising .
I 'm not sure .
What special
And the director 's in Detroit .
yeah ,
we 're all in Detroit
but the area directors %um travel to the cities that the volunteers are in and %um you know meet with the communities and stuff like that .
So
What 's your area then ?
I go to Kansas City , Saint Louis , Des Moines ,
and then I also have the community here in Detroit .
oh that 's cool .
So
yeah
I me-
Old stomping ground
I know .
It 's so cool
Do you have to go so many times during the year
or
I go once in the fall for a week to each city and then once in the spring
so well late winter I guess %um
So when I go in October I go first to Kansas City then to Saint Louis
then I come back to Detroit
and we have our %um
our fall retreat is in Dubuque , Iowa
so that 's in the middle of my area visits
and then I do my Detroit area visit ,
then I go to Des Moines
but the way it works out for Kansas City and Saint Louis I go to Kansas City and at the end of the week it 's my birthday
mhm .
So I spend the morning of my birthday with Elisa
and then I fly to Saint Louis and spend you know the afternoon with Chris or Lou or whoever I hook up with in Saint Louis
so mhm . I 'm like wow that worked out perfectly .
That 's cool .
yeah ,
so .
So it sounds like you 're going to be gone a lot ?
yeah ,
from October sixth through Thanksgiving I 'm here like I do n't know ten days or something nutty like that %um
and then
oh really .
Are you going to go home for Thanksgiving ?
I do n't know yet %um
I 'm going home in September for just a three day weekend or something like that %um because September is pretty much one of the slowest months on the job
so
mhm
And I have n't been to Texas in a while
so I thought that would work out
and %um then at Christmas time I think well one of my cousins %um is getting married near Kansas City
and I 'm hoping my family will just come up to Kansas for that
%mm .
mhm
And then I 'll go there and see them
so I do n't know about Thanksgiving yet .
That 's too far away to figure out
so anyway I will be .
Gosh , are you happy ?
yeah ,
I am
it was really hard to make the decision
I actually at one point decided no I 'm not going to go
just like I do n't think I want to start all over again
and -- mhm . I 'm liking being in Omaha and all that sort of thing
and so I called and told the director you know I thought about it a lot blah blah blah
but I %eh just do n't think it 's right for me right now
and mhm He was like
I do n't know him very well
but %uh he had strep throat when I was here
I mean he just was n't feeling well
I mean was like well .
mhm .
okay
and %uh later that morning Kate called me at work in Omaha .
And I 'm like Kate are calling to make this really hard on me
an- ?
%eh
She 's like we just want you to think about one more thing
and %eh the job is supposed to be a two year commitment
uh-huh .
and that was kind of like one of the things that I 'm thinking I do n't know about doing a two year commitment %eh you know all this sort of thing
That was too long
or it was too short .
well -- no ,
I mean it could be longer
so it 's not like it was too short .
It was just . you know
I do n't know .
I do n't know what I was thinking
but anyway so they 're like what if it was just a one year commitment
and I said well I 'll think about it
kind of threw me off
and then I called later
and I asked the director if %um
I said well would you be willing to
a first year %um area director makes seventeen thousand
and a second year area director makes eighteen thousand five hundred .
First year you get three weeks vacation .
Second year you get four weeks
and I said well would you be willing to hire me as if I was coming in at a second year mhm . %um %eh at eighteen five with four weeks of vacation
and he said yeah he would be willing to do that .
Wow that 's a lot of vacation .
yeah
it is which is wonderful
That 's great .
%mm . And that 's more important to me than money
so
Right
yeah
and we get the whole week from Christmas to New Year
that 's one of our weeks of vacation
so it 's only mhm . you know in addition to that
So anyway ,
And the rest you can take pretty much %eh when you want
I mean you work it around your schedule .
Right .
yeah ,
you got to work it around your schedule which is
in you know summer is not a really good time to take it because you 're ending one year and starting the next year and you know doing a lot with the volunteers coming in
mhm .
-- so I 'll probably try to take most of it before next summer ,
we 'll see .
mhm .
%um so I thought about it that day
and I ended up calling back and saying okay I 'm coming to Detroit
so It 's been really good since I 've
I mean actually I made the decision
and I thought oh God what am I doing you know
I just was still unsure about it
but in a couple days I just felt really at peace with it and remained so throughout the time that I prepared to leave
and then ever since I 've been here I keep thinking okay why am I so okay with this
I 'm going to be falling apart any minute , right you know ?
Because I 'm really used to transition hitting me a little bit harder especially when I was so ambivalent about the decision
but Right . %um I do n't know .
It 's been great
That 's great .
So
yeah .
Great .
Do n't question it ?
Go with it
yeah
exac-
that 's what I said finally %um
I was telling somebody
somebody is like well how you doing ?
I said well I 'm fine you know
I keep wondering how long that 's going to last .
I 'm fine
what 's wrong with me
and then finally I 'm like you know I am just going to be okay that I 'm okay
and if I 'm not okay later that 's fine
but right now I 'm okay
I have to stop wondering when it 's going to end
So that 's kind of where I 've been .
%hm %hm So tell me about New York
I got your postcard .
oh , New York was really fun
%um I loved the city .
It was
yeah .
I do n't know
I did n't expect to enjoy the city so much .
You had been there before though had n't you
no ?
Just really briefly .
I went to Long Island for a friend 's wedding
and Katie and I , my housemate from Oregon went together
uh-huh .
and we took a train into the city , a cab to the Metropolitan Museum &of Art ran around there for an hour and half , took a cab back , and then the train back to Long Island
so I mean that was it .
That 's all we saw .
oh that was it .
%um and I liked that
but it did n't even feel like I had actually been in the city you know .
mhm .
%um so this was more like
you know we did a lot of the **touristy** stuff and walked on the Brooklyn Bridge and mhm . took the ferry and %um walked in Central Park and went to a show and all that sort of stuff
so it was really fun %um
Sounds great
and we also went out to Long Island where Joe 's mom lives -- uh-huh . and spent time with the whole family So -- which was okay .
It was good .
. At first when we were planning the trip he 's like oh I hope we can go out and you know go to the beach and you can meet my brother and my nieces and nephe-
he 's got three brothers
%um two of them live on Long Island .
You want to meet my brothers and my nieces and nephews
and I 'm like %um I do n't know Joe
I do n't
I said I think maybe we need the time just to kind of figure out where our relationship is before
mhm .
I said it 's not that I do n't want to meet your family
it 's just
I do n't know
-- That 's a lot at once . I know his mom too
and I think she 's a little bit leery of this whole relationship based on what happened in the past you know
mhm .
and I hurt her son and all that sort of thing .
I 'm like I just do n't know if I 'm ready for that
but it ended up happening that it was his brother 's birthday
and we were out there to go to the beach
and so I 'm like okay you know I can handle this
and %uh it was very nice actually
so Good . that was fine
and %uh
So where did things end up ?
oh I do n't know , Vick ,
%um it was really fun
and I mean in some ways Joe is somebody I 've known a long time and and know pretty well
but in other ways it 's like this is a whole new relationship
mhm .
so it 's kind of weird to walk that balance like well you know , one minute we 're talking seriously like where would we live if we wanted to be together and the next you know I 'm like Wow . wait a minute
I ca n't believe we 're talking about this
I mean
What 's he doing now ?
He 's in his last year of graduate school at Columbia University .
He 's getting his Masters in Public Administration .
uh-huh .
And he 's been working with this man who 's starting a new nonprofit organization
%um
he worked with him last summer and this summer and probably will work with during the school year .
Beyond that he does n't know what he 's going to do you know
but you know it 's kind of hard because -- Kind of open but I mean chances are really good that he 'll want to stay in New York or at least on the east coast , you know ?
Right .
Kind of interested in politics
so D C would be an option
and I do n't know .
It 's just hard because that 's not really yeah where I 'm at
but I mean we 're both sort of like we do n't know where life is taking us
and
Hard to start a relationship when that
yeah ,
so what do we do
you know do we make decisions based on each other
I mean this was just the second weekend we 've seen each other
so he 's coming here over Labor Day weekend --
mhm .
and then because my schedule gets so crazy starting in the middle of October I am going to go there the first weekend of October .
That was kind of hard for us to decide
you know he has n't even been here yet .
I have n't seen him since the Fourth of July weekend
and we decided well you know let 's go ahead
I see .
I think . .
No I have to come back because I do n't think all my stuff will fit in our vehicles .
So I have to come back .
But , yeah .
%huh .
it 's a lot of airport shenanigans .
I was really upset .
I did n't know .
%huh ?
I did n't know .
yeah , %uh
It 's not my fault .
It 's going to be awful .
What ?
It 's going to be awful this trip home .
Why ?
Because I 'm leaving here at uh-huh . six in the evening , uh-huh . getting to San Francisco at %uh , eleven in the morning , uh-huh . and then hanging around the airport until kid Ted gets out of work
Wait a minute .
The same morning is n't it ?
yeah .
uh-huh .
earlier
Hang around the airport until when ?
Hanging around the airport until Ted gets out of work .
%um that 's awful .
Like six hours later
%mm I think you should just come here . and then Sunday ,
so I will have slept on the plane .
mhm .
The only sleep I 'll have gotten is on the plane .
uh-huh .
And then Sunday night I 'm taking a redeye which leaves At at eleven fifteen
P M ?
yeah . Because you said redeye
and then get there at
And arrives in , %uh , Chicago at four fifty - seven .
And then you go to Washington .
The only sleep I 'll get is from eleven fifteen to five in the morning , honestly .
Is this the one that goes to Washington ?
%um , no Chicago and then Syracuse .
387.98_388.72_A: oh that 's nice .
my original one went to Washington and then Syra-
Maybe you should take that one , though , because it comes earlier , does n't it ?
No , it was n't an option for some reason
oh .
Maybe it was full or something .
%um , but still , you know , maybe you should just get on the next plane , instead of waiting around for Ted .
You 'll be back here by the time he gets there .
You would .
yeah .
yeah .
Well maybe not because if connections , ca n't go direct .
Whine .
%um , but you 're going to go mountain biking ?
Maybe .
That would be fun .
Does he have a mountain bike for you ?
yeah
Does he ?
Well apparently , because he offered .
Because he offered ,
yeah .
And I would imagine that he would know that you 're not travelling around with your bicycle .
Right .
And that you do n't get to keep yours as a souvenir .
Right .
Or anything fun like that .
437.08_438.30_B: it 's not a mountain bike .
%huh ?
and it 's not a mountain bike anyway .
No ,
and in some of your letters it sounds like you would n't really want to keep it , really .
Just
I did go up a mountain on it .
But
%huh ?
I did go up a mountain , well , not on it , with it .
oh .
Pushing it .
Do you have legs of steel ?
No . I have knees of pain .
You have knees of pain
you have **ouchies** .
I forgot to delete **ouchies** from
yeah
you told me .
Did I tell you that ?
And they said **ouchies** ?
yeah .
And I ,
yeah ,
I explained a little bit . Trying %um very hard not to be silly .
it 's very difficult to explain this with any kind of straight face
Really ?
I did n't mind that I was smiling , but without , like ,
you ca n't
how do you explain it ?
I 'm very silly
and I say **ouchies**, because it 's %ah .
And the funny thing is it was Becky that questions it .
Because Becky speaks such , you know , standard English .
She speaks standard English .
Right .
Standard vocabulary
but **ouchies** just really struck her as something very odd .
He
yeah .
And my other thing to tell you , what ?
shower today .
What ?
I do n't get a shower today . oh that 's gross . I 'm sorry because I 'm talking to you on the phone instead
because you 're going to go on the ,
why ca n't you take quick shower ?
They close at ten .
All ,
well ,
oh , oh no .
That 's right .
oh , I 'm sorry .
It 's okay .
You were supposed to get a shower were n't you ?
yeah .
yeah .
%um , oops ?
It 's all right .
I was here .
I have funny things on me .
So I went to the doctor .
But I made an appointment for seven .
And by ten of eight , and I still had n't been seen ,
and I had just gotten my name called .
So I had to come back , because I was going to call you at eight .
%hm .
yeah .
And ,
yeah .
All my **ouchies** are always skin **ouchies** .
I think of this .
And all your **ouchies** are always in- inner **ouchies** %huh
You got new skin ouchies ?
New skin ouchies .
%hm .
They 're not ouchy at all , actually .
they 're just there .
And they 're very disturbing .
I 'm really worried , actually To , %uh , see anybody ,
so nobody ,
but %um , I could n't get a or two in .
Are you going to camp ?
%huh ?
Are you going to camp ?
I do n't know about that either .
I wanted to .
But
But , all I have is my own car .
And it 's a two hour drive ,
and it 'll be at night ,
and I 'll be by myself , in my car .
And what about tomorrow morning ?
I could go tomorrow morning and turn around and come back tomorrow evening .
oh , you were going to come back tomorrow evening ?
Well I have to . What Because , they 're coming back tomorrow evening .
I guess I do n't have to .
I could stay there all by myself .
But %mm %uh . I 'm kind of bored of being by myself ,
they left yesterday , so I 've been by myself an awful lot because I did n't have a job today .
mhm .
So , you know , I 'm kind of not looking forward to that , or anything .
So . I do n't
what do you think ?
it sounds a little scary to drive , you know , in your car .
Alone at night .
%eh yeah .
That far .
yeah .
So maybe I should wait until tomorrow .
But see the other thing is , I do n't know when they 're coming back tomorrow .
mhm .
So if they 're coming back tomorrow morning , then we 'll pass each other on the way .
mhm .
And that would be really bad .
mhm .
I would really be unhappy .
mhm .
What do I do ?
It sounds like you probably do n't go to camp this weekend .
%eh , that means do n't go to camp this summer .
You have n't gone ?
No .
You went for the Fourth of July .
m- ,
oh right .
Not my camp though .
oh you did n't
I just wanted to go st-
%huh ?
You did n't go to your camp ?
No not at all .
We just stayed at George Miranza 's .
What %hm .
I mean it was nice ,
but I wanted to see my camp .
I want to go for a walk on my road .
Of course I wanted you to be there .
But , you know . I ca n't be mean ,
you 're almost home .
No you 're not !
So do I skip school ?
I do n't think you 'll have to .
%uh why ?
No I do n't have to .
But you come in at ten .
No I do n't think you ,
yeah .
You come in at ten ,
and I got to leave at noon .
yeah .
That 's not fun . At all .
It 's better than nothing .
yeah
maybe
yeah
and then
It actually just might make me cry
and then
And then the food .
That 'll be what day ?
That 'll be Monday .
yeah
Then when will you some to Rochester ?
685.61_687.71_A: I can co-
I do n't know .
When are you going to Rochester ?
%mm soon as I 've overcome jet lag , probably .
Well , by that time , I ca n't g- ,
then it wo n't be until the weekend .
I can go on Monday night .
I can go to Rochester .
I do n't assume that you 'd be going there Monday night .
But I can get there Tuesday , because I do n't have another class until Thursday . Because Iggers is out of town .
yeah ,
I could do that maybe .
you 'd go to Rochester on Tuesday ?
yeah ,
maybe .
Please ?
okay
aw .
You 'll just say okay ,
and then I 'll think you are ,
and then you 'll say no .
are you going to say no later ?
%um , no .
I think I 'll go .
You think you 're going to go on Tuesday ?
Where are you going to stay ?
I have to find a place .
Where are you going to stay while you find a place ?
%um , I do n't know .
I guess I 'll come back home in the evenings .
That 's how much I need it .
I could go to Buffalo .
I was going to %uh say you could do that .
And we could drive .
I 'd ,
yeah .
yeah ,
that would be okay
or we could take a bus mhm . both ways .
%mm , we 'd have to park my car somewhere .
oh . oh ,
well I forgot you 'd have your car .
I forgot a-
oh I could take a bus to there too .
%huh ?
I could take a bus
I just do n't want to drive my car back and forth , like every day .
Right .
I do n't mind driving back and forth everyday if you 're going to be there with me .
oh you 'd do that ?
yeah , I need to find a place .
Will you come see me on Tuesday ?
mhm .
I 'd be much happier .
mhm .
oh yeah .
Much , much happier .
good whew .
I 'm out of the doghouse .
Like
What ?
yeah .
oh yeah ,
there 's something else .
%huh .
There 's something else .
What 'd I do ?
No , no .
It 's what you did n't do ,
and you whined about it .
Did n't get to see your , %um , sun sai in their bathing suit .
yeah .
oops .
Hi Karen .
Funny Aron .
oh , but there was something else that was funny ,
where did it go .
There was something that was really funny .
You said something really funny .
oh , it was something about your decision .
oh . %um a bad , not a hard decision because that would imply that you had the part that
and it was n't you that had the problem .
mhm di-
That was really funny .
I laughed .
I really did . .
And also you sent me very nice mail
and I was upset
That was long mail I sent .
yeah , that one was really big .
but I think the typing was
you know you have forty - four pages of this stuff ?
Really ?
Forty - three
I have some information about this call .
That 's cool .
So type forty - three pages you know and not of normal spacing .
I fixed it all so it short like the email kind of copy short , you know .
like halfway across the scr-
forty - three
screen
%um weird margins ,
but yeah
my mom said you really enjoyed
She
yeah
you mentioned that Je-
I have n't spoken to her really
I have n't spoken to her about it
so I did n't really get to hear about it .
But I 'm glad
that was nice .
yeah
the censored version
and then I saw that they wanted to give it to your grandparents
mhm yeah
But yeah
I do n't really see where
mom wanted to see you with edit
%huh ?
Did she ask you for help editing it ?
No she did n't because I saw that you offered that I would
and I would have had no problem ,
but
%huh ?
she wants two revisionists .
She wants to edit you out .
Well , of course .
how was she going to explain that ?
oh right .
yeah
he 's running to Becky 's friend because %um She 's got email and we did n't .
Well I guess that does work , actually .
She could say that . Because all except the **ouchies**
well %mm no , they do n't need to know
but %um yeah that jus-
edit me out . so that I 'm all gone .
%hm are you having fun ?
some .
Emotionally having fun ?
It 's hard there , is n't it ?
yeah , it 's hard .
Some of these calls I made did n't go through .
One of them went through
and it was
About the fall one you mean ?
yeah .
yeah .
trying to figure out
Well , I told him too that I 'll mention to him again on Monday
but , well of coarse Mister Oharshi is not always prompt in his answer either
but maybe Mister Furobiashi too will
Well , I was just wondering should I just pick a date and say I 'm coming .
yeah ,
because I think , you know , at first we were talking about that trying to work it in with the festival
but I do n't think it 's going to be good because of the fact Right that we foreign teachers many of us want to go down to that Sure which is right after you know which we 'll leave like on the Friday night %uh , the third and then be down for the fourth and fifth .
mhm .
so I think probably just work it in to your general scheduling you know like you 've done before and not bother hit it on that weekend .
We- ,
yeah .
okay .
Well I 'm , %um ,
what I was trying to figure I asked some of the students here whether they thought it was better to be there before or after the fall festival
and they said after .
uh-huh .
Do you agree ?
Yes .
Well , mainly because there are ,
especially if it 's just the few days before ,
that 's when the students finally get down to preparing for the festival
and so those days are really yeah . pretty busy .
And so after the festival %uh , they 're a lot freer
so if you could make it after that weekend .
What about , just ,
I 'm looking at the calendar trying to figure ,
what about , say on November
say if I either come in on the ninth or you know the evening of the eighth from wherever ,
I probably will already finish the other countries .
uh-huh .
Maybe make Japan the last place .
Last ,
yeah .
uh-huh .
%um , come in on either the eighth or ninth , and then leave there on Saturday the eleventh .
what are those days ,
do you know what those days might be like ?
Would those be good days ?
Eighth , or eighth and ninth ?
or ninth and tenth .
%uh , ninth is
yes obviously we have our special chapel that week
but that 's just second period
it 's just that there are no classes second period and the students have this special chapel
but you know evenings for a meeting or something would be fine .
I 'd like to meet with the parents again ,
that seemed to be so well received , %uh , last time .
mhm .
%um , and we 've got of coarse some more parents .
yeah , it 's
%um , and now we 're getting a few graduates going back uh-huh . that graduated this year .
yeah .
So , %uh , you know , it 's the beginning of a much bigger -- you would come in on the ninth then ? -- group
Either that or say the late afternoon or the evening of the eighth .
okay .
We have a You know I have n't English department faculty meeting on the eighth ,
but
And that goes until what time ?
Well they do n't start until five ten .
oh , okay .
Five ten till
So it would be better to come in on , like the morning of the ninth or like before noon on the ninth ?
yeah .
Or around noon or whatever .
yeah ,
yeah . it would be okay .
oh .
%uh , okay .
Put down A M and then leave Saturday , %um , sometime .
uh-huh .
Whenever .
Because I 've been trying to put this together
but I did n't know how to organize it .
I really wanted to organize it
yeah
%uh , you know J C J C has been the kingpin of this %uh , group .
Now Mister Furobiashi the last time I did hear from t- ,
or , no I guess it was a graduate that was just over there and came back
and she said when she talked to him that he indicated there were not many %um interested in studying in the U S because they were a not very motivated group .
yeah .
the present check at your students ,
yeah .
Now the first year we have about seventeen or eighteen in the study abroad class Great In the first year ,
and the first year bunch are different
I mean oh they seemed to be more motivated
so it 's true that I 'm not sure how many there will be in the second although there are two second year students in the class this year
mhm .
So , %uh ,
but I do n't know where ,
I 'm not ,
I have n't talked to them yet to see Now , they 're interested or just what ? what they 're thinking about .
mhm .
%um , well , you can , %uh , talk with them and see %uh whether they 're interested in studying , actually studying abroad or planning on it or anything
then we 'll know a little better uh-uh . whether I need to have two days there yeah . or I could fly in in the morning and out the next morning , or , you know , what would work best mhm . cause I do n't want to wear out my welcome
Excuse me for coughing on this .
Well , no , that 's okay .
My goodness .
That was a native speaker 's cough .
oh .
And , %uh , you know it 's not that he ca n't .
He 's got the smarts .
yeah .
He 's just been a little bit unmotivated .
mhm .
%uh , June is doing much better .
yeah .
%uh , she had , %uh ,
it was a hard start .
She kept falling asleep in class .
You ca n't do that in an American classroom .
mhm
yeah .
And , %uh , you know she was trying to memorize the whole book
and were saying no you 've got to use the book , you know
you 've got to use the vocabulary .
We do n't care if you memorize it .
We do n't care if you make mistakes .
mhm
You 've just got to try to use it .
She was looking for perfection .
mhm .
She 's relaxing a little bit and , %um , is coming along .
Hiroki unfortunately he 's , you know , minimal .
mhm .
He 's doing the minimal .
But there is another Japanese girl in his class who did n't come through J C J C
she 's a high school graduate mhm . and is very unmotivated , very poor attitude and is just %um , really resistant .
I 'm not quite sure why she 's here you know
uh-huh
and %uh Hiroki has appointed himself as her protector
oh dear .
and consequently she 's failing
%mm
and by her testing she should be the top student in the class
oh
she could be easily
but she you know just puts on the air that she 's not interested
and mhm we had some knock down drag outs with her .
%mm
She 's just really immature the other Japanese girls say ,
oh , she 's just
you know , it 's immaturity .
mhm .
But , %uh , because he just identifies with her mhm . you know he is not performing to where he could perform or should perform .
mhm .
And so when she 's not around he does better %uh you know , not great but better .
%mm .
So he ,
and it 's real interesting , you know ,
I do n't know at what point I will call up his cousin ,
you know his aunt and uncle live here yeah , I know mhm in town
and %uh , this has got to be a little bit of a problem because his cousin is a gal
she just passed the bar exam and has set up her own law practice .
oh , brother .
a couple of weeks I guess
and then he 's going to try to you know find a job and stuff like this
okay
but he 's been hooked up with %um yeah different programs
but %uh %um I 'm trying to think what else is going on %um what else is news
Chris and Michelle
mom and dad %um
What 's Nathan doing ?
Did you hear about that ?
No
%uh let 's see
how do I put this
%um %um %uh he actually was caught stealing
oh really
yeah
and there could be certain charges pressed
but %um %um that 's going to be worked out
I mean that happened like four weeks ago
%uh
So it 's pretty much just settled
but he was %uh at the lumber yard
yeah
they had %um they had %uh a detective %um %ah yeah who was
and he was caught selling you know to a person lumber
So yeah
that 's
I had forgotten all about that %um
Well you mentioned that
I was under the impression that you 'd already know ab-
yeah
I know
that 's okay
did he always worked this way
yeah
Do n't worry
I 'm not worried
yeah
%uh it was one of those
yeah
in fact I was the last one to find out
Well next to last
wait
yeah
right right
it was just one of those things
yeah
%um So that has to go via the court
so
yeah
well like each kid has to go through theirs I guess %huh
yeah
there 's always something new
yeah
So yeah
that was interesting
but %um
%mm %mm
So yeah
that 's really
I mean that yeah I guess would be kind of like the major news then %uh
yeah
%uh see
well I mean last time I talked to you I did n't think I started school
yeah
no
well I 'm back into school
Sara is in school
%um
Sara is working with children right ?
%um Sarah what are you doing right now
you 're not working at the hospital are you
You 're at the V A hospital
she 's working at the veteran 's hospital
uh-huh
she does like %uh like group counseling and stuff like that
and
uh-huh
I 'm here with two sisters from Celon
Right
And that 's the island next to India
yup
and I think it 's pretty neat that you married a girl that 's from India u-
oh they think it 's neat
yeah
yeah
yeah
well Sara should be gone
but hopefully she 's going to go back there this summer
so
oh good
%uh this Summer I should be coming home
yeah
well would you know what
do you have any tentative %uh
No
I have no
it will probably
I have no idea
probably July August
oh yeah
yeah
she 'll be back by
she go in the Spring
uh-huh
So yeah
ooh yeah
that 's fun
that 'll be
well see I
this is for both of us
it 's our last year of residence
yeah
And then once we-
you know we 'll have to write our dissertation
but %um We wo n't have to be going to school and stuff like this
but
oh that 'll be nice
that 's thirty years of school %huh
So
oh yeah
really
so that aspect will be done
and then %um
so yeah
mhm
So I 'm trying to think what else is going o-
are you following the pope 's visit in the United States ?
yeah
yeah
yeah
he was a
it turned out very good
That 's good
I heard some lady died while he was saying mass or something
oh there 's a lot of people I 'm sure statistically there 's a good chance of someone dying
yeah
yeah
%um the sense was good because %um
oh
a lot
oh yeah
and he has to yield his presence
uh-huh .
You know how he has his presence and people are attracted to his presence and yeah yeah feel that that whole phenomena 's still
yeah
%um
Because the Italians made it sound that he was n't getting much attention
And the reporters were n't ready
and he was n't getting %uh good coverage in the United States
Well I know before h-
well that may be true %uh
I mean to some extent I have n't
like it 's like I have a
yeah
I do n't watch T V
so I do n't know what 's on T V
but %um %um the news-
uh-huh
Well see before they had various theologians who are critics of them yeah who were %um you know saying that you know he 's not in touch and all this stuff
yeah
there was that aspect
but once he was here the amazing thing you know
because it does n't make any difference what the press says uh-huh because once yeah he has those huge crowds yeah yeah and you know there 's still like
mind boggled that you know he gets these huge crowds
yeah
yeah
And his %um ability to have like instant conversions
I mean I 've known tons of people
and they 're just there to have instant conversion
yeah
that 's good
So I mean it doe-
I mean granted he
the process does n't necessarily help
Right
but there 's something about him where he does n't need the press
yeah
yeah
I mean it
yeah
I mean because he 's able to get the %um
you know so that
yeah
I mean in in j-
oh I guess you just become so it 's so much part of What you expect
there will be this qu-
like they 'll bring up all these like like statistics how people even while they like the pope they disagree with what he says
uh-huh
I mean they always do
so you kind of oh yeah that 's normal just become accustomed to it
Right
But
%uh I know
but just it 's amazing %um you know you know people who have an incredible affect
I mean I do n't know
I do n't know what it is
but %um
So yeah
yeah that I 've been following pretty closely you know through the papers and stuff
but %um yeah
so he 's leaving about right now
he 'll be leaving pretty soon
yeah
because he 's only staying five days
yeah
he leaves tonight
%uh
So
yeah
so did
how was Julius stay back at
I really have n't even seen her since she got back
I only
one of the sisters came down to Sicily
so they sent me the letter .
yeah
%uh I was just wondering how her family was doing
yeah
I have no idea
so I have to go to Italy to find out
right
yeah
because I have n't like %um
in fact Mark is trying to get hold of John yeah yeah because yeah I had written because he wants to see about me
Mark was thinking about going to some type of vocational school
%um And John is in the school %uh in Saginaw or Lancing areas
and
yeah
yeah
Saginaw I think
but I do n't know
yeah
So I 'm trying to think of %um what else is happening in the big world here
Yes
it 's just basic ever-
we 're back to the grinding stone of papers and %uh stuff like that
so
yeah
yeah
I with one of the people I teach with %um
%uh like he 's principally responsible for all the English translations for John Paul 's work
%uh I see
%uh that 's nice
yeah
%um so it was
%uh it 's funny to hear they 're there
but %um I 'm trying to think what else is
I just spur of the moment called
I had no i-
I was like well there 's something
what time is it right now in Italy ?
okay
%um it 's twenty to nine
okay
We already changed our time
did you guys ?
I hope I did n't
we sent it back
I know that 's coming up pretty soon
I do n't
%uh yeah
we do it before you guys do
okay
so it 's nine thirty
No
it 's twenty to nine eight thirty
it 's eight thirty
oh good
oh you 're only like five hours behind right now or ahead if I
four or five behind
yeah
yeah
yeah
right
right
gosh so what 's
you know I want to ask %um how is this with %uh
Is there anything ?
Is that just more or less what it is ?
it 's pretty much anything that 's going to happen or not going to happen is pretty much done right ?
%ah I think so
yeah
yeah
How 's the mail order
I think they 're doing pretty good because I do n't have too much contact with them
Right
right
And so I really have no idea to tell you the truth
yeah
%um see yeah because I know that this Summer they did a vocational camp
but I have no idea how it went Right Because I 'm being down in Sicily
you know we 're down
yeah
oh yeah
I know you 're
I do n't know %mm %mm
yeah
I 'm surprised you guys have a house there
wow
yeah
we have two houses in Sicily
oh really
yeah
we 're twenty minutes apart
right
right
and %eh next year we should be going to Fatima
oh wow
that 'll be a big break for you guys then
yeah
yeah
the first of October
some of the sisters made like
how many of them
there was this
eight sisters that made their final vows
okay
And on the twenty - ninth of October fourteen sisters make their first vows
How many ?
fourteen
good
and they 're the ones that went
Diana was with them
Well that would 've been the group of Di
okay
She knows them
yeah
okay
and then we 'll have three that enter novitiate
okay
good
I do n't know how many well %eh come and do the
%eh I do n't know
yeah
well I was telling s-
I seldom
you g-
I do n't know how you guys do things
but %um like if there 's any of the sisters in Rome like
the midwest
they should go to Stevenville
uh-huh
yeah
I think that would be great because I you know like the
I do n't know if you the Dominican sisters in Nashville
uh-huh
I was very influential helping them get sisters in the Tuperville and also %um The Daughters of Saint Paul
yeah
The Daughters of Saint Paul are good sisters
yeah
in America I have a very close %ah you know relat-
I 've helped him out in so many different ways yeah getting their religious ed programs started
but %uh
parishes
and then help them with their vocations
and
%uh %uh one of our sisters has a sister in that order
right
yeah
they kind of been around
they have been at the trench
I mean
yeah
because they always
of course the ones that I really know are from Cleveland
and %uh uh-huh %uh they said that you know of course they still have some troubles like with the %um Italian sisters
but %um uh-huh yeah yeah I do n't know what they meant
I mean I do n't know what exactly they meant by that
but I mean in general I mean they have like a moderate increase in vocation uh-huh something like that
but %um
yeah
that 's
I 'll
but if you ever get a chance
we have a sister that lives in Illinois
What do you mean
she lives there ?
I mean %um her family is from Illinois
So how are you ?
I 'm fine .
How are you ?
I 'm alright .
I 'm
You sound really far away .
I think this is a really bad connection because , there 's a little bit of a lag .
And it 's really **staticky** .
Do I sound **staticky** to you ?
No , you sound quite clear .
oh .
Well I suppose that 's okay .
I 'll just have to put up with it then .
okay .
So how are you doing ?
I 'm well ,
I 'm all right .
I 'm okay ,
but , %eh , you know , do you remember how I was feeling when I was in and I just wanted to like quit the program , and I 'm sick of it ,
and
yeah .
I 'm feeling that way again .
oh no .
So .
yeah
it 's kind of
do you go through like a three monthly cycle or something .
I think that something like that is true .
when
let 's see
what time of the year is it ?
I mean , %hm .
it 's high summer .
yeah .
Well when I was feeling really bad in it was like **Marchish** , right ?
Mayb-
yeah .
February .
I do n't know
it seems like it 's been so
maybe you should check out your biorhythms .
%ah okay .
So how are you ,
how are things going ?
%um , oh Joseph , I do n't know .
I like what I 'm doing
but I am so isolated .
And , this is like the best present I 've had the whole year I 've been here .
You 're kidding ?
Because I do n't have anyone to talk to .
oh , come on ,
you 're kidding , right ?
w-
No , I 'm not kidding .
It is so hard to talk to people here .
You mean like Scottish folks ?
Then
well just the British in general .
I find them sort of , really reserved .
And they ,
you know how Americans just kind of jump in and oh hi , let 's be friends kind of thing .
You know , we 're stuck in a horrible situation together ,
so let 's laugh .
uh-huh .
and , the British do n't jump in right away
and , I mean once they make friends with you , then they 're nice to you .
But , I do n't know what the secret is of cracking the code . You know .
So .
uh-huh .
And you have n't cracked it with anybody yet ?
Well , I mean , partly I 'm so busy .
oh god , this course Joseph was so overwhelming this year .
Wow .
I mean , we were in class about six hours a day ,
and then you had to go home and do about twenty - five hours worth of homework , to get ready for the next day .
Just , you know
No c-
so like worse than Middlebury .
165.00_177.54_B: oh , oh , worse ,
it was like as bad as Middlebury at its most intense ,
but it lasted all year ,
it was n't over in nine weeks .
oh my God !
I know
I have so much gray hair .
I mean , I must have ten times more gray hair than nine months ago .
oh , no .
You 're going to look like a little old lady .
It 's incredible .
It 's just incredible .
And then , we had our exams in June
and , so that part 's all over with ,
and now I 'm just doing dissertation stuff .
so it 's fun now .
But %um ,
Because you 're sort of working on your own and self - directed ?
yeah ,
well , there 's not so much daily pressure , you know , where you have to produce for everyday ?
%huh .
So it 's a lot better .
%um , and Edinburgh is so beautiful .
And right now there 's all these festival things going on .
And do you have time to go out and see them , and enjoy them ?
Well I 'm making time
I 'm doing something once a week for sure . e- %huh . you know
So , %eh the other day I took a bus trip into the highlands
and that was really good you know .
And it 's beauti-
uh-huh .
oh , that must be really great .
It 's beautiful here .
it 's really beautiful .
and the weather is good right now .
This is like a record or something .
We 've had all this sunshine and blue sky
and it 's been in the eighties ,
and Wow nobody can believe it .
So , I guess I 'm really lucky .
What was it like in the winter ?
It was like being in the middle of a hurricane .
No .
I mean , the wind blows .
You know , I 'm not that small .
I would n't say I 'm a tiny woman .
uh-huh .
And the wind blows me into the hedge . You know ?
I mean , it 's like it comes off the North Sea and knocks you on your ass .
Are you right on the water ?
%uh , really close .
oh yeah .
Can you swim ?
yeah
No .
It 's too cold .
Really , really cold ?
You 'd be nuts if you went in .
So nobody swims ?
No , there is a beach , actually , down the coast .
There 's a beach you can get to from here ,
but I have n't been there yet .
%hm . And so do people like sunbathe and
yeah .
yeah .
But they do n't go in the water ?
No they do .
You can go in down there .
it 's a little bit south from here uh-huh . and on the east coast ,
and you can get there easily from here by bus .
%hm .
And people go there .
But I have n't been there yet .
%hm .
So are you Anyway . going to get to stay there a while after you 're done with your program to like sightsee and stuff ?
Well , %um , I guess I 'm just going to do mostly like one or two day things . You know ?
uh-huh .
And because it 's so small and you can go all over on the bus .
%huh .
And %um , there 's a student travel %um agency on campus
and I can get sort of uh-huh . student discount on things , you know ?
%mm .
So I can go away for a weekend ,
and it 's not too expensive .
Do you stay at like hostels and stuff ?
Well no ,
I mean actually , you know , B and B's or whatever .
Really ?
not too bad ,
yeah .
So are there are other non Brits in the program ?
There are n't any Brits in the program .
There are six of us in my class .
yeah .
Myself and an Italian woman .
oh oh she must be great fun .
She 's great ,
she 's great .
She 's %um Sarda .
She 's what ?
391.97_393.19_B: She 's from Sardinia .
oh .
%um , and then the four guys are all Arab .
There 's the Sudanese and a Moroccan .
uh-huh .
oh , and the Moroccan guy knows Hamunses by the way .
It 's a very small world .
yeah ,
%um , and two Libyan guys .
Really ?
And that 's it in my year , in my class .
It 's a very
So have you been able to get close to them ?
yeah ,
the guys are really nice , you know ,
but we 've had so much work to do that you know we do n't really have much chance to you know spend a lot of time with each other .
%um , but , Marie Antoinette and I have become friends .
uh-huh .
So ,
and she 's a lot of fun .
She 's very interesting , actually .
I 'll bet .
she went across the Sahara desert by camel .
, her husband is a writer ,
his name is Michael Ascher .
Michael what ?
Ascher
+unknown+
Ascher ,
Ascher ,
I 've never heard of him .
when they got married , their honeymoon was a nine month trip across the Sahara desert .
Ugh .
I think they started out in Morocco and made their way down and all the way %um , through the Sudan .
oh my god !
yeah .
Can you imagine ?
yeah .
oh yeah .
I think she was %um , the first European woman to do that .
oh my god .
That must have been hellish .
he wrote a book about it .
%hm .
So
Is he American ?
No , he 's English .
uh-huh
interesting
so , her Arabic must be really good .
It 's pretty good .
It 's not any better than mine .
Well , your Arabic is really good .
it 's gotten pretty good , actually .
I 've learned some interesting stuff here this year .
Are you doing simultaneous stuff ?
No , we 're not doing any simultaneous .
Why not ?
Not at all .
Because , %um , for one thing you have to be a lot better at Arabic than I am to do it .
But , %um , mostly we spend most of our time on translation .
%hm .
And , only a very little bit on interpreting .
And the interpreting we do is a consecutive liaison interpreting .
What does that mean ?
It means that , %um , you , actually ,
it
well you do it by paragraph .
mhm .
small bits of speech .
And , in some ways , it 's harder than simultaneous %um , because , you have to not only remember what was said , but you have to get all the facts right , you know ?
You ha-
Right ,
right .
You 've got to remember it all
and
yeah ,
all the dates and amounts and , you know .
So , there 's a lot of practice in note - taking , and devising your own sort of set of symbols that will jog your memory mhm . you know because you ca n't keep notes on a whole paragraph of what somebody says .
Right .
you just ca n't do it .
%um , no ,
I talked to **Dougo** .
oh , how 's he doing ?
Well , I guess .
well the thing is , **Dougo 's** kind of annoying me a little bit .
oh why ?
Well , the first
%uh first of all ,
well I think he sort of knew I did n't want him to be here .
yeah .
But still he oh I want some place to bring people .
It 's like how long are you going to be here .
uh-huh .
So I really %uh , do n't think that it 's very appropriate or so forth .
Like you 're on vacation ,
I mean , what 's the point .
yeah .
And it 's just sort of
I 'm just
that kind of annoys me
it 's kind of a
Well you know why he wants to bring people there right ?
What 's that ?
You know why he wants to bring people there right ?
Why ?
Well you know . His boyfriends and stuff .
Yes ,
but I did- ,
I 'm sorry ,
I do n't want another Lee Worthy , okay ?
yeah ,
well
And I do n't ,
I 'm ,
put it this way ,
I do n't think it 's beyond that , okay ?
%huh .
I do n't think it 's be- ,
well I think Lee is actually a little bit cleaner than .
It 's what I 'm sort of kind of figuring out now after a while .
uh-uh .
And I just do n't like it ,
you know what I mean ?
uh-huh .
This is not a motel , okay ?
oh , I know .
okay ?
And it just kind of annoys me .
yeah .
uh-huh .
It 's like are you going to be showing up ?
I do n't care .
I 'll show up whenever I please .
So .
Anyway ,
and then .
Anyway , we were supposed to do something with Er- ,
I mentioned , well then why do n't we get together with Eric or something Friday .
uh-huh .
You know , let 's you know , go out to a movie and so forth .
I wanted to see this Species movie which was pretty good .
last night , yeah .
yeah ,
but the thing is that he never calls , never does anything . okay ?
And so all I get now is I get some message ,
well I want to get a hold of a key ,
when can I get it .
He wants me to straighten up or something .
It 's like I 'm not going to straighten up so this can be like your little nest .
I 'm sorry .
And it just sort of annoys me .
yeah .
You know if you want to do any of that other stuff , just go somewhere else .
yeah .
I do n't know sweetie ,
I just
No , I just think it 's bullshit ,
I mean I have to b-
its
I know ,
I just think you 're getting a little worked up about th-
No !
I 'm sorry ,
I do n't got time for this crap , okay ?
That 's about it , okay ?
y-
I have to feed some animals now , and worry about that now .
And then this other -- oh are you staying over there ? -- rubbish .
It 's just .
What 's that ?
Are you staying over there ?
%uh , I 'm thinking about it .
yeah .
yeah ,
well then why not , you know <E_S ?
I just wish you would mention to me before you offer .
I did .
Well I was kind of saying ,
I was kind of hesitant .
yeah
I do n't know if you asked me .
You mentioned it ,
and then it came up to discussion after you 'd mentioned it to **dougo** .
But beforehand , I 'd kind of been kind of like negative on it .
So .
I do n't know ,
I guess I never really thought that it would be that big a deal , you know .
yeah ,
Well
I mean %um , I just think that it 's largely because you 're in a really high stress situation now .
I 'm in a situation where I need full control of my environment .
I know that .
yeah ,
so .
I was just
And so I think that 's why you 're
And then
no
but anyway he does n't call ,
and I just
all he d- ,
I mean Friday ,
and all he did was give this message today , I want a key .
I mean talk about a little bit rude ,
I 'm sorry .
Well .
That 's really rude , if you ask me .
It 's just like , I just want to use you for something here .
I mean just
I do n't think it 's like that sweetie
I think you 're overreacting .
Well , I think the behavior indicates that , at least .
at least , you know , Mister very sensitive and aware of other people 's behavior is obviously not super aware of his own a little bit .
So .
183.89_184.98_A: No
you know that
Well , no ,
but you know that he acts abrupt like that anyway , right ?
Well I 'll just .
I mean
I 'll act abrupt then also ,
so it 's sort of funny .
Well
But anyway . The movie was good yesterday , though .
I might call him back Monday .
Well sweetie , what am I supposed to do ?
You know .
oh you 're not supposed to do anything ,
I 'll take care of it .
%ah I am going to mention to him that I did think it was sort of rude that he did n't do that
and all I get is this message blah , you know .
Well , you could ,
yeah ,
I mean I think it 's valid for you to yell at him for standing you guys up and stuff .
And
Well it was n't official plan ,
but , it 's not as if he gave me a number to contact him at .
yeah .
yeah ,
so I was %um a little bit put off by it . yeah . You know .
and I was saying
Well he could probably say that he felt put off by you too .
So .
I do n't think so .
I was the one who suggested going out and doing something .
yeah .
The only thing he can be say put off by me is that my life hangs in the balance , and I would like to be left alone .
I do n't think that that 's unreasonable . yeah . You know ,
you know , it 's
Well , I know ,
I agree ,
but you know , %um , also , if , you know , %uh , you 're not going to be there During this week or two , or whatever
The way I kind of see it is like if you want a a soft place to lie your head down and fall asleep , and wake up , cook food or whatever and , putz around once in a while , that 's fine .
But if you want a place where , you know , it 's time for a Saturday Night Fever party , I 'm sorry ,
that 's
oh , come on .
he 's not quite like that ,
I mean good grief .
Yes ,
but still ,
that 's kind of my , you know .
no
he 's got people that he has n't seen for quite a while .
But do n't they live somewhere
Well
You know what I 'm saying .
Well , not all of them .
%eh , I mean , I get the impression not all of them can go back to that place .
I mean have you ever actually talked to him about it .
No ,
but anyway .
Well , because , , you know , it 's
oh , I understand ,
I think I understand what you were saying now .
yeah .
I think I figured it out that ,
yeah .
So he would like to have a place where %eh they can come and visit him .
yeah
and so It 's fine with me
Never mind ,
I thought about a hilarious word play .
But anyway ,
never mind .
What ?
I do n't want to say .
But %uh , it 's a word play on what you just said ,
it 's kind of a **switcheroony** ,
it 's ,
but it comes i-
there 's some truth to it , you know .
oh .
oh .
what is it ?
Well they can visit him and come on him .
%ah , %ha , %ha .
%uh , %uh .
Instead of coming and visiting .
yeah ,
well , okay .
I just
But , I mean , anyway .
Anyway .
So , my thought on the whole thing is that you know , if you visited him , you would n't want to have to be you know , spent panting and spending every second of the day , with him only . You know what I 'm saying and that probably part of the reason that it would be nice to actually stay with him is that you could also go and visit the sights or whatever and
Where ?
What are you talking about ?
In Japan .
I 'm not going to Japan .
No ,
but I mean
I 'm trying to
maybe in ten years , but , no time soon .
No , no ,
but , no , you know what I 'm saying .
When you are visiting a town and you stay at someone 's house and you ca n't ever do anything on your own and stuff like that .
So
oh , I do n't mind
he does stuff on his own .
%uh , you know , I mean there 's a difference between guests
and there 's a difference between ownership , I think .
I think that
I know .
but
There , I mean ,
if I live somewhere , you know , I can rearrange the furniture .
yeah .
But if I 'm staying somewhere , it does n't mean I 'm in jail .
I mean just because I 'm in a motel , does n't mean I 'm going to repaint the walls .
But it does n't mean that I 'm obligated to stay there either .
oh well I know
but e-
I 'm just saying there are different degrees of , you know
and I do n't think he 's obligated to sit there and hob nob around with me the entire time either .
I would n't want him to .
yeah .
You know I told him ,
I said I have no time to do anything .
And I said I
Well maybe that 's why he was trying
And as soon as I move back here , he 's out .
I totally insist on it .
I do n't care if he never talks to me again .
Because , there 's no way I can study with worrying about keeping somebody awake , or , you know , I have to worry how I 'm dressed , if I 'm clean . You know . Whatever .
yeah
well , I agree with that sweetie .
But , in that case , I think that while
I mean he can stay while I 'm at Erzhebat 's ,
that 's fine .
That 's just
Ex- ,
that was my point .
That was my whole point .
That
yeah
okay .
What is the big deal with just giving him a key and telling him to do what he wants .
And
Well I have to go make a copy too .
Do you want me to , well . Give him the keys and
You know what I 'm saying .
And I 'm kind of thinking about saying , here give me a couple of bucks ,
I 'll make a copy .
yeah ,
or just give him your set of keys one day when you 're studying
and say here ,
and bring it back .
You know , go make a copy
and then bring it back .
And , I mean I do n't think it 's that unreasonable for him to ask for a key when
you know , at least I anyway , yeah . yeah . okay maybe not you , have offered long time ago that oh , yes , you can stay here and **bladyblah** .
yeah .
And he knows that you 're not going to be there .
So I do n't think that it 's unreasonable at all .
okay ,
yeah .
I just think he needs to know that there are limits . Or whatever . That I do n't want it ,
I mean I 'd like to be able to come here , during the day , anytime . And not feel like if I need a book or something
yeah
uh-huh .
I do n't want to feel restrained because it 'll frustrate me uh-huh . and I wo n't be able to concentrate .
Well , I think that that would be reasonable .
Just make an agreement with him you know , after what time of day will you call before you come over . yeah . You know ?
Or , you know , so like , between , %um , eight P M and you know ten A M if I have to come over then I 'll call first .
Like that .
I mean I do n't think that 's unreasonable , you know ?
Or something like that .
yeah .
Because then he can feel comfortable and you can feel comfortable because you know what 's going on . yeah . You know .
yeah .
and plus , you know , you 're going to be at , %uh , Suzanne 's for what , till the eleventh or something ?
No till
Well that 's right .
yeah
when you come back I guess %uh I 'll still be there .
Still be there right .
So
because you 'll be around
Right
so just
But you 'll be over here packing at that time , partially .
yeah partially
sure of course .
I deposited your other rent loan check that came in .
oh good .
How much was it ?
And I
it was nineteen something .
okay .
the thing is I took out two hundred and fifty out of the account .
I 'm going to pay the electric bill .
I 'm going to pay M B N A .
I 'm going to pay %uh some other people .
okay .
That sounds good .
have you played at all ?
I totally forgot how to play
are you kidding me
I 'm so bad at -- Did you ? -- games
but do n't tell him that
I think Diane 's played a few times
tell him I play all the time
%eh %huh ?
Tell him I play all the time at least once a week
well I always get annoyed because every time we go over his parents house as we 're going over there on a Sunday or something they 're all like All right let 's play cards Let 's play asshole when there 's all these other games
Or you have n't thought about %um Ho Chi Minh thing or what did they used to play Pat and those guys %uh
oh Mao
yeah Mao
that 's right
sorry
Ho Chi Minh
that 's a catchy term
I knew it was something like that
and Tim Harrington cheated for the last fifteen years .
I know
I know
but you know he made the rules
so
Is n't that hilarious .
I know
I was thinking about them the other day %um oh because for some reason it was such a silly thought I was thinking about architecture and I think they had a nice house
I started looking
I was thinking about California style homes
yeah
they had a beautiful house
I never actually went to it
but %um I remember Carrie talking about it a lot
they had a really nice house .
It 's just modern
yeah
it was modern
it was sort of silly because it was almost right next door to that It was Tim 's house right ? Crappy house that Pat lived in .
yeah
and I think it was right next to that
yeah
it was Tim 's house
and then his %uh wife moved in yeah . when they got married I think
yeah
she probably took him for half of it now
so
I 'm just joking
Who knows who owns the house
I do n't
that other one too that had a really nice house %um the one whose husband died and then she moved to Los Angeles and they never heard hide nor hair of her again .
%um Arlene was that her name ?
oh
oh
She was Asian
I do n't know whether she was Philippino or what
but she was some kind of Asian
oh I do n't remember who that was
oh
You remember her ?
%uh no
I do n't remember her
yeah
Her husband went down to Mexico Because Arlene was Tim 's wife
okay yeah
and then there was another one -- yeah -- whose husband went down to Mexico and caught some oh that 's right little virus
That 's right
yeah
And they had a really beautiful house right there too
That was really sad
yeah
yeah
Strange little block
but then again in that area people do n't really care about yeah Big house next to small house sort of thing
it 's like you take the view as you get it
and that 's it
yeah
yeah
They build it higher and higher
yeah
mhm
well So how you feeling
you feeling Energetic or tired
or how you going ?
yeah
I 'm starting to get contractions now
yeah
Right
Painful contractions
gee god it 's going to come so fast
yeah
you still have two weeks left do n't you
yeah
but you know probably
oh no less than that
No
two weeks
it was two weeks yesterday .
Ten days
oh
and %uh
no
I actually had a doctor 's appointment yesterday
and %uh Everything is fine
my doctor is like the most non %uh
like I do n't know whether he 's just not interested or he just does n't care or what
but he told me I did n't even have to come in next week if I did n't want to oh if I could find someone to take my blood pressure
%mm
What was it
take my blood pressure and check my urine I think
yeah
I 'm like I have friends that %uh where the hell am I going to find someone to do that
Well when I had Tyson we had something called share care %hm because
well you said that you do n't have %um private
it 's all public there is n't %uh
yeah
there 's no such thing as private here
yeah
so I paid for a private doctor
and %uh if I had private health insurance I could 've had him
but I paid for him
and %um uh-huh he would just do most of my checkups towards the end
like he did it at twenty weeks and then like at twenty - eight weeks
and then %um as of about I think the last month I had to see him once a week now
yeah
I almost could 've bagged those visits
and it 's a good thing he came to Harvey Bay
he does n't come here anymore now that the only private obstetrician that we have in town is only in Mayorborough okay which is a half hour away
yeah
and you basically just sit in the office
and you come in
and they just take your blood pressure
and they talk to you how you 're going
and they might feel around the baby a little bit
and there 's no internal exam of course
and then that 's it
I mean I could go to my doctor and do the same .
so I 'm a little bit torn as to how to go next time as far as %um you know going private at all
yeah
I would be so much different if I had a baby again
I mean well we do plan actually on having more than one
but %uh
yeah
You know I mean I just thought it would be so different
I mean I find that I do n't need to see the doctor
I have no desire to see the doctor you know
yeah
you get a bit afraid you know
like you know I was always good with my visits and did my visits
and I sort of realized that
and I thought I would
yeah
%uh I do n't think I actually did my follow - up with Doctor Stokes because
oh no I did one follow - up .
uh-huh .
but I had to do another one
I just did n't show up for that one because it was sort of ridiculous at that point
the follow - up that he saw me after I had the baby was How 's the baby
how are you ?
yeah
How 's it going
fine
well
your
I know
That 's it
see you
I know
that 's what the doctor does
he makes sure that the baby is head down
%hm
He takes my blood pressure
and that 's it you know
and it 's like you know by the time you 've been pregnant for you know X number of months %hm you 're the one who 's going to know whether there 's something wrong more than the doctor
Yes
I know
So you know it 's all up to movement
if the baby stops moving then you know you do n't call up the doctor
you go straight to the hospital
Absolutely
So
yes
and that 's the scary thing is n't it
oh my god I know
I hate it when he stops moving
you
yeah
actually I was a bit bad too because %um you know you had to keep register of %uh the movement
mhm
oh no
they do n't make us do that
Really
oh you had to count
and %um I 'd just get really lazy some days and just sort of you know lie on the sheet how many times
well it must have been hard for you too because I know like I sit at my computer all day long yeah So you know %uh Like it 's easy for me to tell when the baby is moving
but when I 'm at home or I 'm standing up or I 'm walking around you know you just forget
oh yeah
yeah
time goes on really quickly
I mean I knew %eh things were still going fine
he was pretty active
actually we 're going away tomorrow because %um we had made plans to go to the sunshine coast with my uh-huh . parents
so then we 're going to go now anyway oh with Tyson
and this is going to be
well we took that trip with Tyson when we went of course to the state
uh-huh
You ca n't really plan on doing things with the kid
you just sort of bring him along
and then in January we went to this resort just across the island
and %um mhm That 's when Tyson was about fourteen months
and that was a bit of fun because we you know were staying at a resort
and he was in the pool a lot
and that was a bit of fun
but there was n't much else to do otherwise
So this time where we 're going is that there 's a lot of things to do
we 're going to take him to %um an oceanarium
oh that 'll be fun !
See the fish and seal shows and all this sort of stuff
and then you can even
oh that 'll be great
oh I know
and you can pick up little turtles and all that sort of stuff
and I just ca n't wait
oh
That is going to be so much fun
oh and then we 're going to the gingerbread factory
and they have choo choo trains
it has an animal park where you can pick up baby animals
and
oh I ca n't wait
god
I just ca n't wait
we 're going tomorrow morning
I was just so excited
that 's so funny
I ca n't believe you 're a mother
it 's
you 're going to be calling me up in a year
and you 're going to go oh and we 're going here
and we 're doing this
and we 're so excited
and we ca n't wait
That 's great
I know
I think
no
Right
so there was this one friend
and her daughter is like totally into the Renaissance period
so they go to Renaissance fairs to watch jousting tournaments
oh my god
I try to describe all that to people
I said you know I used to go to Renaissance festivals
and they sort of like uh-huh uh-huh
yeah
They do n't get it %huh
oh god remember that
But that was fun though
well I went with you did n't I
yeah
we went
remember I bought that little %uh -- yeah -- thing
do you still have it ?
oh no
it broke years ago
yeah
the fairy
It broke
oh yeah
it broke in one of my you know
god I do n't know who 's moved more
me or you
but %uh we 're probably neck and neck
oh
yeah
that 's too bad is n't it
that was a nice little piece actually
but %uh yeah
%hm well
Now is your mother still going to come ?
yeah
she 's supposed to come on Saturday
oh wow
yeah
it 's a little bit of bummer because last weekend was mine and Norm 's last weekend alone
and we had errands to do
yeah
oh
we %uh
so our last weekend alone was filled doing errands
oh that 's not good
so she 's coming until the baby is born obviously
well yeah
I do n't know what 's going to happen
she called us
She 's going to stay a long time then is n't she
I do n't
well you know she called up
she was supposed come on the twenty - eighth which is a week from Saturday you now three days before I was due
yeah
And %um She called up about %uh a week and a half ago and asked you know could she come early %mm because %uh you know I guess she 's having problems with Don
she did n't %uh elaborate
she just said can I come early
%mm
and %uh you know of course I said well yeah sure why no- yeah You know
%eh do they still go up and down in their relationship
oh god every six months she calls me up
I 'm leaving Don
I 'm like well that 's good mom
%uh 879.98_880.58_B: shit you know whatever you want to do we all love you
you know we want to support you
and you know I 've learned not to say anything bad about Don
%mm
%uh so %uh you know it 's always just we love you
we want you to do what you want to do
and you know we all support you in your decision
%mm
yeah
you know
and then she 'll call up the next week right And %uh you know does n't say anything does n't even mention that she had an argument that she was thinking of leaving him you know
nothing
uh-huh
yeah
wow
yeah
that 's too bad
but yeah
you know I 'm sitting here
and I have %um this picture
I was just staring at this picture %um over on %uh my %uh bookcase
Like I 'm sitting opposite the bookcase
yeah
and I realized it 's a picture of little naked Tyson
could you enroll in two other courses if you wanted to ?
In addition to the one you 're already in , are there two other things that you 'd also like to take ?
For example .
I know there 's a limit for students who e-
%uh a limit for what ?
You know I 'm thinking a lot about this job that I just took that you know you seem to think is a dead end and obviously does n't make enough money
and you know I do n't know I 'm going to like it .
You do n't know that going into a job .
There 's
I understand that .
Well tha-
I understand that .
You 've taken it
and that 's a
I feel like I just made a big mistake .
Liz I ca n't tell you whether you did or not .
It just feels lousy .
And I just tried for the longest time to figure out what to do .
Liz , Liz , I do n't know whether you made a mistake or not .
I ca n't possibly tell .
I do n't even have enough information to say whether you did or not .
And you will find out .
And if it 's a huge mistake you 'll just quit ,
that 's all .
You have no way of knowing .
Did you tell the public health people that you definitely do n't want that job ?
No
I did n't tell them anything .
oh okay .
is that really such an awful job ?
Sounded to me like a lot of interesting things .
Sounded to me like too much
but it sounded like a very interesting set of things .
Is that something you definitely would not want to do ?
I you had said that was an easier job in some ways .
What ?
Actually I do n't think so anymore because I think that it 's too many things .
for either one of them are you going to have to spend hours preparing outside of the hours that you actually get paid for ?
I do n't know yet .
Because I do n't think that that would be warranted -- -- at the salary that they 're giving you .
I think that you ought to be able to circumscribe your hours very carefully .
I just got this call yesterday from this
I mean I j-
Liz
it was on a message on my machine when I came home from this nurse at a high school nearby saying I should call her about openings in the district that she called me because of one of the letters I wrote to one of the principals oh yeah ? who knows what kinds of openings there are .
mhm .
mhm .
So may-
Lizzy I know how up in the a-
you know when I was in graduate school I spent a lot of time in my last year of college thinking about whether wanted to go into biophysics or wanted to teach little kids .
And I knew it was obviously because what I really wanted to do was go into biophysics but also have my own little kids .
But I went into biophysics .
By the end of the year I 'd met Daddy
and I decided that was going to be it .
I really
Daddy was really going to be the one .
I got very unhappy with the science .
and I just walked out of one lab
and I said no this is it .
I just do n't want it .
I wanted to be teaching little kids .
Because Daddy was at that point noncommittal to say the least .
%um and he was also leaving for Syracuse .
And so a friend of mine sat down with me , Wayne Meyers
and he said he was a very bright guy .
He was the one whose shoulder I cried on when I took Dexadrin that time too for
the doctor had given it to me for cramps
and I ended up getting %um depressed for twenty - four hours .
%um and he said to me you really want to change .
I said yeah I really want to go .
He says well take the bus across the river this afternoon because I had already applied and been accepted to the
I mean it went so far that I applied both to biophysics and to %um Harvard School of Ed .
And I did n't apply to any other ed schools because I figured I could get in there which I had .
And I went across the river that day
and I said can I get into your next year 's class .
And they said absolutely .
And I mean by then it was like May .
Certainly April .
Certainly April not earlier .
And I remember Mama Sadie was upset about it .
But everybody knew why I was doing it
and everybody kn-
it was obvious even to Daddy why I had to do that for a while .
I could n't just study science for a while .
And I was twenty - two . Twenty - one .
and %um yeah I guess I was twenty - two already .
%um and it 's not any rational kind of thing Liz .
It 's hormonal .
It 's absolutely hormonal .
I mean here you are ,
you are thirty .
And it 's no wonder that you do n't know what you want to do .
I did n't know what I wanted to do at that stage .
Well I did
but it was out of reach .
And for you it 's obviously out of reach too .
Unless it works out with Matt you have n't met him .
And therefore I 'm disappointed in how you 're going about it because I 've known so many people who did n't get married and so many people who got married too late to have children .
It 's very sad .
I find it very sad .
I did n't expect that I would be in this position with my children .
Well actually I expected it with Jonathan .
I expected to worry about him not you because he was very slow socially .
and you know you never can tell with life .
There are n't any rules about it
and %uh nobody has written the future .
And it 's %uh %eh prayer
and %uh %eh penitence does n't really help .
It 's going to happen ,
things are going to happen when they happen .
But there are ways to help them along .
There are ways to help them along .
And maybe you 're doing them
but I do n't see it .
I know you went out with some guy the other night .
maybe you are looking actively
but I do n't see it .
So all I can do is sit and worry and be concerned
and I do n't think Can we talk about the job things now ? that
Well what about the job things ?
I ca n't talk about them .
I do n't know anything about them .
You want to tell me about them ?
Well you do n't like the job I just took .
Now wait a moment .
Do n't
Well Daddy says they 're less important than the other stuff
and I agree .
But do n't tell me I do n't like the job you just took Lizzy .
I do n't know enough about it .
You know I raised you
and I thought I was
So maybe I can sign ten hours in the school district doing something else .
Maybe you can .
%eh that would be interesting if you know you have hours during the week that are available .
do n't block them out until you find out whether or not you can take an art course during the week . so that you can have your
I mean you know I 'd like to see you flying down to %um where was it that they had that hiking group San Francisco for the weekends .
mhm
I want to fly out to Michigan and visit Matt .
That 's where I want to fly .
%uh I 'd like to see you do that too .
All I want is your happiness Liz .
And I think I know what will make you happy .
Well I just want to figure out what I want to do with my life .
You know I feel like I 'm never going to figure it out .
Lizzy , you might not .
I have n't figured out mine yet .
You 're a scientist .
I 'm a scientist .
Liz , that 's a pretty poor showing for a scientist .
Ma , are you kidding ?
Look how many days you go into the lab .
I know .
Look what I 've published .
One paper .
So who cares about publishing .
Well that 's what
otherwise , I 'm cooking
and nobody 's eating it .
it 's recycling
it 's it 's working that nobody ever knows about .
That 's not what defines me as a person .
What defines me as a person is my family .
And your failure daughter .
That 's what I 'm feeling sad about at the moment .
I 'm not going to be able to figure out what I want to do .
I just did n't know .
I thought this might be interesting okay .
and maybe
That 's fine .
I do n't
that 's not my big worry about you Liz .
But it 's mine .
And I feel like I did n't know what to do
and then I feel like I took it
and now I feel like it 's a mistake
and now I
Well I 'm telling you
I 'm telling you it 's hormonal .
It 's not rational .
what to do .
You do n't just all of a su-
the heavens do n't open up as Gib wrote
and all of a sudden you know just what you 're going to do .
If you define yourself that way -- -- you 're looking for trouble .
But I just feel like I 'm -- You 're opening yoursel- -- **putty - duddying** around for the rest of my life .
And like I do n't have any specific skills or body of knowledge .
I 'm just sort of this blob .
Lizzy
Lizzy the mo-
Lizzy Daddy feels that way too .
He feels he does n't know anything .
Everybody feels that way .
You just have to get used to that .
You want to count your degrees ?
You want to count the courses you 've had ?
You want to count the work you 've done the jobs you 've had ?
That 's nonsense .
I do n't know .
Like maybe if I were a teacher Everybody always you know and I taught say health , science and art , then I would sort of get this body of knowledge that I would have and this -- Lizzy -- structure to it .
And then I yeah , yeah . Lizzy , Lizzy give it
Lizzy , that 's a dream .
It never happens .
And I can tell you people at all levels
The only people who really think they know something are the people who usually are deficient .
When you do n't know how mu-
But there 's people who have a specific set of skills .
I do n't even feel like I have that sometimes , you know .
It 's a-
what they have to offer .
I do n't have anything to offer .
yeah
because you ca n't %um
%eh Lizzy Lizzy everybody feels that way who 's worth his salt .
Do you know that ?
Is what ?
uh-huh .
You know
so Sure . I get that plus %uh you know the one day a week .
Plus .
And I live modestly you know .
how well I know that .
yeah .
You know this is my theory too to live modestly .
mhm .
Like wearing one dress .
I still have a dress to %uh Micky 's bar mitzvah uh-huh . which is %uh twelve years ago .
yeah .
I 'm still wearing the dress .
yeah
yeah .
And %uh someone saw me in the dress not long ago and said oh what a beautiful dress .
uh-huh .
And I looked at her
and I said oh you are so right .
She should just know %huh
I would n't admit
I would n't admit .
yeah .
That 's right .
And so you 're still busy with all kinds of volunteer work .
oh yes
yeah
all the volunteer stuff I do .
I 'm -- uh-huh . -- active with a state group that 's trying to work for a universal single pair health plan mhm -- on a state level
and we have a nice young Jewish legislator who is %uh going to put in a bill for us this year .
mhm .
We wo n't get it .
It 's a Republican dominated legislature that is %uh cutting off all kinds of services for ordinary people .
Sure .
You know it 's very business oriented .
And %uh I work with another group that 's always trying to get jobs for people who have been laid off .
mhm .
And the women 's international league for peace and freedom I 've been a member for years
but I 'm not really very active
but oh about five years ago %uh they decided %um they wanted
it was the seventy fifth anniversary
mhm .
So they wanted to do something special
so I put together %uh
they had had a play about their own history %uh some years before
so I took and updated it and you know cut out -- Sure sure . -- some stuff
and they have a .
So now I 'm the playwright
so now for the eightieth -- -- they want me to do it a little differently this time
so I 've got that .
mhm .
You know I 've got it sitting here
so I ca n't ignore it
but I really
Sure .
You know that 's not my expertise in any way shape or form
But yeah yeah . They 're making it your expertise right .
So anyway
but it 'll be fun you know to put that together .
Sure sure sure
And %uh I do n't know %um
last weekend %uh Lida and Irv Teisher were in town .
oh .
%uh they have a son who is the %uh
I guess he buys the books for %uh something called Borders which is a bookstore that car-
Yes
we have it here too .
%ah okay
but %mm you know it started in Ann Arbor .
yeah .
Yes .
and he 's the purchaser for the outfit .
%mm .
well I think it 's been three or four years at least but they you know occasionally come in to see him and his wife .
mhm .
And so they spent three or four days in Ann Arbor
and
oh he lives in Ann Arbor
is that it ?
yeah
that 's the home base you know .
Home base
yeah .
yeah .
And %uh %uh Lida and Irv still have some very good friends from the years when they lived here .
Sure .
Sure .
So they stayed with them I guess a couple of nights
mhm .
and they invited in most of their old friends
and I 'm the only relative around really you know that they remember .
oh they do n't remember your brother .
Well they know he exists
but
but that 's it .
yeah
you know they were never %uh
Well how do they look physically ?
Great .
Is that so ?
Absolutely great .
Some years ago Irv had a major heart attack
uh-huh .
and apparently he 's just done everything right because he said
let me think
I think he 's going to be eighty next month .
oh .
It 's either seventy - nine or eighty .
I
Eighty .
yeah
and he looks great .
She still plays tennis .
ooh that 's wonderful .
%uh I 've seen her just a couple of times through the years .
Seemed to me she was a little slimmer than I remember .
%uh you know she 's still not a thin person
but she looks good .
uh-huh .
%um you know and they were telling us what they do .
You know they live in a suburb of Minneapolis .
mhm . mhm .
And anyway
so they really look good .
And did they mention their other children ?
the oldest is a daughter named Elsa
mhm .
%uh %eh she lives in Tucson where George Miller lives .
mhm .
And she 's a nurse
and apparently she the last few years has been the head pediatric nurse at the hospital where she is .
oh .
%hm .
I know Irv was telling me that she always said she did n't want the responsibility of being in charge of anything .
mhm .
Once they put her in charge she says now she wants it
She loves it .
Well now she wants it all .
She wants to do more .
You know he was laughing about it you know .
yeah .
She 's married I presume .
oh yeah
she has a half dozen kids .
oh really ?
yeah .
oh a big family .
yeah
she
either five or six
I forget .
gee
She had a big family .
uh-huh
And her oldest is just starting college
I 'm trying to think where .
She got a scholarship I do n't know somewhere in the east
The oldest is just starting college ?
That 's Elsa 's oldest
in other words Lida and Irv 's daughter .
oh grandson
I see
that 's different uh-huh .
yeah
i-
yeah
I think it 's the granddaughter .
The granddaughter uh-huh
yeah
she
and what does her husband do
do you know ?
Elsa 's ?
Yes .
No
%uh the couple of times that I %uh went to Tucson %uh she would come you know when they would invite relatives in like their kids that live there
Yes .
uh-huh .
and they 'd always invite Elsa
one year in fact when I was there Lida and Irv were
they spend a month in Tucson every year .
mhm .
I think it 's February you know the worst of the winter .
Sure .
oh the worst of the winter right .
yeah
and %um I know I 've met her each time .
He must be some sort of a salesman because both times I think he was in Texas which is n't far you know mhm . mhm mhm . when you 're in that part of the world .
Sure
right
I know it 's close .
%um but always on business
and I remember they told me that he 's gone a lot so you know he 's in and out but that she manages very well .
mhm .
mhm . mhm
They all felt she was just a great mother you know the way she took care of her kids .
That 's wonderful
%uh you know %uh I think you learn a lot when you have such a big family
you learn how to juggle it around you know .
really .
really .
yeah .
And apparently she
%uh %eh my impression is they 're not wealthy you know
in fact I got the impression they were struggling just a little bit %uh that 's Elsa and her husband when the babies were little
Well you know the big family like that right .
yeah
and she could n't have been working very much at that point if at all .
Either
right right .
yeah .
And so probably one %uh income just you know was making it
%eh makes it hard of course .
yeah
you know .
Now is n't there another daughter
or do n't
is it another daughter or another son ?
oh
uh-huh .
And I 'm not sure either
What 's there
uh-huh .
I 've only met those two
but you 're right
there 's one other chil-
I think it seems to me another child .
%uh I 'm positive you 're right
%eh it just registered .
Right .
it seems to me they may even have said something about him
but I never met the third one
so you know mhm . mhm . it did n't stick with me whatever they said .
That was nice to see family you know %uh over the years
it 's very interesting .
mhm .
Is n't it ?
mhm .
Do you ever see Abe ?
He also lives in Ann Arbor .
He 's very sick .
oh .
He had major surgery four or five years ago
and he walked around That I remember . yeah . yeah like a walking skeleton .
mhm .
And the only time I see him now is if I call and ask them to come
mhm .
and I do n't think now that you mention it
it 's been about a year .
mhm .
Before you know when he was still quite well he would occasionally drop in mhm . because their daughter lives mhm . I think actually on the eastern part of the city .
mhm .
y-
Not in Detroit but you know
it 's not Warren
Sterling Heights
I do n't know
something like that .
yeah .
yeah
yeah .
yeah
yeah
oh
So if he was going to visit her he would you know occasionally stop in here on his way home .
Sure .
Sure .
But since he 's been ill he does n't seem to do that .
I 'm not sure that
their daughter is Linda
Yes
yes .
and I do n't know whether she got married or she 's just been living with this man for a long while
but they tell me he works at Chrysler
and he makes nice money
and they seem to have a very nice home mhm . mhm . you know .
Well that 's good .
yeah
yeah
You know considering everything I say that 's good .
mhm .
a-
So we took care of them .
yeah .
Now %uh we did n't take care of your children yet .
Well %uh I still have two in San Jose .
And you know I 'm so angry at you
you send me a card
uh-huh .
you never send me an address or a telephone number
and I do n't know where to respond .
%ah .
And I 'm left stymied
and I read it and read it
and I say why did n't she give me a telephone number
I 'd call her back .
yeah
I never even think of it .
You will next time .
yeah
now that you said it I sure will .
Sure it 's the
%uh get me a telephone number on that card so I can call you back
All right .
You go there .
You go there f- %uh
do n't you start a
Well I have n't been the-
once a year .
%um but although they 're trying to solicit more throughout the globe instead of just Japan
mhm .
although they 've had most interest in Japan .
mhm .
And I teach probably two classes and then do administrative work to make connections for these people to have tours or to go look at companies dealing with certain issues that they 're working on in their classes .
Half of their classes are business half are English business
mhm
mhm .
mhm .
mhm
So it 's really groovy because I mean I have all these contacts for them because of my experience in the business world here .
yeah .
yeah .
you know and I do a little teaching for them too .
okay .
What classes did you teach at that would be related ?
I taught business English .
uh-huh .
I taught listening .
I taught integrated skills and beginning grammar .
okay .
mhm .
I 'm just writing this down so Cool . You do n't have to tell them about or anything .
oh weird .
You know what ?
What ?
I had a dream this morning about ,
it 's weird .
I do n't know if you were in it .
I think you were .
%huh .
But Barry was definitely in it .
yeah .
And Barry and I
I do n't know .
We were trying to get somewhere
and we had to jump in this water
but she would n't let go of me when we got in the water
and I woke up because I start drowning .
I do n't know what that means .
I got a postcard from her too the other day
yeah . That 's a scary dream .
It was pretty scary .
yeah .
I do n't know
it was kind of one of those frustrating type dreams .
%eh w-
listen .
Was it difficult going back to the U S ?
yeah .
yeah .
It was harder than I thought it would be actually .
yeah .
%um harder in the sense that %uh I was n't used to the pace
mhm . you know the pace is totally different .
mhm .
%um
And I did n't really want to see anybody for a while .
and I did n't , which was fine .
And I really missed people %um from Poland because it was all my support system .
Coming here the only person that really knew and understood my circumstances was Tom .
mhm .
And so that was really tough because that was a lot of pressure on both of us coming with him again and all of that .
mhm .
%um readjusting as far as Americanisms
mhm .
%uh Blimpie 's scared me .
Blimpie 's is the sandwich place
I know .
I know .
oh that 's pretty funny .
We went in there
and it was so yellow .
It was just so yellow
and they wanted to help so bad .
%ah .
And it was
%ah
I just went back
and I decided people are a bit too cheery in the U S .
oh yeah .
oh yeah .
And see that wanting to help you so bad just freaked me out .
oh my God .
like , I just like ran into stores and ran out because
uh-huh .
I 'd go on the weekdays you know because Right . you know I had time off
and %um uh-huh . I 'd walk in there
and like five people would say hello to me .
I 'd be just like leave me alone .
oh my God . It 's just very hard .
I talked to Kristen though when I was home .
yeah ?
yeah .
She seems to be doing well .
She 's working which is good
and %um she 's healthy again .
That 's good .
%hm yeah .
I 'd like to be healthy again .
yeah .
I hope
hey . you know I was going to tell you this thing that I got .
Tom found this for me about this freebie experiment thing where you can do this and you can talk .
uh-huh .
yeah .
And it was funny because he handed it to me
and I was really confused
and I said well is this somebody that contacted you on your email or what ?
He goes no I told you about this last week blah , blah , blah .
I 'm looking at it because it had this guy his name is Mark Yalinsky .
and it was his email thing
and it said U N I Lodz Poland .
You told me .
And I 'm like
And it was a Playboy joke on this thing .
It was done as an example of what we do .
And it was from Lodz .
And I 'm like did somebody try to get a hold of you
and he goes no .
I go well there 's this thing .
I said look at this
and it you know is all in code .
uh-huh .
And he goes ooh weird .
He goes I did n't do that .
That 's really funny .
yeah .
Small world %huh ?
You 're
yeah .
And now are you not smoking ?
No .
I am smoking .
yeah .
Well I did a few when I 've been back too .
yeah .
I 've been smoking big time .
It 's been a rough couple months .
yeah ?
Well yeah
it 's been really busy .
The kid sister thing ?
%huh ?
The kid sister thing ?
Well no .
Not really that
but it 's been really busy as far as work is concerned .
Sure .
yeah .
You know ?
Now things are just like kind of mellow
and I 'm just you know wrapping things up
so it 's not that bad .
Sure .
mhm .
But it was kind of hellish for a bit .
yeah .
oh I 'm sure .
I still ,
all I want to do is sleep now .
I 've been trying to nap for the longest time today .
Every time I lay down a phone rings and like random people call me .
You 're not that random
but it 's kind of random receiving a phone call from you .
**Eee**.
I mean you 're not a random person
but
Well thank you .
I appreciate being considered %er non random .
No .
You 're pretty organized and orderly .
Thank you .
you 're random
No problem .
Jody 's going to be shocked that I heard from you .
She what ?
She 's going to be happy that I heard
oh yeah .
Did you get her postcard ?
I have n't heard
%hm from her ?
yeah .
No %huh I have n't heard from her at all .
She sent you a postcard .
In fact we both sent you postcards .
%ah .
All right .
yeah .
You know what ?
What ?
I just came back from the U S
and I have some letters for you including that little package .
I do n't know what to do with that little package .

uh-huh .
And %um I do n't know
Well I think ,
no you know what I think you should do .
Dorota please .
Really .
%uh .
The package of henna , share it with Magda .
Magda is gone
so maybe I 'll do it in my hair .
okay .
It 's a nice brown .
oh is it ?
Good , good .
yeah .
Well a friend of mine from Florida sent that to me .
%eh yeah .
She 's from Gainesville
Gainesville Florida . mhm .
yeah
And
yeah
so I would like to think that it goes to a good
because sending it back to me would probably just be ludicrous
so you know why do n't you just
So I can keep it .
I 'm opening it up right now as you speak so I can put a world peace stamp on it .
uh-huh .
All right .
All right .
You know what ?
I 've been saying all right all the time now .
I went to this conference in the U S
and they 're like where did you get that
Great . I 'm like %uh that 's a really long story .
See there was this volunteer
and she used to know this old man because she used to work
and this man would just sit there and say all right .
I have another one though too
and Tom was really getting sick of it .
What was it ?
.
I 'll have to think of it .
it 's another one of those %uh all right
**Yuh**
because he says what does that mean when I say it now .
It 's like %uh I need to know more information .
Just hearing all right is n't enough okay ?
aw all right .
It 's like catchy man .
It is .
And you know
I ca n't stop myself from saying it yet .
yeah .
So %um
but anyway I want to come visit you .
When
When ?
Next summer .

Well I mean your job goes through when
July , June of next year ?
yeah .
I was hoping to be out of here before July .
mhm .
Do you ,
okay .
okay
Because I really would kind of like to get there before you 're gone before Jody is gone , go to Warsaw one more time . mhm . That kind of thing .
Well Jody might have a job offer in Budapest .
oh that 's right .
She was looking at that .
Is n't that crazy ?
That 's wild .
yeah .
I mean if it 's June then that would be fine .
But then you might come back to the states or something .
When ?
Maybe .
I do n't know .
When you 're done .
oh soon .

Listen .
What 's the time difference between here and like Houston ?
Is that a random question ?
Houston I think is still like my time , like seven hours .
Seven hours .
All right .
I believe so .

and I 'll look and see .
Anyway .
So how 's the weather ?
You know it 's really nice .
mhm .
It 's not as ,
how 's the weather over there ?
How come people are dying in Chicago , %huh ?
It 's because of bad administrative things
and people do n't have any air and electricity
and they 're dying of the heat .
Is n't that
We had a heat wave here for about a week and a half that was ,
in Nebraska we had one day a hundred and fifteen degrees .
You 're joking .

yeah .
What was it
two hundred and something .
Well it 's up to four hundred and sixty or something .

But that 's a lot .
oh yeah .
For something like that , there 's no reason .
yeah

what she was aiming to is to get to the %uh Israeli teachers ' organization so she could speak more about her book
and then she has got another one that she is writing now .
Is n't she something .
You see she wrote the one
and it 's been really a success
and -- Wonderful . -- yeah , she spoke to them
and the ministry of education has approved it so it will be available if
what is the name of the title of the book .
it 's world folklore .
I 'll send you a pamphlet

yeah
that 's it .
So it will be available .
They 've had a hard time somehow getting it across because it comes through Cypress
you know there are all kinds Yes -- -- of drayluch that evolved
-- but is n't she wonderful really --
Well I 'll tell you
-- she 's really remarkable .
She has done such wonderful work , Ida . --
Listen
-- you must be very proud of her .
let me tell you
the book has been %uh taken to China
but you know there 's a problem because they do a lot of copying
they do n't want to spend the money .
%uh , I know .
So the book is in China
and it 's in Japan
and it 's in Germany
and %uh that is what her publisher and editor are trying to do is get it through the Los Angeles school district which is a mine you know with all the foreign people here --
Yes of course .
-- and %uh there 's a woman who 's heading the purchases of book at
she teaches at Columbia University
but she handles the purchases of the book in New York City %uh city schools --
Is n't that amazing ?
-- so she 's working on it
and you see Anita has been running around to so many conventions
in fact in October she 's going to another convention in Buffalo .
She 's been to Savannah
and she 's been to %uh -- Yes . -- South Carolina
and she 's been %uh --
Gosh
-- I ca n't begin to name all the places .
it 's remarkable .
I 'm telling you Ida
it 's breathtaking .
You see
It 's just wonderful .
It 's so exciting .
that 's it .
You see it --
It 's really remarkable .
I 'm telling you
it 's -- it e- yeah -- really remarkable .
It 's remarkable . and this came from -- What she has done .
-- this came from an essay that she had written for her Masters here .
You know she has a second Masters in English as -- I know . -- a second language .
%ah
So it became a book
Is it th-
that 's so wonderful .
And the boys ?
It is exciting .
uch , it 's exciting is not the word .
It 's really wonderful .
It 's such a happy news , you know ?
Well , it 's different .
We had such hard time here this morning .
We had such a difficult time here this morning .
It 's different .
I can imagine .
I can imagine .
I read the paper and heard the news .
Jerusalem
oh th-
you know it .
It is so devastating
I ca n't begin to tell you .
A hundred people are wounded and seven dead .
Yes yes .
%uh , you see .
oh Ida it 's just unbelievable .
how long can this go on ?
I do n't know .
you know we
it 's such a feeling of helplessness .
Everybody is in danger .
It 's a whole country that 's you know
but %eh %eh
Everyone is in danger
I do n't care where you are -- Everyone Ida -- because you do not know what they 're going to throw and what they 're going to do .
Everyone
Well as long as somebody is willing to blow himself up it makes it very difficult .
Well and they are willing to do it .
But it 's so terribly sad .
They 're willing to do it .
It 's so sad Ida .
It is so -- -- unbelievably sad .
Well , has n't it divided the country ?
263.85_264.42_A: Are n't there --
I do n't know .
Look
I -- -- pro and against ? -- do n't know .
We have to do something .
No
I do n't know if it has really .
I 'm not sure .
Because I feel that the people would like to seal off the Arab countries from Gaza , for example and just not let them come in anymore and let them do whatever they have to do .
the
Look
they should also be able to do -- Yes but you 've got -- and determine their own futures .
But you see you 've got a religious element both here in America and in Israel -- -- who refuse to give up -- But Gaza is not the -- g- -- any of the holy land .
yeah ,
but not Gaza .
not Gaza .
Not Gaza .
Not Gaza
but the %uh
Gaza does n't come under this thing .
yeah
but the %uh West Bank and so on
yeah
we did n't get to that yet .
We 're not finished with Gaza .
We 've got no end .
we do n't know where to run first , you know ?
It 's like a fire .
So sad .
uch , it 's so sad .
It is very devastating every day to get up and hear of another blast .
It 's very devastating .
yeah .
It 's terrible .
And you know I get up early .
I got up at five .
So I get the news very early . Because I bring in the -- yeah the bad news . -- paper and hear the radio and it 's --
That 's terrible .
I 'm just worried how long this can go on . Because , you see , Rabin is having a hell of a time to satisfy the elements . You know .
Well he has to continue .
Well of course .
%uh , there 's no choice .
He must continue what he started .
yeah .
You see Grace , this goes -- No . -- back to nineteen sixty seven after the six day war .
Right .
I was teaching Pinchas Sapir English at the Kiriyah
Right .
and I had some very interesting discussions with him back -- mhm . -- then when I said to him we 've go to settle with the Arabs before they get strong
and he laughed at me .
I said some day you 'll know what I have said .
Yes .
This should be settled because the longer you wait the stronger they become .
It should have been settled in nineteen sixty seven .
We should have given it back right then and there .
And get it over with .
yeah
because
But you see
Well I 'm very mad with Golda because she refused to do it .
But you see the whole thing was we 're proud
we showed them we could defeat them
and so therefore why should we talk to them
they 're the underdog now .
And so I will never forget what some of the girls said to me in seminar Levinsky -- oh it 's too terrible . -- when I brought up the issue
they were ready to choke me
they said what do you mean
they were ready to throw us into the sea
now we can throw them into the sea .
Well yeah . I still remember those discussions
and I said from the beginning this is wrong .
Well , this is what 's happened .
Of course it 's wrong .
You see nations make mistakes .
tough luck
they did n't like us anyway .
%eh %eh the best news is Iraq .
Well that the world can at least see something I do n't know yet what will be with Iraq .
You never know ,
you never know the game .
Well You never know
but there is a well ,
but the response of the world should be very strong against him .
Now Grace are you looking for justice ?
I do n't know where justice exists .
No
I 'm not looking for justice .
I 'm looking for an end to these hostilities .
Well if you look at justice , you would think -- That 's all . -- that Iraq should 've been killed a long time ago .
But I 've given up on justice .
I do n't know where justice exists anymore .
yeah ,
but I want to tell you something Ida .
The average person on the street like you and me one day he 's got to prevail
he just simply has to .
I can assure you that those Arab women feel the same thing about their sons that we feel about ours .
Of course . Of course .
There 's no question .
And one day the people will have enough of it .
I believe in the people Ida .
Of course .
I really do .
Of course . Of course .
I do n't believe in justice
but I believe in the common man .
He 'll have it up to his eyelashes
and he wo n't be able to stand it anymore .
But
Well , that takes
Oklahoma , what do you need it for ?
Kennedy airport was closed for hours the day that I left .
mhm .
I mean I left through Boston .
uh-huh .
I came to Zurich
and I must tell you
congratulations to the Swiss .
They took out all the suitcases of the continuing passengers -- yeah . -- and put them in rooms .
And it 's only the Swiss who got my two suitcases together .
%hm .
no other people I do n't think would have been so orderly and so efficient .
%mm .
You know they would 've had one here
and you have to look for the other one .
over there .
I know .
I know .
it was wonderful .
Well the Swiss you know are orderly .
They 're really wonderful .
You know that .
And then when I came home Ida my daughter met me at the airport -- How did you uh-huh . -- with her little girl .
uh-huh .
And the little girl had said to her mother mother maybe Savta will have her face fixed
and we wo n't recognize her .
And she 's eight years old you know .
Is n't that marvelous ?
How do you like that .
yeah I -- you nee- -- should have done it .
I should have done it .
Listen .
But I did n't .
Grace is this so common in Israel , to have these facials ?
I beg your pardon .
Is it so common in Israel to have -- Ida -- -- facials ?
-- it 's not that common ,
no .
No it is n't .
But sometimes
Here it 's very common .
You
yeah
Do n't forget Beverly Hills .
This is the beauty center .
yeah
right ,
yeah .
I should have come to you
That 's what I should have done .
You know I had a student
You better give me your phone number because I do n't have the right number .
Please take it .
yeah .
Do you have a pencil ?
yeah ,
yeah .
I 'm writing .
it 's three one zero
yeah .
two seven seven
two seven seven
one eight two six
one eight two six .
You 've made this a very happy day for me , I must tell you Ida -- Listen you sound -- a very very happy day .
But listen Grace
you sound hoarse .
Do you have a cold ?
Well no
you know Ida I 've had this terrib-
It 's the old story .
It 's the old story
but it 's been much better because I have used a Ventalin of late , -- -- for the past week .
But you know %uh the problem with these is %uh %uh
What is it
a spray ?
Ventalin is a spray .
The problem with the-
What 's it called ?
What 's it called
because I use one too ?
It 's Ventalin .
It 's called Ventalin
and it has
Yes ,
very powerful .
It stopped me from coughing for a whole week .
Who gave it to you ,
an allergist ?
the doctor gave it to me .
But the problem with this stuff is Ida that after a while your body gets used to it ,
you see ?
And it did n't work .
it 's not really working the way it should .
I have to go back to the doctor and get a-
Well you know I also use a spray because I have asthma .
Well I think that 's what I 've got -- And , %uh -- too .
I do have asthma .
And then this spray has been really effect-
what do you use , Ida ,
Betrafort ?
It 's called Airobid .
uh-huh .
yeah ,
well I thi-
I used Evancerol
and %uh what it did it made my voice so hoarse I was embarrassed when I spoke .
So I went here to the pulmonary department at U C L A , you know , at the university -- Yes . -- and got the top man there .
A great guy .
Yes .
And he changed me to the Airobid
and I 'm very happy with it .
Yes .
First of all
Well I
%uh %uh that 's the only relief I 've gotten really in fifteen years , believe it or not , -- uh-huh . -- was from this Ventalin .
But I see that i-
It 's a very powerful one .
They wo n't let me use it because of my fibrillation of the heart .
So I ca n't use the Ventalin .
yeah .
Well yeah
but it
But it 's an old medication .
Listen
before I forget I want to ask you again the name
Yes .
I want to make sure
I want to read this number to you again .
Yes .
yeah .
right now .
it 's two seven seven
three one eight
one eight two six
I 'd
I mean I guess it just totally makes sense that they do because that 's just not something I think of Iranians doing is making films .
Gassing Kurds and shooting Iraqis
yeah
that makes sense that they do that .
Well , that 's a different kind of Iranians , I imagine .
Which I think Nassir 's more Persian
but it 's the same area
then it became Iran later .
Meanwhile , back at the ranch
I thought about that the other day .
%ha I use that all the time , still .
It 's kind of amusing .
Things never change .
Yes , they do
Regardless
So what 's happening with you and Sharon ?
Well , we are here in Italy . mhm In Villa Verla which is this little , basically nowhere town about half an hour from post .
and %uh it 's gorgeous .
I look out the window .
I look at the Alps %um
Everywhere you look it 's just like little red tiled roofs just like you see in the postcards and the picture books .
uh-huh
it 's awesome .
It 's amazing .
%um so we live here in this third floor apartment going to work every day and then coming home .
On the weekends , we try and get out and go places see the country .
Getting a little more difficult as of late .
We 're kind of busy over here as I 'm sure you
it 's all in the news
%uh %uh right Though
well anyway we 're busy .
Let me put it that way .
okay
%uh yeah
it 's fun good
That 's nice .
It sure is weird hearing your voice .
yeah
it 's been a while .
I 'll tell you that .
yeah
about a year and a half .
yeah
something like that .
Something like that .
You
does your email
I mean are you getting the emails ?
I think you are
I mean you responded okay .
yeah mhm .
Usually whenever I get a message I respond in some way or other
sorry
you know me
but yeah
you know my mom finally got email
oh really ?
yeah
What 's her email address ?
oh I do n't remember off hand .
That 's okay .
You can send it to me later .
you want my mom 's email address ?
yeah
I 'll write your mom
okay
I write everybody .
that 's funny
yeah well .
one of her students showed her
well it 's funny enough that she finally got email after I 've been telling her for years to do it .
right
and now she has this big push that everybody needs to get it
right
hello , mom .
thanks mom .
thanks for the tip .
and one of her students showed her how to get into the X five hundred directories
which are
which
%hm ?
what are the X five hundred directories ?
oh %um where you put your %um
how can you not know ?
address sometimes
and then she can put like favorite beverage some other little information ,
%mm where did you travel
oh it 's like your finger file kind of thing ?
%mm no
it 's different
but sort of like that .
okay .
%um and for my favorite beverage I put down of course almond tea with honey and milk
mhm
and so she read that because that was what was there
and when she sent me a message She wrote that and wrote big mama 's watching .
And ever since , everything she signs from me is love big mama .
what 's she doing nowadays ?
Just out of curiosity .
%um she 's teaching computer science at Wright State
okay .
Computer Science .
yeah
I mean she was doing math and computer science
but right now she 's just doing computer science .
Mostly applications %um not any real computer stuff the hard stuff , the programming
but
yeah
This is how you do M S Word ,
this is how you do a spreadsheet whatever
Important
yup
So what 's it like living in a co-op
good .
Actually , I 'm the president .
Are you really ?
What i-
now do n't co-ops have like a particular theme
or is it the
No ,
this is just a living co-op
okay
I live well
a lot of the co-ops in general are houses .
This is more of an apartment style co-op
mhm
That 's sort of a cross between a dorm and like a house
okay
I mean the room it 's very dorm like in terms of the room ,
like you have a room ,
but on the other hand %um right well it 's mostly graduate students
so That feels different
but no
in that way I mean it 's really nice to come home and have dinner ready
right
Like a nice dinner every night , cooked specially
There 's a chef who takes care of things during the week .
oh that 's all right
There 's
and he plans meals
and people here put in three hour work shifts and prepare it
but decides what it 's going to be . You know
and she 'll come to clean the bathroom every week you know -- Right -- deal with the mundane things that I do n't handle well -- yeah -- you know on a regular basis when I start feeling overloaded although I have n't
it 's so much easier than undergrad for me .
I 'm sorry
It could n't have been much more difficult .
I 'm pretty much just taking it easy .
that 's cool
Studying a bit here .
Going out and doing stuff
Watching Iranian films
I 'm not watching them .
Nassir is
oh you 're not going to watch Iranian films ? No . I 'm going to see my friend , Molly and some other Earlham friends .
%ah
I
Well I 'm sort of disappointed
I wanted you to tell me what Iranian film was like
but you can ask Nassir .
Actually this week he told me %um it 's a movie about this woman who I think was a nurse and actually did a lot of work and did a lot of good stuff
but then when she got married her mother - in - law is very traditional
and so she stopped working because it was making her husband unhappy
right
and then there was %um some kind of disaster that had happened a plague or something I think
and so she brought her skills back out into the open and cures people and does really good things
and so it gets into %um some of the problems of traditional society and roles of women sort of pro-feminist kind of stuff
Sounded neat to me .
It 's one I would watch
yeah
cool
Last film I watched was Star Wars
Bought it on video tape .
Twelve ninety - five .
Pretty cool .
yeah .
Well wh-
Not exactly deep culture , though .
, well , it 's very cultural .
It is yeah very pop culture
Pop culture
Well you know why they re-released them for the last time , right ?
yeah
because they 're coming out with the new ones .
Well not only that .
They 're redoing parts of the old ones .
I guess I 'd heard something about they 're going to do like computer graphics or something like that .
I do n't know .
They 're redoing parts of it I think to help fit in with the new one .
And so that way they get two major sales of the three video tapes
Seems like a pretty good deal to me .
I 'll buy them .
I 'll help .
I 'll support that part of the economy
Support your culture
Your taxpayers ' dollars at work
Star Wars
yeah
all three of them twice
yeah
I watched you know five days of them .
I do n't need to go out of the house
Why leave ?
I do n't know .
Get a case of beer an-
Rebecca
Sharon says hi
I say hi
hungry
say again
Do you want food ?
No I just ate
remember
yeah
I ate at the Burger King
Some things do n't change
No
I 'll tell you
is n't that sad ?
I 'm here in Italy
and I ate Burger King for lunch .
I ca n't say I 'm much better .
I had Lucky Charms for breakfast
That 's awesome
I 'd never had them I mean before the last like few weeks
and I tried them
and they 're interesting
Interesting I think is the only word that I would use to describe Lucky Charms
I mean I do n't know
I 've never really tried fruit cereals
and it 's a whole new adventure .
you should try %uh Captain Crunch
ooh I actually did try that .
It 's **icky**
yeah
it is **icky**
It 's pure sugar and **ick** sugar and **ick**
I ca n't eat that stuff
I 'm getting old , Rebecca
oh
I 'm an old man
No ,
you 're younger than I am
I creak when I get out of bed in the morning
ooh my knees crack .
That 's the thing that bothers me .
yeah
anyway What are tho-
okay the big question .
okay .
are you going to be back in this country any time ?
whew no time soon
Just though you might come home for Christmas or something .
Nope ,
not a chance .
%mm
we have what 's called a I R F which is the Initial Reaction Force
Turns out that the battalion I 'm in is the only American airborne in fact the only light forces i.e. we do n't have big tanks and shit in Europe .
And so if anything really really bad happens they will deploy us first because we 're easy to move .
yeah ,
I 'd deploy you .
You 're easy .
and %uh I 've always said that
I know it .
%uh So we rotate responsibility in the battalion on who 's on basically a four hour alert .
Need to be there with all your gear in four hours
and during Christmas , I 'll be on it .
So I ai n't going nowhere .
%ah
oh well
You know one of these day-
Should come to Italy
Yes I should , in fact .
When I have money again .
I 've been spending more than I ever have before lately .
Probably have more than you 've ever had before lately .
Well yeah .
yeah .
there you go .
oh I got your %um message today .
I wrote you back .
I do n't know if you checked it or not .
%um I was there in the afternoon .
%mm .
%um which message ?
yeah
yeah
you did
oh about the prayers like
yeah
yeah
did you get that one ?
mhm .
okay .
edit
so you did n't get my answer ?
oh no
no
I wrote you back .
I answered you back oh he is at another time because I read your message
oh great
she says something totally opposite of what the other person said
what am I going to do .
So I just wrote this long drawn out thing on the net
and I was like
complaining about all the different versions of every rule that you ever hear .
No
%um I got kind of personal with it because I always like start off you know
and he 'd answer , bah bah bah ,
and then I 'd just end up like talking about myself like you know because I know people are wondering oh why does she want to know how you make up a prayer you know Well I mean it happens to everybody . and all that other stuff
yeah
but some people are on this like kick that you know you 're not supposed to ask stuff like that you know like what Dalia will post on the net .
I bet some people are freaking out over that
and I think that 's perfectly natural to want to know , you know , stuff like that ?
yeah
I mean that was the purpose of this net .
yeah
but some people like
%um I do n't know if you were on %um last year when %um Jemilla
No I just started .
yeah
there was this big thing %um last year
and I took myself off because I did n't want to deal with it .
This %um sister she wrote about %uh this like cookie dough thing you know one of those like sexually perverted kind of jokey kind of postings things
and so everyone was so offended
and like you know a lot of people arguing back and forth .
They got really petty
and mhm . it happens a lot you know ?
It happens a lot .
Stuff gets you know taken out of context
and people get offended and stuff like that .
yeah
and plus because your 're dealing with so many completely different kinds of people .
I did n't really realize that though .
I thought it was I %eh
this is a really diverse network .
I did n't know there was so many people .
yeah
so people where getting mad at Delila 's though ?
I mean just read in the post
people are like you know
All right
I mean not today 's ?
no not today for- okay but before
yeah .
yeah .
yeah ,
you know I 'm supposed to meet her next week ?
Really ,
she lives in Michigan ?
No she lives in Chicago .
oh .
But I 'm going up to Chicago because there 's %um this Sufi conference
oh
and %um I 'm going to stay with her until %uh
oh that 's great .
I ca n't wait .
yeah ,
should be fun
Because I have not left my
well I mean I was in Germany for one year
and then I came back from Germany last fall
mhm .
and then I have not been anywhere except for my house and school since then oh . and like the road in between
it 's like I got to get out .
yeah
that 's good
so how long is the conference ?
It 's just for one day .
oh
And it 's free .
That 's the best thing about it .
It 's free ?
yeah .
Wow .
yeah .
You just have to find the means to get there , right ?
for some reason I
yeah ,
I am going to take the train , I think .
oh .
%mm So you 're still going to go to the
yeah ,
I want to actually a little
I mean %eh Robin already like paid for everything
so I feel really bad if I do n't go
and I think he 's kind of counting on me to go too
so yeah . I 'm just going to go .
all I have to do is find a way to get there which I have n't found yet
and it 's really
oh really ?
yeah
it 's coming up really soon .
Because I thought you got
I do n't think I 'll take a plane there
but %uh I do n't know ,
a bus or a train or something .
oh
because I mean if you got here you could probably ride with Robin .
yeah ,
I was thinking of that too
but I do n't even
But that will probably cost the same just to come here as
yeah .
I brought
like she said she was driving alone
so I would n't mind
like I even said to her you know I 'll come there
and then I can drive with you .
yeah
actually I kind of probably
I mean , is she driving there by herself ?
yeah .
yeah
because I mean I think she 's okay right now
but it would be much better if she did n't have to drive by herself .
yeah ,
I think so too
you know I want to do that
but I think she does n't want me to go through all that trouble
yeah .
but I told her it 's no big deal .
I figure take the bus or the train there and then we can drive down together you know .
yeah ,
I mean I think that would be nice .
I mean and also because it is nice like if you are going to a big place not to go along yeah because who knows how hard it 'll be to find somebody once you 're there
right
and I 'll be alone
I wo n't know anything .
yeah .
And she 's been here before like to the conference
but I do n't know if she 's been to Ohio , right ?
yeah .
yeah
It 's in Columbus ?
yeah ,
and also I 'm kind of worried about her because like you d-
I do n't know if she talked to you about her health
yeah ,
she has .
yeah
%eh yeah
yeah
because there 's
I mean a few weeks ago she was like losing control of her hand
and %uh now she 's on some kind of medication that 's like put it back
like she can use her hands again
mhm .
But like she had to have her hand bandaged up and stuff
and like she was having a real hard time at work
so that would me nervous like if she was going to drive by herself you know
like what happens you know if something **cooky** goes wrong with her hand and she ca n't drive
but I guess she 's taking some medication now
so I guess it 's okay
but
%hm .
yeah ,
I tried calling her tonight
but I got her answering machine
so I left her a message to her
%hm
She calls me back I 'll tell her that 's what I 'll do because I was thinking about that too
but you know she like throws it off make it seems like it 's no big deal
and I think oh well
but %um
well just tell her that you 'd prefer her company or something
then it wo n't be like you know she does n't want to put you out for %um you know inconvenience
but if you make it sound like you want to do it then she 'll probably agree .
yeah
yeah .
So you still are not thinking of going , right ?
No , I think not .
yeah .
yeah ,
I mean because even before all that weird stuff you know I 've been talking about I 've always like had a kind of weird feeling about them anyway .
I mean the whole organization just because I do n't know it seems kind of strange
like %um I do n't know
it 's hard to explain
but just real %um
Like someone me today
and you know she said you know we should really go to a conference you know as a group because I 'll be living with like four or five sisters this fall who rented a place
yeah .
and so she said %um you know it would be nice if we could go to a conference
but it would have to be all females because she hears that some of them are meat markets
so I 've heard other th-
oh really .
yeah .
And I was like whoa you know I did n't even think of that
but it 's kind of true .
A lot of %eh People looking for a eligible women right yeah in one place
but I do n't know
I do n't know
%mm
If I hate the experience then I 'll never go to another one
but if it turns out to be okay then you know it 's okay
yeah .
I mean I heard I mean that it is enjoyable you know
people talk about you know religious things and get really into it and stuff
yeah .
%um I guess that what I had heard bad about it was just that they were so into talking about like %um the Koran and stuff but that they were n't using this as being like a tool for social change at all like they were n't talking about what we could possibly do %mm . As Muslims to like improve the world but rather well just spend all your time praying kind of philosophy .
oh .
And %um so e-
Nine thousand people and that 's it , %huh ?
%huh ?
I said nine thousand people and that 's all they find to do with that
you know they have like %uh %uh a large group of people ,
they could really make a difference
but they
I do n't know
I have n't been to one
so I d-
yeah
yeah
I have n't been to it either
so I ca n't really talk .
%mm
But ,
yeah ,
I think that they just do n't want to get really radical Right . I mean because I guess like Saudi Arabia funds it a lot
and %um
yeah ,
they were talking about Azum
is that the person 's name Azarahim
I 've never heard of like this person
yeah ,
I 've never heard of him either .
and they said that he 's a murderer and stuff like that .
yeah .
I do n't know .
And then there 's the Mike Tyson thing that a lot of us have
not too you know happy about that .
yeah
And %uh
Well , it will be interesting to see what he has to say .
yeah
Did you read my post like what I wrote about him and stuff like
That he was talking about his girlfriend or something .
yeah ,
he 's talking about well I ca n't even kiss my girlfriend
and I was like no you do n't do that to your girlfriend ,
what is that .
So it 's like he does n't really know
I do n't know .
he does n't even have the basics down you know
like like we were at the beginning stage
like I have the basics down
and that 's it
but he does n't even have that
like I mean there was no like girlfriend boyfriend thing you know , and other stuff .
No pork any of that stuff
but it 's like he 's just you know yeah I out of it .
He does n't have control over his life .
That 's what I think
and so you know when people rag on him I tend to take like the side of you know like Mike Tyson because he really does n't know .
I mean he knew what he did
but it 's not all him , you know .
Other people control him and tell him what to do and where to spend his money and stuff like that .
yeah
I mean I generally just stay away from the T V anyway .
yeah ,
I 'm a T V magnet .
So I never know about these things except for when people talk about it
I 'm a T V magnet .
So %um I forgot what you did ,
you 're a grad student , right ?
No , actually I 'm the %uh eternal bachelor 's student .
You 're a what ?
A bachelor 's or undergrad or whatever you call it ?
oh really .
yeah .
What year are you ?
Working on
I think this is my fifth year .
oh really .
oh that 's not bad .
I 'll be a fifth year .
I mean I wo n't be one next year
but it 's going to get to that point
I ca n't finish my major in three years .
I 'm going to need three because my first two years I ca n't tell you what I did with those
yeah
So %uh it 's like I 'm in the same boat too .
yeah ,
what do you ma-
But you 've already graduated though , right ?
What ?
You 've already graduated , right ?
No ,
see I 'm working on like three degrees at one time
so it 's going to be another three years before I graduate . oh . Unless I just decide to give up and just take what I 've got .
So what do you have so far ?
or do you
Well right now if I
I could graduate with a German degree right now
mhm .
but German degree is useless . Right . Unless you get a P h D or something .
mhm .
So , I 'm also working on an English degree because that 's my real interest .
You really
English literature , right ?
yeah
well what I really really love is like medieval stuff
oh wow .
and that 's why I really think that like English and German goes together really well if you 're interested in medieval %mm . because %um in the past English and German used to be the same language like before the year seven hundred .
Wow .
You know , because like in Europe it was all like wandering pagan tribes and you know they came down the Goths and all them
mhm .
like I mean they spoke Germanic language
and some of them settled in Germany
and some people kept on walking and kept on going to England
and so the language gradually changed after that
Wow .
They 're very dusty honey
I could n't believe how many sweaters you have
like oh my god you could open a secondhand shop for like thirty sweaters
it 's
oh my god
yeah
we have a lot of %um very crappy sweaters
I mean a lot of it looked like
yeah
yeah
I was thinking to my-
well I would n't keep this
I know
I know
Thank you so much
I ca n't believe that you 're doing all that
and then she washed like all the dishes that were on the shelves
like so when you come back at least you know you have some oh my god Clean dishes and something you can wear and %um
oh I feel so bad you know
it 's like I do n't feel so bad about you because I do n't feel like you 're so traumatized
but I feel so bad about Tamara because I feel like she was sort of truly traumatized you know by the whole thing
and I do n't
yeah
but it 's okay I mean
I mean
yeah
yeah
she 's really sweet
I mean after she went in and %eh saw the fleas she never went back in there
she always sent me in
she sent you in
have you been watering the plants by the way like along the way because I know that she never went in anymore
I watered them like once %um before I bombed the f- the first time
yeah
okay
good
great
and now again
but they look okay
yeah
okay
okay
great
because like %um at the point where that happened I was wondering if like Tamara like got so shocked by the whole thing that she just like did n't you know think to tell you that she had n't been watering the plants because I knew that she was n't going in there you know yeah and stuff
so
yeah
No ,
but really they 're definitely gone now
oh boy
I mean Tamara is still like you know
but you know there still can be a mutation
You 're a big spoil
you know there are mutations you know
and
who was saying that
oh
Tamara
Poor poor girl
She 's totally
yeah
well as soon as Lilly
but Tamara
come on
I mean
yeah
but
as soon as Lilly is back in the apartment they 'll go on her
and if we keep
%um did you tell me about the stuff that you rub into them and the fleas die
yeah
but you do n't need that
you do n't have to give that to Lilly anymore if the fleas are gone
yeah
the fleas are gone
I do n't think it 's so good for her you know yeah i- because it really goes into the blood you know
yeah
yeah
But %um if you let her out again
I mean I have
yeah
then it can happen again
but you know you can %uh put a flea collar collar around her you know
right
right
I 'm going to do that
I 'm sure you know I actually have one here still I felt we 've never had a flea in that apartment which is
you know it must have started with one little fucking flea you know
%uh it 's really bizarre the whole story how it got in there
you know it 's like the thing
like I was horrified when Kristen told me
and I was even getting mad
and I was like saying like did n't you ever clean the place . you know
and apparently it does n't have anything to do with that No like if the place is clean or not you know
No
and my sister Lisa said that her house has been infested %um several times with fleas while they were living in it just because of the dog you know
and %um the dog was always running around outside
and you know the place gets completely %um infested
and she had to bomb while they were living there
and what they did was they bombed everything but the kitchen you know
mhm
and then %um like they put down a plastic thing over the dining room table and things like that
and you know it 's like
and you just lived in the poison afterwards
and she said well yeah you know
%um that 's
yeah
well I mean all you can do is like just wash everything do a Spring clean when you get that
yeah
yeah
yeah
Well when I get back you know I mean if Tamara washed the plates that 's very nice
but I 'm going to take them all out
and then I 'm going to wash down that %um you know that thing
and %uh I 'm supposed to be speaking native English .
Well she did that
she did that
the kitchen shelf the white one
though she did n't get everything out of the cupboard
and
I mean you still have to do that .
yeah
the white
no
I do n't think you have to do that really
I mean we do n't use those
You know we noticed afterwards that the door was a little bit open you know one of the doors
so
yeah
so that 's okay
but %um I think the only thing that 's in there are glasses
we wash the glasses
yeah
yeah
but that 's so sweet of her
I ca n't believe she did that
oh god I feel horrible
No
it 's okay
yeah
thank you so much
thank you so much
you 're welcome
You know it 's %um
You owe us a nice dinner .
Yes ,
I know
definitely .
a real feast .
A total feast ,
yeah
oh Christian 's really looking forward to coming back .
he 's like %um mhm getting a little bit tired of being here because like it 's so hard to %um break into the scene
like there 's so many musicians here that even if you go to like a session and you play really good and people see that you 're playing good and turn their heads and stuff like that , nobody comes up to him and asks him who he is -- yeah -- because they do n't want to know anybody new you know
it 's like they do n't want any more competition
and he 's like
yeah
You know , he was going to a lot of sessions for a while in Harlem and stuff like that
and then he kind of just got fed up and stopped
and he 's been practicing at home
%mm
but he 's about ready to come back , you know .
And I could stay here longer , definitely .
Yes ,
yes
I love being here
I love being here .
yeah
You know I do really good %um just being here
it 's a-
you know I think I do want to spend a longer period of time in New York again .
mhm
You know you know it 's just totally natural , probably because I have my own place ,
but %um you know , a lot of good things are happening .
Like the show is coming up .
I 'm in the middle of framing these photographs for the show
and show 's coming up
and I 've got my book into a couple of different collections and things like that
mhm
and %uh just you know seeing people that I have n't seen in a long time and you know getting to know a couple of people a little bit better ,
like I got to know %um Karen
remember %uh Laura 's friend , Karen Rosenflat ?
yeah
yeah
yeah
I got to know her like a-
I mean we went to school together and everything like that
but I did n't really know her very well .
I got to know her a bit better .
I got to know my sister - in - law Arty 's wife better
and you know it 's been kind of nice just being back , you know ? mhm and stuff
but %um god when I come back to Berlin , %um it 's going to be like You know stressed from day one %uh yeah because the show is coming up in the Vica
and %um
Want to hear something funny
I wanted to show those objects you know those overpainted objects in the glass cases and stuff
and I 'm going to make pedestals What ? for them and stretch this kind of brocade fabric uh-huh around these panels you know of the pedestals
and they 're pairing me together with another like conceptual minimalist %um Gunda Fursta who did like a red projection like a slide projection of a red color onto a wall as like a last you know work that she did .
I think this one gallery
I mean unless it 's an ugly red . You know ,
but it 's probably just going to be a very deep kind of red you know
I think it 's going to kind of look funny
where is that going to be ?
in the &
where is that again ?
they moved .
They used to be on %uh Furssdom
and they moved to Brunemstrascher
Budem , right ?
Brunemstra-
Brunemstrascher ,
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
so
it 's going to be
this Hai Tawanly show that I saw in New York when I was there is here now
Where
at the %uh
yeah
really
the only stop in Europe
oh wow is it going to still be open when I get back
%uh yeah
until November some time
oh good
oh good good good because I like his work
I 'd like to see that
it 's a big show
yeah
it 's great
I sold a book to the Museum of Modern Art
Did I tell you that ?
No
oh
and I sent one to the Whitney
Well
but I have n't heard anything From them
I mean it 's just a measly little book
if you know what I mean
but
because I got like a total thrill out of that
what do you mean you sold a book to them
%uh %uh %um the little drain book you know
yeah
I sold them one
they bought one
the archives
oh the archives oh
yeah
yeah
because I 've been trying to get it around into other %um archives
but I have n't had you know any good response
Now your name is listed in the Museum of Modern Art
I do n't even think so
no
yeah
right
it 'll be engraved in stone on the outside
well not that but somewhere in the computer
%um poss-
yeah
it 's somewhere in the %um archives
archives
computer
computer
right
right
yeah
but I do n't even know if that 's considered officially part of the collection you know
Lilly stop that
just
what she doing ?
She 's fucking got my chair completely
oh my god
she 's scratching all the time up
I 'll have to get her a scratching post
and then she does these things
she loves like being under the red material under the chairs
yeah
and then like %uh sometimes she drives me crazy
I mean I like playing with her like that
but
yeah
I sit here
and I do n't even know that she 's under the material
oh god
and then I 'll let my arm hanging down
and then she like you know jumps at my arm and starts
and she thinks I want to play with her
and then sometimes I 'm just really like shocked
she 's very very playful
yeah
she 's very playful
oh %uh
that 's going to be nice to see Lilly again
we have two cats here
and one them is kind of dumb
A lot of people who come from two different religions go there .
oh yeah .
yeah ,
okay .
yeah .
mhm %hm .
So it was wonderful
and %um
And then what was the , %um , reception like ?
Well we went out into the garden and sort of had an informal receiving line ,
and then everybody went up to North Park and changed clothes ,
and uh-huh . we played softball , and , %uh , volleyball , and four square , and had dancing and music and great food , and
Wow , that sounds like a lot of fun .
It was .
Wow .
It sounds like it was great
yeah a lot of people told us it was the best wedding they had ever been to ,
and that 's , I guess , the highest compliment you can get .
Wow .
So ,
and where , did you guys go on a honeymoon ?
We went on a honeymoon to this island off the coast of Puerto Rico . oh god . In the Carribean .
But the hardest part was getting there .
I mean , we had to take three planes to get there .
But the
We got this book from my mom about the Carribean .
And , %um . I 'd always wanted to go to the Carribean .
So we just decided okay , we 'll go .
We only went for five days .
It was pretty short
but , %um . uh-huh . The place was totally laid back .
It was this old plantation house that , %um , had this twenty - four rooms .
and , they said in the book like you wo n't be able to tell the guests from the staff .
And mhm . %um , it was really , really cool .
And they have , you know , mismatched sheets and stuff .
It was n't fancy at all ,
but it was really cheap .
And uh-huh They just had the bar open all the time .
You could go and get whatever you wanted and just write it on your guest ticket .
And oh my god . They picked fresh mangoes from the yard for breakfast , and stuff .
It was great .
Wow , it sounds idyllic .
It was really tiny ,
so ,
the island is only ten miles long .
uh-huh .
%um . But it was good cause you know , everybody speaks English ,
and yet it 's still pretty exotic , you know .
uh-huh .
We went snorkeling .
And , it wa-
God , it sounds great .
That 's something I really regret is that Norm and I did n't have a honeymoon .
yeah ,
well you should go on one anyway
yes .
yeah ,
we were planning on going on one one of these days ,
but I do n't know now what 's going to happen .
Well , you 'll just have to take your kid .
I know
I think it would be really funny if we go right now and tell people we 're going on our honeymoon .
How big are you ?
%um , well actually I 've only gained four pounds . uh-huh . But is it showing ? Which is not a lot you know , for how far I am ,
but I 'm definitely pregnant .
yeah
I mean I have all of the .
You know I need to give myself the extra support when I get up .
And uh-huh . like , you know like how wide you put your feet apart when you get up ?
uh-huh .
Well I have to probably put my feet like five inches further apart and kind of hoist myself up sort of like .
uh-huh .
So .
Which is pretty funny
yeah ,
I 'm definitely pregnant .
But I 'm not huge by any means .
But what are you five and a half months now ?
yeah .
So , it 's just starting to get into the part where you start to show . And uh-huh . start to get big and the whole bit .
But it 's weird .
Like , you go like , %um , like I 'm not fatter in anywhere . uh-huh . Except my stomach .
I mean it honestly looks like I swallowed
I mean it 's really weird .
Like You can s- .
I 've never really like been up close to a pregnant woman before
but you know , like I 've seen them at the gym and stuff like that , but never had a good friend that lived close by that was pregnant that I could like actually look at her .
uh-huh .
But you can see the line of your uterus .
You can see in your stomach where it is .
It 's like this big circle
and it sticks out in that big circle .
And it 's filling up with a -- yeah . -- thing . An alien presence .
That 's totally what it feels like .
Really .
Does it move around yet ?
oh yeah .
he kicks a lot .
I do n't know that it 's a he ,
but I call him he .
He kicks a lot .
He 's been kicking for about five weeks now .
%huh .
But , %um , he just started this week .
He started rolling that I can feel .
I mean they roll the whole time ,
but now I can feel him rolling ,
and it 's totally bizarre .
It 's
Do you have a name for it , I mean like you know a joke name that you call it ?
Like
No .
I 've heard some really good ones .
But The only one that I came up with was Thumper , cause he just kicks so much .
He 's really an active baby .
Thumper .
Well that 's good .
yeah .
Healthy .
Well , also the monster child is the other thing I call him .
The monster child .
Rosemary 's baby .
I know .
Well , %um . Because he kicks so much , you know , it 's really annoying .
I mean
Does it wake you up ?
No he has n't woken me up yet ,
but if I wake up in the middle of the night , he does kick
and so you can feel him kicking in the middle of the night if you wake up .
What if it 's a girl ?
Well , it 's probably not a girl , because in our family , if you go on both sides of our family , and you look at all our first cousins , and everything , it 's like seventy five percent male .
%huh .
But it might be a girl .
I was positive it was a girl .
Like the first three months , I was absolutely positive it was a girl .
And then I changed my mind an-
now she is a boy .
Well that 'll be a surprise then .
yeah ,
yeah .
I do n't know .
Are you going to ask them not to tell you if you had
oh we 're not having an ultrasound .
uh-huh .
Because it 's really like ,
We went and looked up all this research .
There 's all this stuff .
You 'll see when you get pregnant .
And , if you want to know , just send me email . Because I looked up a bunch of stuff ,
but , there 's all different kinds of prenatal tests that you can get now .
It 's not just amnio ,
it 's like other stuff too .
uh-huh .
And then there 's also , %um , you know , %uh , the ultrasound .
But in fact , like if you look at the latest research on ultrasound , it 's like , they really do n't know .
Like they assume that it 's safe , because , you know , they 've had it for twenty years , right .
And nothing has happened ?
They never
Ye- ,
well they do n't know .
They 've never really done any big studies on it or anything .
but if you 're a normal , low ,
like there 's reasons to have an ultrasound .
And if you have to have an ultrasound , then it 's a really good diagnostic tool , right ?
Right .
But in a normal low risk pregnancy like mine it 's not a good diagnostic tool at all .
Like , they find as many , %um , false positives as they do false negatives .
for spina bifida and stuff ?
Well the only thing they can really check , they can check the heart .
uh-huh .
And then they can check to see if the baby has a brain .
yeah . But then they can do some measurements to see if the baby has , %um , %ah
Defects of various kinds .
Like Down 's Syndrome .
Like sometimes y- .
But that 's not really very good .
Like amnio is the only sure way to find out .
Right .
But it could give you like some indications that the baby might have Down 's or something .
But it 's really not a very good diagnostic tool at all for people with low risk pregnancies .
So , yeah . I did n't bother getting one .
yeah ,
good .
I 'm sure everything will be fine .
oh yeah .
And if it 's not , it 's like , you know , you 're going to have to deal with it anyway .
Well what are you going to do I mean , if it 's not , like
and we did n't do any of the testing because , like , I 've met like three people since I got pregnant , where the baby had Down 's , right .
They found out the baby had Down 's .
And they aborted it .
They had ,
well , it 's not called abortion , it 's called termina-
Termination ,
that 's right .
And I just could n't have done that .
I just .
We talked about it a little bit ,
you know what I mean .
Like obviously I do n't want my baby to have a mental defect or anything like that .
But
But if it does , you 'll deal with it .
I just could not have done that .
So it was n't worth doing the prenatal testing . Because , you know
If you 're not going to abort anyway , then there 's no reason to have it .
yeah .
I mean there are some conditions that they can test for that are sort of incompatible with life .
Right .
But then I figured , well , I 'll just go through the nine months of pregnancy and then the baby will die when it 's born . You know .
If it 's like that .
yeah .
yeah ,
we had this friend .
This is not supposed to scare you ,
it 's just because it was on the topic .
%um , but , the baby died at like eight and a half months .
%mm .
I know .
I read so many of those stories .
They just freak me out .
You know .
And of course they make you give birth anyway .
You know you ca n't have an
You have to .
I mean what are .
I mean that 's how you have an abortion is you give birth you kn-
yeah .
And it 's dead
you know it 's dead .
And it 's a hassle , you know .
And you 've got to go through all that pain knowing the baby 's not even alive anyway .
yeah .
But , you know . She 's pregnant again .
You know , they 're fine .
And what happened to the baby ?
Do they know ?
They got over it .
I think it got either strangled by its cord or some kind of
yeah
that 's what they g- .
They always say that g-
They say that
but
cord accident .
it was an accident .
It 's like they do n't know .
yeah ,
you know . It 's like something happened .
or maybe it went into oxygen deficiency or something .
Like something happened to her
and she was asleep at the time ,
yeah .
mhm .
and so she did n't even know it until the next morning .
And
It was something like that .
Wow .
That is so scary .
But obviously , you know , when you have a baby for the rest of its life and your life , you have to worry that it might die , you know , or something will happen to it .
oh I know it is so scary .
It 's awful .
That 's got to be the worst thing .
Well anyhow , did you get to meet your nephew %uh I did . The baby Jack is huge . at the wedding .
he 's four months
and he 's like eighteen pounds .
oh my god .
The kid is ado- .
But it 's all breast milk .
That 's huge .
That 's like the size of a two year old is n't it ?
He 's huge .
he 's the shape of a small baby
but you know , he 's big .
He 's heavy .
oh , you better hope that that does n't run in the family .
How big was he when he was born .
Well . He was normal size when he was born .
Like eight and a half pounds .
okay .
yeah .
But , %um , you know , my uncle is like six foot four ,
and my brother is big ,
and , on Gaelin 's side of the family there 's big people too .
So , I mean , he could just be a big boy
That 's
I mean eighteen pounds .
That is humongous .
Eighteen pounds from breast milk alone in four months .
oh my god .
And yet he 's small . You know ,
he does n't look that huge .
He 's not very long or anything
he 's just .
uh-huh .
And He 's chubby
but He just weighs .
He 's hefty .
yup
yeah
well you know they just tell you feed on demand .
I mean if they want to eat that much you let them eat that much .
and he 's healthy and all
so you know she 's just like oh well
uh-huh
uh-huh
And do they seem happy and ?
he did n't command the legs , %huh ?
mhm
sometimes not as much as he would like to be ,
but he 's doing really good .
and Now I think that he 's got kind of control
uh-huh
he 's much sweeter
uh-huh
188.81_192.55_B: yeah ,
he seems to have a ,
well I mean he was sweet before ,
but
well , it 's a frustrating process to be always falling down , %huh ?
yeah ,
and now he 's usually better ,
now he 's pretty fussy
but oi
yeah
so , how have you been ?
work and Elizabeth ?
and
yeah ,
that was a hard trip
%uh , she 's not at all well , matter of fact
I would n't be surprised to get a phone call anytime .
oh , really ?
yeah ,
she was wanting to die while we were there .
really .
yeah ,
she 's had her fourth stroke
and oh gosh . there 's a lot of pain on her left side ,
and she ca n't walk without a walker ,
and she ca n't go but a few steps ,
and %mm so she lives in a chair and on couch and back in her hospital bed , right there within a few feet of each other .
%mm
and she 's so used to being , you know up and busy , and in control , and able to do and
and she ca n't ?
no .
so she 's finishing her autobiography and then %uh wanting to die , but not lifting off ,
so she 's pretty angry and irritable .
wondering what 's the hold up .
yeah .
but her mother died %ah , four years after having a stroke ,
so
oh yeah ?
yeah ,
so she 's not supposed to die yet , evidently .
yeah ,
it 's not time
well , that 's a rough trip ,
but
yeah ,
but Laura was able to help her with the book a bit , you know by her sort of secretly wanting her to read it . and tell what sections are where
and I was packing up things for her to send to people , ,
she wants to ,
you know , things for her family and things
oh yeah
it was kind of a hard and sad trip , in that way ,
but %ah , she sent us off to Sonoma one day ,
we went up to Sonoma
and that 's nice
uh-huh
aw we were so wretched hot , we just sort of stayed in the car and drove .
Drove off to the sights , you know ?
yeah ,
I ca n't imagine how hot it would be .
yeah .
but still I looked on the ,
least last night still did n't ,
a hundred down there
uh-huh
so it 's been %ah ninety or a hundred for a month now jeez down there .
and today and yesterday was the first day in a long time that we 've had it less than a hundred , or ninety
and so it 's in the eighties
and it feel marvelous .
wow
and so we finally get some relief from the weather .
it 's like autumn here .
I mean , 342.14_342.66_A: is that right ? yeah , it 's about fifty , fifty five .
yeah ,
that 's right ,
you 're all ready ,
you 've got a short summer , %huh ,
so it 's all ready yeah moving into it ,
yeah
yeah ,
and it smells and it feels like autumn .
is that right ?
, yeah ,
it has for about a week or so .
getting a little crisp %huh ?
mhm .
yeah ,
shorts weather is definitely gone ,
I do n't know if it ever really came .
I was waiting
Wait a second ,
what 's going on ?
well I 'm a Finnish T V star .
374.10_374.55_A: are you ?
yeah ,
you were on T V ?
well , I 'm going to be .
oh you are
I did the filming last Thursday .
Alexia are you okay ?
and , %um , it 's kind of a cultural show , %um
uh-huh , inter -- to -- view the Americans ?
yeah ,
and we do like little skits on like how %um , Americans react to things differently than other cultures , and oh , neat Finnish culture ,
so we like do the subway scene of Americans in the subway , and Finns in the subway .
they 're pretty funny
I 'll bet that was fun , %huh ?
yeah ,
I think it 'll be pretty interesting
it does n't %um air until January fifteenth ,
but it 's pretty fun I think , because they had French , and German , and Asian , and
I 'll be interested to see how they put it all together .
yeah
%um , yeah ,
see how it ends up ,
so
, so will it be in Finnish ,
or
no .
well we spoke in English ,
but it 's like a Finnish documentary .
it 's a Finnish documentary
but it has all these sections to it ?
yeah
yeah ,
neat
yeah ,
like different parts of movies and stuff ,
so I 'm going to see if I can get my American friend to tape it .
neat .
Yammi and I are saving up for one of those V C R's that have the mode ,
so maybe by then we 'll have one ,
we can tape it
and yes it seems interesting what they 're doing ,
so
yeah ,
so it 'll be a cross culture center %huh ?
yeah ,
and they 're paying me
so , it 's like
is that right ?
yeah ,
I thought it 's pretty nice
yeah
pays to be a foreigner sometimes , I guess
, not all the time , but sometimes
yeah ,
right
so that 's what we 've been doing here ,
just kind of Yammi 's been taking a few days off while I go and
oh so it was not just a little thing then , %huh
well , it was just a couple times
just went a couple times
and oh . uh-huh then if they want to use me later or something they 'll call
oh neat
yeah ,
but it 's pretty fun
neither of us could act .
well , was it like a Helsinki station or ?
, no it 's a Finnish station .
oh
on T V one
and
%hm
so it 's just for the
Alexi honey , come here sweetie
he got the door shut ,
and he 's kind of cranky now
do you want to get him ?
yeah ,
hold on , just a second .
okay I forgot it 's free ,
so you do n't have to
, that 's right
we were worried so much mhm about it ,
but
you would 've love this house we saw honey .
oh yeah
it was unbelievable
Frank Lloyd Wright 's %huh ?
yeah
aw
it would be nice to live in now , you know
yeah ?
and it was built in nineteen oh two
and it 's probably modern looking yeah as it would seem to me
yeah ,
yeah ,
it was just gorgeous
aw
and that glass , extraordinary art glass throughout , in the
the %ah , chandeliers in the dining room were butterfly design
and , oh wow there were butterfly designs in the door coming in
and just gorgeous
wow
built for sixty thousand dollars really back in nineteen oh two
yeah ,
a while back I think .
wow .
it would have been nice to see .
I really enjoy that calendar yeah you guys sent , the Frank Lloyd Wright calendar yeah looking at it ,
I like it .
a lot of people have made comments about who 's this , you know , who did this ?
%hm
coolest
Frank Lloyd Wright
but , yeah ,
I looked into a masters' program here yeah in ,
and they cost seventy thousand marks a year
%huh
so that 's like what ?
twenty four thousand or something ?
you 're kidding .
no .
I thought , whoa .
that 's pretty steep considering all the other education 's free here ,
yeah .
yeah ,
so what 's the deal ?
well , it 's especially for --
private school
well no ,
but , they , do n't have masters program
does kind of ,
it 's new , starting out this year
and it 's %um designed to fit the States ' idea of undergrad and masters program , you know
%uh
so , I 'm going to see about trying to just get into the regular school , and trying to continue like maybe next year or something ,
but
yeah .
so being a Finnish citizen , or being married to a Finnish citizen does n't help you in that way ,
that
well not for that masters program it does n't
but for just going , if I wanted just to take classes to receive a Finnish degree , which is equivalent to a masters
Alexi come here
hold on dad ,
I 'm sorry .
okay
okay ,
sorry
hey , mister Alexi
nap time
he 's getting kind of cranky ,
I 'll let him bang on the key board a little bit ,
but I 'm going to take a Finnish course and see how that goes
well that 's probably the next step anyway , is n't it ?
yeah
get good at your Finnish , %huh
for me ,
mhm
and I 'm
so it 'll be nice ,
get started and see how that goes then ,
%um , I tried to send you guys cards , couple weeks ago , and realized that I did n't have your address
oh , you want to write it down ?
yeah .
, what is it ?
fifty one fifty eight Hawthorn Drive
Hawthorn Drive ,
okay
that 's four six two two six is n't it ?
two two six
six
okay , thanks .
Because we had it all ready , and then went to look ,
and I was like I have their phone number ,
and that 's it .
so
I bought you a little coffee cup from Tullyesa
and I still hav n't gotten it in the mail ,
so
So tell me a little bit about the day she was born .
When did you first see her ?
%um what happened is we went to the hospital ,
she was induced .
mhm .
So we get a phone call
and Right finally . %um the birth mom was supposed to go in %um , it 's my thinking that this will be distributed publicly . Right . at %um six thirty in the morning
but she called
and they did n't have any beds .
oh no .
So she called us and told us that ,
but then they did get a bed
and she went in at eight . mhm . Or seven thirty or ,
I guess she went in at seven thirty
and they started her at eight or
so we hopped in the car and drove down to be there mhm . %mm mhm . for the day .
mhm .
And %um , we hung out all day .
%uh we had some difficult times with the lawyer down there .
He was supposed to show up
%mm
mhm .
and we waited all day
and he never bloody showed up .
oh no .
and also she was expecting him too . mhm . You know
and so that was frustrating .
yeah .
But anyway we waited all day
%um But then five twenty five Mae was born .
Right .
And the birth mother 's mother was with her through the whole thing
and she was fantastic .
She was just great .
She was so nice to us and so solid there for her daughter and just a wonderful uh-huh . mhm . Woman person
and %um She was great .
She came out , you know , a couple times during the day
she came out and gave us little progress reports of how things were going
and actually it was very funny uh-huh . because the first time she out ,
I mean here we 're out there sort of ringing our hands and uh-huh . sweating it out and wondering how everybody is going and everything
and she came out
and could I go downstairs because %um , her daughter wanted playing cards .
uh-huh .
So I guess she was bored .
uh-huh .
You know passing the time
So I went downstairs to get playing cards with her
uh-huh . and then later on she came out
and she wanted some chewing gum .
uh-huh .
%um , I guess your mouth gets dry
and you just want something .
yeah .
I 'm sure .
So , you know , it was kind of funny these very
Reassuring in a way I would think .
yeah ,
but these very %um ,
yeah .
you know they 're such sort of specific little things .
yeah .
but they kind of held her back .
I think the baby would 've been born sooner
but the doctor did n't get there till around three .
So
so I thought once it was induced there was like no stopping it .
No they can hold you back %hm . a little bit , you know .
%hm .
Once ,
depends how much stuff they give you .
How much stuff they give you .
yeah .
Stuff .
But anyway I think they were holding her back a little bit because they wanted the doctor there .
mhm
uh-huh .
%um , and the doctor showed up around three
and Mae was born at five twenty five .
mhm .
Eight pounds eight ounces .
mhm .
And screaming .
mhm .
Really screaming
and I was a little scared .
I thought oh my god what have we wrought .
You could here her out through the doors of the hall , you know .
uh-huh .
And there were a lot of babies being born .
You did n't hear them all .
uh-huh .
And I ,
and %um , what happened h- ,
I guess %um ,
that 's right .
Her mom came running out to tell us the baby was born .
uh-huh .
And then she said that 's her .
You can hear her
And %um , said it was a beautiful birth .
I mean two pushes and she was out which is really great
so she 's very unsquashed and unbattered looking for a new baby .
uh-huh mhm .
Right .
Usually they look a bit bashed up .
yeah .
A bit worn .
But she 's got a nice shaped head
and , you know she does n't look like she was %um ,
you know she 's not a cone head .
mhm .
But did you get to see her in a few hours
or
a-
Well what happened
no
right away there was a very nice %um delivery nurse who we had spoken to earlier in the day named Tina .
mhm .
mhm .
mhm .
And what they do is they take the baby from the delivery room to the nursery .
mhm .
Normally they go directly
and Tina very , very sweetly zipped past the door to the outer part of the nursery where we were waiting mhm . mhm outside mhm . and let us hold her .
mhm .
So she was just minutes old then .
Wow .
So we held her for just a couple minutes
and uh-huh . it was really funny because you could hear her coming up the hall screaming uh-huh . loudly .
uh-huh .
.
She handed her to me screaming loudly
and I said to Tina and also to uh-huh . the birth mother 's mother there , you know oh Robert has the magic touch .
I handed her to Robert .
Instant silence .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
Instant .
She just stopped screaming immediately .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
So he held her for a little while .
And then the nurse was afraid to take her back .
Said oh she 's going to scream again .
uh-huh .
And she did
uh-huh .
And off they went to the nursery
and then you watched through the glass
That must have been very reassuring for Robert .
It was very nice was n't it .
It was very wonderful for Robert and for me too just to see ,
I knew it would work too .
Very nice .
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah .
I do n't know what it is .
He has some ,
you have a theory .
Body warmth or something
but anyway .
yeah .
I think it 's partly it
but there 're certain kind of men who ,
I think it 's men who have like these big
I have this theory that it 's men who are very broad right under the elbow you know like ,
Wait a minute .
Broad under the elbow .
You mean in the chest ?
like
No .
From the elbow down towards the wrist .
oh .
Who have like these big broad forearms .
I think babies like that .
You think it gives security .
I suppose .
Do you remember Otto who moved my filing cabinet that time in Philadelphia
he 's another one ? Yes . uh-huh . uh-huh . yeah . He 's big . He 's sort of solid to me . who
He 's sort of very solid
and they just love it .
But Robert 's not big like that .
No ,
but Robert is big below the elbows I 'll bet if you check .
I 'll have to check out below Robert 's elbows
At any rate , %um
So that was nice
and then we watched through the nursery while they do ,
if you survive the first four hours of life in the nursery you 'll survive anything after .
It 's the most sort of appalling introduction to life .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
But I was kind of scared at that point because we 're looking in and there 're all these nice sweet little pale babies lying there limp
uh-huh .
and there 's Mae
and she 's big compared to the rest
and she was bright red
and she is screaming
and she screamed
and she screamed
and she screamed
and all the rest of them as soon as they
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
Um - huh
uh-huh
they sort of get exhausted after two screams and collapse .
yeah .
And she was healthy I guess .
uh-huh .
And she just screamed and screamed and screamed and screamed and screamed
and I thought oh my god what have we wrought here .
Did they tell you her apgar or whatever they call that ?
How
They did n't tell us anything .
In fact , at the hospital the individual people we had contact with were decent to us and friendly
Were nice .
but %um the hospital policy was rather unfriendly to us
and they would n't ,
like we had been told ,
they have a room called the bonding room
yeah .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
and the whole purpose of the room is to let people be in it with the baby , who -- uh-huh . -- are going to be with the baby .
Right .
And they would n't let us in there
so , %mm . it was really quite awful .
They would n't let us ,
they did n't ,
they gave us
but they did n't tell us beans .
yeah .
I mean they really did n't talk to us .
They did n't offer us that parenting class that they offer to most people .
mhm .
We would have had to come back the next day to the hospital which of course we were n't going to do .
%hm .
mhm .
%um , you know they really were n't very nice
and yeah . I guess they have ,
their rules are just very rigid .
%mm .
And the problem is the lawyer was supposed to have arranged for %um Right . an additional bracelet .
mhm .
In other words , what happens is they put one on the wrist of the baby , one on the ankle , one on the birth mother
and then she has what you call the fourth bracelet which she can give to whoever will be her coach through the birth and stuff
and of course she had given it to her mother , %hm . mhm . %hm . I see . I see . which makes perfect sense .
mhm .
Well , the only way ,
they could n't get their minds around the notion of a fifth bracelet for us .
Right .
So the only way that they would have let us in there was to take her mothers away , Right . which we would n't ask and which she would n't do .
Right .
Right .
And %um the lawyer had told us he had arranged everything ahead of time
and there was supposed to be I D there at the hospital for us
and it was all set
and of course he had n't done anything .
I see .
He had n't done that , %hm .
No .
He had n't done anything .
He 's been just hopeless .
%hm .
I mean I think legally he 's not hopeless .
I think he 's done all the necessary legal things
but %um yeah . you know in terms of the things ,
He 's an S O B
forgive me tape whoever you are
but he was a fucker .
yeah .
No .
th-
And %um I 'm sorry
but he was .
I think they said published actually .
oh well they can edit that word I guess
Anyway it 's English
so
yeah .
It 's American English .
%um
You know he said things to me like well you 'll have her for the rest of your life , you know . yeah . Do n't worry about it , which is really an arrogant attitude to take , you know .
yeah
yeah
Man .
yeah .
he was a real arrogant S O B ,
so
How old was he ?
I do n't know
we never met him .
He never showed up .
oh .
he ended up
in the end , he sent his partner to actually sign the papers who 's not even an adoption attorney .
mhm .
He does litigation .
Does n't know what he 's doing
but I hope he did what his partner told him to do .
mhm .
%mm
mhm .
But he at least was a sensitive human being .
mhm .
%um , you know so that was nice .
He had some sensitivity .
We 're going to get cut off soon .
oh no
And I want to ,
I hope you
Tell me something then .
I 'll shut up .
You can tell me something .
What ?
okay .
No .
I 'm not worrying
I 'm feeling like oh my gosh should all of this be in the public record or something .
oh yes .
Well they just beeped .
I think that might mean we have to hang up .
okay .
We have a minute .
%um .
I want to tell you I saw four parakeets fly across the street in Barcelona .
oh neat .
Is it thirty minutes ?
It was beautiful .
Is it
It 's going to be thirty minutes in about five minutes I think .
oh okay
because there 's a beep coming on my end .
yeah .
You do n't hear it ?
No .
okay .
Well ignore it
so we 'll let them go on .
Well anyway .
oh so that sounds very nice .
They were loose or in a
Well they were loose
they were
I said the Sheila I think I hear a parakeet .
uh-huh
And you could tell he thought that it was nonsense that it was a uh-huh crow
and then I saw it
but the sun was against my eyes
oh how neat
so I could n't tell
and then it flew
and when it flew three more of them flew out of the same tree .
oh how neat .
They were beautiful . there was a street I walked down in Barcelona big wide
with all the bird sellers
Yes .
They were closed up that day
but I 'm sure that what these were is Well it was a wonderful place I mean I guess you have to sort of discount that they 're in cages but Escapees
yeah
yeah
it 's part of
it was beautiful
yeah .
I mean it was just so beautiful with all these amazing yeah . birds and colors .
And also in parts of Spain ,
I do n't know if they have this in parts of France ,
but Probably not
I saw parts of Spain where they had birds on the shutters and they put them out during the day .
It 's very popular in Spain
but it 's not so popular here in France .
yeah .
It was a nice thing .
yeah .
%um I 've seen very little of it .
yeah .
y-
I had friends in Madrid whose father bred birds actually .
oh really ?
In their apartment .
yeah .
It 's quite a big hobby .
Parakeets or ?
No little tiny birds .
I do n't know what they were .
Little
Finches maybe .
yeah .
Song birds of some kind .
uh-huh .
oh neat .
And he was good at breeding them .
uh-huh .
so
oh well that 's good
So
but when you went up to Connecticut , all was well ?
Or was that another adventure ?
up to Connecticut ?
Did I go to
Then you had to go up and get Jack and everything after
oh yeah
it 's New York still
but .
oh .
%um yeah
we got up .
We got Jack .
We went to our lawyer who 's been mhm . Absolutely fantastic start to finish .
I think she 's great .
mhm . mhm .
%um and then came home
and yeah then Robert 's mom crashed the car .
oh I see
it was after that that she did that .
So yeah
actually we had to do that at like eight o'clock the next morning because Martha was leaving by nine .
So mom and dad were down there for how long ?
They came Saturday and stayed Saturday night and Sunday and left Monday
uh-huh .
This past Monday like
