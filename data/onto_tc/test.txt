I just got back from the gym .
oh good .
uh-huh .
How 's it going ?
oh pretty well .
It was really crowded today .
yeah .
I kind of assumed everyone would be at the shore .
uh-huh .
I was wrong .
Well it 's the middle of the week or whatever
so .
But it 's the fourth of July .
%mm .
So .
yeah .
People have to work tomorrow .
Do you have to work tomorrow ?
yeah .
Did you have off yesterday ?
Yes .
oh that 's good .
And I was paid too .
oh .
Is it paid today ?
No .
oh .
But %uh
yeah ,
so the gym 's going well .
oh .
But I still need to go more often .
Well how often are you going ?
Only four days a week .
.
yeah .
Got to get that up to five .
%mm .
But , I do n't really like going with Anne Marie because she does n't like to stay very long .
Why ?
I do n't know .
She kind of ,
well unfortunately for some reason she 's not like into cardio vascular .
So when I 'm still riding the bike she 's completely finished her weight lifting routine .
mhm .
And like I have n't even started mine . mhm . You know
and I kind of hinted to her that really the only way to lose weight is cardio vascular . mhm . It 's true . And that lifting the weights wo n't lose weight .
%mm %mm .
You wo n't lose it , you know ,
but
No
I mean you might lose some
but that 's only when yo- .
For a woman who is lifting not that much I do n't think yeah . You would .
I mean yeah
I mean the only thing is %um just getting your heart rate up for extended periods of time .
yeah ,
So I do n't know
maybe she 'll catch on soon .
You do burn a lot of calories an hour though , lifting weights .
uh-huh .
But %uh
yeah
I mean I do n't think you 're going to lose that much .
and also lifting weights at Bally 's means you 're standing on line for as much time as you 're actually lifting .
Really .
yeah .
That 's too bad .
yeah .
So is it really overcrowded ?
Well , I mean obviously since I work I ca n't get there until about six o'clock at night which is when everyone else gets there .
mhm .
mhm .
But I 'm sure for people who go in the daytime it 's probably dead . yeah . You know
and %um , like when I go Saturday and Sunday mornings it 's totally dead .
mhm .
So
But you know the weeknights is pretty crazy .
yeah .
yeah
I found a gym yesterday here that 's only eight pounds a month which is like twelve dollars , twelve fifty
oh yeah .
Wow .
yeah .
It 's at the hospital nearby .
Well that 's a deal .
yeah .
yeah .
So uh-huh . I think %um tonight Charlie and I are going to go over and join up .
Even Charlie 's going to join ?
No ,
but it has to be debited from a bank account so it 's got to be debited from his .
yeah .
In your letter you said that he eats constantly .
oh my god .
Really ?
Alice , I 've never seen anybody eat as much as he does
and he 's so skinny .
mhm .
I mean the amount of cereal he eats like between meals and after meals
yeah .
and we go through a box of cereal every two days .
Really ?
yeah .
Wow .
He eats at least like four of cereal a day like in addition to like meals .
uh-huh
And when he goes to work he brings four sandwiches with him , uh-huh . a bag of potato chips uh-huh . %um you know and then little sweetie things chocolates and **cakies** and stuff like that .
uh-huh
And then you know before he leaves every morning he has like two fried eggs mhm on toast with cheese %um vegetarian sausages %um and like fruit
and oh my god it 's just crazy .
mhm .
It 's crazy how much he eats .
He was probably starving when he was here .
yeah .
I think what we got to do is just when he comes just have lots of cereal .
He likes Cocoa Pops .
oh boy .
Wow .
That 's pretty crazy .
yeah .
It 's all about being a blue collar man .
I guess so .
They 're the ones who can eat all day .
Really ?
Well I mean he does work his ass off
so
yeah .
But %uh 291.01_291.28_B: %hm .
%hm .
So , I assume it 's hard for you not to eat as much as he does .
No .
I learned quick fast in a hurry because I 've gained so much weight .
oh really ?
yeah .
Actually in the first week I was here -- mhm . -- I gained a lot
so .
Well it 's hard to you know not eat when somebody else is eating .
Well I 'm figuring it out fast because -- okay -- with not working out and all yeah . it 's pretty miserable my crunch tape .
%mm .
So I called this woman today
and %um , she 's a dressmaker
and we 're going to go see her next Thursday and talk about her making my wedding dress .
Slate green .
yeah .
%uh .
See , that way I can have exactly what I want .
Exactly .
And it 's only going to be about two hundred and fifty pounds which is about three hundred and fifty dollars .
uh-huh .
So it 's pretty good I mean comparatively .
yeah .
And it 'll be exactly what I want
and it 'll look good on me , you know like fit me , Sure . which is necessary at the moment because I 'm plump
so .
mhm .
Now , daddy got %um the invitations together for you today .
uh-huh .
And in it I put , %um paint samples from Sherwin Williams uh-huh . of all the different like shades of what color I thought you might be thinking of for the bride 's maids .
uh-huh .
oh I already told them all black
but dad does n't want black he said .
Mom and dad wo n't have black .
They do n't want black ?
They 're really opposed to it .
Did you call Sharon and tell her that ?
No .
Could you do that ?
okay .
Could you call Kate and tell her that ?
yeah .
Just say you know my parents are really opposed to black .
yeah .
They wo n't buy me a black dress .
They wo n't ?
Here wait .
Let me look for my phonebook .
No .
Never mind .
I can just open the thing here .
Now wait .
What ,
god we got so much furniture in this tiny apartment .
It 's crazy .
There 's drawers everywhere , to figure out where everything is .
okay .
Let me give you Kate 's phone number .
You can just leave a message .
okay .
okay .
two one , two one two uh-huh . two two six uh-huh . O one two five .
okay .
okay .
I 'll do that .
But %uh ,
yeah ,
apparently like at Lisa Manachi 's wedding like the whole night people were talking about how bad the black dresses were .
Really ?
Like everyone at mom and dad 's table .
yeah .
Who was at mom and dad 's table ?
Weirdo
just all of Lorraine 's friends . mhm . Who you know of course most of them mom and dad had at least met once before .
mhm .
But %uh
yeah ,
and Adele still talks about the black dress .
What ?
How hideous they were .
Adele was n't at Lisa Manachi 's .
Adele went to the mass wedding .
She did ?
uh-huh .
oh .
And she wanted me to take her
and I refused to go
and she got mad .
Really ?
Well I said I would not feel comfortable going .
I was not invited . mhm . You know
and mom and dad were like well you know a wedding that 's a mass is open to everyone .
I was like well that 's fine
but I would not feel comfortable going .
mhm .
I think that would be obnoxious
and I think they would then feel guilty for not inviting me .
Right .
To -- -- you know the other thing , the reception .
I just would n't go .
%mm .
So they had to take it down and drive her home .
%mm .
So they 're always kind of pissy at me .
%mm . That 's okay .
yeah .
yeah .
I mean I 've been thinking about it
and the black 's not going to be so hot you know
but
mhm .
yeah .
Apparently they were also carrying lillies which is kind of goofy .
yeah .
Well I guess she did that because someone suggested that to her because you know the lillies the symbol of the virgin Mary .
mhm .
White lillies ?
White lillies and black dresses .
%mm , my goodness .
That 's funny .
yeah .
yeah .
Adele was carrying on that she thought she was at a funeral
and she had to keep reminding herself .
%mm .
So now you think my wedding 's going to be pretty tasteful right ?
But
oh yeah .
Now what about the matchbooks ?
Well I 'll work on it .
I still think about the matchbooks .
yeah .
I 'll tell dad that you still think about the
I have n't forgotten those
and they 'll still be enough time when I come home for me to order those .
yeah .
I 'll have remind him of that little -- -- item .
yeah .
%huh how fun- .
You know I was talking to my friend Heather from Wisconsin the other day --
-- and she 's telling me about you know her sister 's wedding .
And at her sister 's wedding %uh , they provided champagne and beer .
But if you wanted any other kind of drink you had to pay for it .
mhm .
yeah .
that 's actually kind of common
but -- oh it is . it 's pretty de classe .
Well I kind of thou- ,
I mean of course I did n't say anything to her .
yeah .
You know I said as far as I knew we were n't charging people .
yeah .
Now
But %uh ,
yeah
Dad and I went to buy the wine the other day .
And there were having a sale on the wine dad wanted .
Are you talking to me ?
Of course I 'm talking to you .
I can hardly hear you .
oh .
I thought you were talking to somebody else and like put the phone down or something .
I 'm talking to you .
oh .
yeah .
No dad told me that .
oh he did tell you .
It 's all Chilean .
yeah .
yeah .
Walnut Crest or Walnut Creek or -- %mm . -- something like that .
I do n't know .
%mm .
There 's a pretty good sale . %mm . So now we have to keep our eyes open for a champagne sale .
An- ,
do you know if Jack called Spencer yet ?
I told him this morning to do it this week .
uh-huh .
And he just keeps forgetting .
yeah .
But o-
How 's he doing ?
Much better .
yeah ?
yeah .
he 's often chipper .
He went for a walk this morning at five seventeen .
Pe-
oh my god .
Is that because he 's not sleeping and
Well because he could n't breathe because all the cats were in the bedroom .
oh .
So I think it 's time to give all the cats a bath .
%mm .
yeah
and the- ,
you should do that .
I know .
It 's a two person job though .
I 'll have to get somebody to help me .
%mm . yeah .
%hm .
%um , how are you guys ?
How is Chris
and how are you ?
Well pretty well .
Chris is not here at the moment .
She 's been away with her class oh . up around Blandenburg for about two weeks on a , what they call Feldmessen .
Feldmessen is , %um , surveying .
%hm .
%uh , so she 's been away for two weeks .
She 's coming back tonight .
ha .
So we 're looking forward to that .
oh , I 'm sorry we 're going to miss her .
yeah ,
oh gosh . I bet you 're getting lonely .
yeah ,
well . Claudia 's been here
and we 've been doing okay .
%mm .
And I 'm actually waiting for Claudia to show up because we were supposed to go into town and meet some people in town .
I 've got a student here who 's checking out rooms and stuff .
%mm .
She 's coming in the fall ,
but she was in a place called Taiwa .
You know Tufts yeah . sent her to Taiwa
I had friends there . She did a course in Taiwa
and then she came over here , and %um , checked out a room here .
And so it 's
and the end semester is still going .
Of course it ends on the twenty second of July .
mhm .
So , %uh oh , yeah . things are busy .
yeah ,
gosh .
yeah .
You still got another month .
And then , are you coming over to the States at all this summer ?
No .
No .
No , no . %uh
Not even Chris ?
No , no , no . %uh
Not enough relatives left here anymore ?
Well the relative scene is kind of sad .
You know everybody 's kind of passed away , almost .
yeah ,
I remember when I talked to you in the fall yeah . yeah . that %uh
It 's just about
oh did your sister die ?
My sister passed away ,
yeah .
I do n't know if you spoke to me before that or when it was that was happening . Or
I guess not
When was it ?
It may have been right after .
Well
My father died right after we talked .
oh god .
yeah .
yeah ,
we 're getting old .
No , it 's ,
I do n't know what it is .
It 's just , %uh , people get sick ,
and they get sick pretty young ,
and ,
yeah .
And you know my sister was n't that old
and she just had bad luck I guess is all you can say .
yeah .
I 'm going to put you on after fifteen minutes .
I 've got to
And there was n't anything anybody could do .
So .
And then an aunt of Chris 's Aunt Mamie up in Maine passed away .
that had n't happ- ,
had that happened already ?
No
No that had not happened , no .
She passed away in about March or
yeah , I think that there was some concern about her when I talked to you in September or October .
.
yeah .
No , she was not doing well .
She had a brain tumor .
And then they operated on
and things were n't going well ,
and .
I actually got to see her I guess a day before she died .
oh .
I mean she did n't know that I was there .
if that was you , yeah . yeah , she was just not in
So it was a blessing , I guess .
But , %um .
Anyway , weird stuff .
yeah .
yeah .
And how about you ?
Because , I r-
oh I 'm han-
how are your eyes ?
yeah .
Well , I do n't know .
I have to go next week you know to see again .
I , %um , not exactly convinced that . It 's okay . You know ,
I 'm not sure .
%hm .
%uh , it 's been pretty good .
It was about eighty percent for a while .
And then %um , I 'm not exactly sure what it is now .
But I 'll know in a couple of days .
So are you having blurred vision ?
Or
oh yeah , yeah .
Sure .
The right eye is %uh , not so great .
%hm .
%um , and it got back to about eighty percent .
You know it was a detached retina .
Right .
And then they operated on it once ,
and they operated on it twice .
And , then things seemed to be doing pretty well ,
and at the moment I 'm %um , not quite so sure .
%hm .
So , who knows . %um .
%hm .
But you know it 'll never be more than about seventy or eighty percent . Which is fine .
Eighty percent is fantastic .
Right .
Right .
%um
So we 'll just see . You know
%hm . we 'll see what happens .
Frustrating .
%uh , yeah .
Annoying .
And that thing that came up recently , , you know I had , oh , a kind of a knee problem a couple of years ago .
And my right knee ,
and now it 's my left knee .
you know , it 's just a pain in the ass .
And yeah . %um , I went to the doctor
and they do a Punktion . Ich weiss nicht wer .
Anyway they take , %uh fluid out of it .
uh-huh .
And if it gets irritated take some pills and stuff .
And , it 's just a pain in the ass .
So it 's just , l- .
is that like water on the knee ?
Is that what that is ?
%um , well that 's what happens .
It develops because of irritation , because of a %um , inflammation .
%hm .
Is that from the running ?
And how the inflammation d-
yeah ,
maybe .
I mean they do n't know .
mhm .
They do n't
It just came overnight practically .
Wow .
%um , and %uh , we 'd been up in Berlin
and we had a big trip up there and did a lot of walking , a lot of fast walking and stuff .
But you know , I mean that mhm . should n't be a big deal . %um
Was this last crop of **Tuftees** good ?
So .
Was your last crop of students from Tufts good ?
How 's that ?
yeah
well they 're still here .
Right ,
but they 're winding down , so you know them really well by this point .
They 're winding down .
yeah ,
they 're very good .
they learned a lot of German .
They learned an amazing amount of German .
Before I forget , I saw George Silinas a couple of days ago .
oh . How 's he doing ?
And he 's had
Well he 's working for an American firm over here ,
and he 's doing very very well . %um ,
and his wife just had their fourth child .
Wow .
A little boy . Benjamin .
yeah .
Wow .
%um , about , %uh , two weeks ago maybe .
%huh .
Tops .
And I got a card from ,
you remember Amy Gleason ?
yeah .
yeah .
Well she just had a baby a couple of
heard that .
Well this is number two .
okay .
I just got a card from Ron and Doris ,
oh .
and they see Amy Gleason on occasion .
And so I think they told me that .
yeah .
Have you heard from Ron and Doris ?
Not in a while , no .
They are now living in Rhode Island .
You probably knew that .
Well . yeah .
And she 's teaching at U R I .
yeah .
And it was a very nice letter , because it sounded like she went through very similar things that I did .
You know , I went from Chicago to U C S G to here .
Right .
And it 's just such an intellectual letdown .
Right .
And she went from Penn , %um To Columbia . to Columbia to U R I .
Well Columbia 's okay .
yeah .
And she said the students are just ,
you know , they do n't care ,
and they 're not very good ,
and all of a sudden she 's getting conference papers rejected
and she thinks it 's the affiliation .
yeah .
Because she does n't think the quality of her work has changed .
Now I have n't submitted a conference paper with the Missouri %um , you know , affiliation yet .
Because the last one I submitted , %um , was in the fall ,
and I still had my San Diego affiliation .
yeah .
%um , in fact I 'm still officially on leave .
If anything came up in the next year we could still go back . uh-huh . %uh you know , for Sam .
Wow .
But I think it 's very very very very yeah . unlikely .
yeah .
But at any rate it was nice to hear from her because she said after two years there now , she %um has come to terms with this ,
and yeah . she 's accepted that there 's a lot of good things in Rhode Island .
And , %um , you know , their life is a lot less complicated ,
and she has more time to be a parent .
yeah .
Good .
And she 's just not going to have the same kind of career that she had thought about .
Ron is working as a financial consultant for , %um , Meryl Lynch .
And he
oh .
yeah , he had been doing work for some environmental firm , as a consultant .
uh-huh .
And , it did n't work out .
%um He was changing projects every couple of weeks
and he said he could n't keep on top of it .
He could n't learn the whole new area %mm . that fast each time .
%mm .
%um , and he says he went in and had some tests ,
and he was diagnosed as having attention deficit disorder .
Which you know , given how far he 's gotten , you know , he got his degree at Tufts and all , I found that surprising that for the first time as an adult they 're diagnosing this . %um
%mm . I wonder about it .
But anyway .
yeah ,
but that 's what he said .
And %um
yeah .
He %um
Whatever 's helpful .
Right .
So he found this new job as a financial consultant and seems to be happy with that .
Good .
And then we saw Leo and Julie at Christmas time .
uh-huh .
And they 're doing great .
%um , they had just moved to He 's in New York now , right ? a really nice house in Westchester .
yeah , Good . an older home that you know Julie is of course carving up and making beautiful . %um
uh-huh .
Now she had a job with an architectural group when she first got out to New York ,
and that did n't work out .
She said they had her doing things that she really was n't qualified to do %ah . and that she really did n't feel competent doing .
And , they mutually agreed that she should leave .
And so she was looking for another job .
And , %um , I 'm sure she 'll find one .
She 's so talented .
She may have found one by now . %um
yeah ,
oh yeah .
Amazing ,
yeah .
yeah ,
and so we met , %um , %uh Adrian , their kid , who was three uh-huh . and just a really lovely little boy .
right
yeah
He 's so big .
Well , , Leo 's big . You know ,
he 's got Leo 's genes .
yeah .
yeah .
And %uh Ron and Doris sent us a picture of theirs
and he has Ron 's expressions .
He really looks like Ron .
oh that 's life .
%um , and he looked really big too .
In this picture , he 's three and a half .
yeah .
%huh .
%um , but Leo and Julie just seemed , %um sort of happy with the decisions they 've made .
And
Good .
%um , like every
now is he with a publishing house now ?
Which one is he with .
Yes which one %um
Well I can
yeah
It 's one of these sort of universi- the public university book stuff .
It might be Hard Core Brace .
I 'm not sure .
oh yeah .
I have two friends in publishing .
It may be the other one that just took the job with Hard Core Brace
I do n't remember which one .
yeah .
Anyway , he 's enjoying it and liking it
and they 're doing okay .
yeah
he seems to feel really like he 's doing the right thing
and he is Great still in academic publishing .
My other friend just moved to trade publishing after years in academic publishing
and mhm %um you know . It feels like maybe she made a compromise
but it 's like three times the money as with everything else
so
wow wow
industry and academics %um
Terrible
yeah it 's amazing
and %um You know ages ago I got a card from Liz Gana .
I told you this .
because %uh you showed us her picture .
yeah
yeah
Crazy
%um and I keep thinking maybe I 'd get in touch
but I have n't done it .
and then I saw in the %um Tufts thing that Ginny Totta you know in the alumni thing is living in the
yeah
But %um , guessed what happened .
What ?
%um The %um
Again ?
%um 118.91_120.82_B: Let 's see ,
two weeks ago
I know Sue is going to Rhode Island .
%eh Right .
Right .
Did she see her mom ?
Yes she did .
And ?
Yes she did .
And ?
%um , %um , which we had already anticipated that it was going to happen .
I spoke to her mom on Thursday
%um and I asked her
I said listen
I said %um please come to Shabbat
things have come to a point where I may have to relinquish my , %uh parenting .
%uh would you mind %uh taking her back
and she said no .
She said %uh she 'd be more than happy to .
Really ?
This girl has everything in her dreams you know .
it is as my husband says %uh , %uh al kadir the destiny .
Selema I 'm telling you ,
it is like Allah has just painted the road
and all I had to do was get on it and follow it .
I mean things have been happening that has just scared the heck out of me .
I told mom
I said mom it is when you believe in Allah , when you have faith and know when you truly give your heart to Allah , only Allah can make the way clear for you .
%uh .
I believe that by her birthday she will be living with her mother .
Really ?
mhm mhm .
and is she seem like she 's together enough ?
she 's in a two year program .
She 's in the program now .
She 's doing very well .
When I talked to her I 'm talking to her like I 'm talking to you .
I wrote her a letter and told her
I said I feel like I know you even though I never met you .
They seemed surprised that ,
I mean most women you lose your baby that 's it .
But almighty God is
You never even get a chance to see them again .
That 's true .
That 's true .
But that 's what she had wrote me .
she said it is just awesome to her what is happening .
yup .
mhm .
aw I 've heard of that .
yup .
So Francis
Did she say how she felt about what had happened ?
No .
we have n't really talked about that
but I 'm planning on making a trip down to visit her .
Well , how does Akina feel ?
she 's , very happy about it .
Very ha-
Well did she come home and say I saw her , I look like her or what ?
we talked on the phone
and you know she talked about %um her sisters you know and things
we 've spent the night with her sisters and things
and %um it 's just been quite interesting although when she was in Rhode Island she was very disruptive , %um down there and really caused Francis a lot of stress
and %um Francis was very worried about me because she came home two weeks before you know %um because she just was acting like a total nigger child .
uh-oh !
Hope the research did n't hear that !
uh-oh !
wait
wait
Alita I 'm telling you nobody can handle her but you , okay .
And %um ,
but she was very concerned about me and everything %um because %um the child had told some lies about me and about you .
oh .
oh 296.72_297.91_A: oh no .
And about
oh yeah mhm
oh goodness .
yeah .
That we were abusing ,
that %um you know ,
oh yeah
she did some %eh ,
and it was very , very bad .
My daughter - in - law Barbara got on her case real serious yesterday .
Told her that she could n't talk to Jasmine play with Jasmine because she said she hurt Jasmine 's Jetta you know
and she said that if it was n't for Jetta you know Jasmine 's daddy would n't be
oh she 'd
oh man %uh it was
aw .
You know that has always been very scary to me even after .
I said to Mark oh my god . What 's she going to say
because I knew what she would do if I took her somewhere you know what she would say
and I ,
you know in the climate of today , Yes . people saying something like that .
That well ,
you know that 's
and Francis was very concerned in reference to you know she was in school and things
and she was very , very concerned .
Alita she said this little girl has a serious problem .
She wrote me a letter mhm . you know about her needing a lot of love , a lot of %um help and different things like this ,
but you know you 've heard the saying I 'm sure from your grandmother
the sins of your parents will be waged back at you , %hm . you know ,
%um and again my husband said we were going to give it a month , you know and said he was even going to have to sheik pray over her , you know for the jen .
%hm .
You know , I mean , we 're d- , you know ,
and I think we 're still going to be doing that
but I think he 's at a point now where he 's reserved us of that %um , you know that she may end up going %um to %uh t-
oh well the thing is your whole life has been around her mhm . more or less
mhm . mhm .
I mean it is you know I mean absorbed
mhm . mhm .
where is , you know
mhm %mm .
and you know , I mean
this is a lousy
%eh I truly believe that **Salem**
I do n't think ,
you think she 'll be better with her mother ?
I have no idea .
I really have no idea .
But
%um , but you know the ,
if this does happen and I do believe it may happen , %um you know we will have an agreement , she and I , you know ,
%um she will become the legal guardian and that %um
%uh you know I just want her to understand everything that has happened in the last several years yeah . and things like that .
She needs to be clear about that because this child wo n't be like the other two .
%eh %eh You know , %um Well , she said that she was .
Andre said that she was .
oh yeah .
She was like her two daughters ,
yeah .
mhm .
yeah .
they had the same , maybe just
problems and different ,
she has n't been with her children for ten years .
Her , or her two girls .
%ah .
And they 're twelve and ,
no they 're nine and thirteen or something like that .
yup ,
but she 's working very hard .
She 's trying to become a counselor in this drug program , and things
and she sounds like she 's really trying hard .
and I just believe it 's you know time , you know
and , who would have ever thought it though ,
you know what I mean ?
Does she know that you 're Muslim ?
mhm .
mhm .
uh-huh
yup .
yup .
yup
%um So that 's been my most interesting things in the last three weeks .
oh that 's some deep ,
that 's just too deep .
yup .
yup .
mhm .
yup .
Been very , very , very , heavy .
like mom said she said even if it was going to be in September , she said the little things I can tolerate you know if that happens you know .
But you know I always worried
you know even after you left I said , I just hope Arlita knows that you know I tried my best you know
and Everybody has to keep them , Selema , everybody , everybody You know ,
and I told her
I said you know it 's a shame that you ca n't go no place and I can get a good report on you you know , %um , and by her going to Francis and things , and Francis seeing for herself ,
she was like whoa .
did Francis feel she had changed a lot ?
oh yes .
t- ,
oh yes .
You know , mhm , mhm .
a- ,
%ah .
%um , %um , but you know I feel very at peace about everything .
uh-huh .
I feel very at peace you know .
Well it 's good to hear from Francis who 's had a lot of child-
Yes .
Over six hundred .
oh .
Over six hundred foster children .
oh .
Yes .
mhm .
You know she would 've seen it all .
She called mom to talk to mom
let 's see she bought ,
I met her in Albany
mhm .
and she bought her
%um she caught ,
that was on Friday last Friday
she called mom Monday And talked to mom for two hours
uh-huh .
%mm .
She talked to mom here in Rochester .
oh you 're kidding
I was sick up in Syracuse .
She talked to mom .
something must 've been on her mind .
she told mom
she said she was so concerned that this little girl was going to just get out here cause I was n't going to send back to the school , the Muslim school .
uh-huh .
And she was just really concerned about you know everything . mhm you know . What the possibilities of like
Sure .
Sure .
yep .
mhm .
mhm .
Well you know or luck making a way and making it at ease for you to
Well you know why Allah is doing this .
I 'm going to tell you why
because my daughter - in - law is pregnant again .
oh no !
She said she was going to call you .
She said she was going to call you .
%ah
I said well you call Selema
and you tell her .
I said oh and I do n't have your number in my other phonebook I said .
I said you just call her and tell her
yup she sure is .
oh my goodness .
Goodness .
Wait ,
wait ,
did they do like %uh the same thing they had to do last time ?
No .
You know what ?
That same thing happened to Aliah .
No .
She had to take all that stuff the first time
but then the second time
Nope .
She
yup .
yup .
j- , j- ,
%uh , and mom said ,
I mean Jasmine was about two months old
mom said oh goodness .
%eh , I mean cause Jasmine is not nowhere like my other little babies .
She is not cuddly sweet .
%mm , %mm , no w-
She do n't have time for that %uh .
She does not sit still or lay still for you to change her Pampers .
This little girl moves .
I mean you lay her down on the bed
she gets up
and she runs from ,
well she does n't run
but she crawls real fast .
And she has t- aw
And you 're like okay .
And she 's not a cuddly sweet little thing ,
she ,
and she climbs up the stairs , Selema .
She 's seven months old
and she 's climbing up the stairs .
Climbs down the stairs
and mom said so we found out ,
when did we find out Barbara was pregnant ?
Last week , we found out
and mom told her
mom said , Barbara , Jasmine is just moving
she 's moving out the way too quickly
she just was not a little sweet little cuddly you know ,
no way
%uh lay there let me look at my grandmother kind of thing
No no way
not one bit .
oh oh Amway is probably going to have a rule though I could just
But %uh , yeah ,
it 's still a fairly expensive call
%uh but it 's a lot less expensive if we do it that way than if we actually make my parents in law pay it ,
then it
the Dutch have such high taxes on those
they consider it a luxury to call around the world
so they tax it really high .
Anyway %um
So you guys will be in either the eighteenth or the nineteenth
and you 're going to go to %uh Amsterdam .
Well I would say is once you 're at a hotel uh-huh %um , why do n't you call me at work and let me know where you are ,
and then we can make arrangements that day %um , that I can meet you in Amsterdam .
And maybe I 'll come by , public transport .
It 's probably easier for me to come by public transport in Amsterdam than it is for me to come by car to be honest .
mhm .
The streets are small
and there 's no parking .
So I probably will come by public transport
but I do n't know .
We 'll see where you 're staying
%um
and there 's a lot more for you guys if you want to see stuff
you can see stuff in Amsterdam
and %uh since the days are really long ,
I mean it stays light here till about ten thirty eleven o'clock mhm . at night .
So if you want we can take a ride and go see stuff at night
and I can take you to some places ,
we can %uh go see some stuff .
%um , depends on what you guys want to see .
So you guys should pick out the things you want to see and let me know .
okay
%um and I 'll sit and talk with Anya about some things that maybe we think that it would be neat for you to see .
So if you do n't have any ideas we 'll just put something together for you .
okay .
%um but yeah
but I can pick you up th- ,
you know I 'll probably be there some time around six
and we can like do a quick dinner or something yeah and go see whatever you want to see ,
if you want to stay in Amsterdam that 's fine .
If you want to go %uh off into the countryside somewhere and see a little bit of , echte Holland , real Holland and we can do that too .
Actually I 've been up to Holland before .
Spent about two weeks up there .
yeah .
So %um ,
but that was years and years ago .
With your parents when your father was stationed over here , right ?
yeah .
But we got to see Den Haag and places like that too which we 're obviously not going to see this time .
But %um
has Kim been here before ?
And , an-
No .
oh good .
But then again I 'm not sure that Kim would be interested in seeing Shape Headquarters and you know all that kind of stuff . those military things .
Would you be interested in seeing Shape Headquarters again .
No . Not really .
yeah .
I did n't think so .
Somehow I had this feeling that the military taste had been beaten out of you .
yep .
I 'm ,
the mil- ,
I ca n't say too bad things about the military though .
They still have my goods
and they 'll probably hold them hostage .
And they own my body and soul for like another four years
so I just got to pray that they
oh do they ?
yeah .
I owe four years in active reserve time .
aw great .
Do they do that to everyone ?
Milo , get out of there
yeah -- -- %eh everyone %uh who has n't been like you were
you went through like the thirty six two process .
mhm .
So you do n't have it
but yeah if you just separate normally and you have n't served at least eight years , then you owe it .
And that 's one of those things they just never tell you up front .
No .
They never said anything
I figured there was something like that because
And I was in the inactive reserves the entire time I was in college too .
So .
yeah .
I mean that 's the military .
I have my discharge papers and everything
uh-huh .
and I 've said that yeah I will give a urine sample or a blood sample if they call me back for those , but they 're going to have to pay my trip back to the states . because there 's no bases in Holland and I 'm not going to pay out of my own expenses to go to Germany or something for them .
If they want me they can pay ,
bring me back active duty and pay me for the day if they 're going to drag me off somewhere .
But %uh , first they have to find me .
yeah , that 's the other
it was i- ,
if you 're in another country I mean and you 're not planning on coming back to the U S what are they going to do even if you do n't .
yeah .
Well I mean I 'm still American citizen
and I still would like to be welcome in my own country .
Although g-
%uh I mean if they denied my citizenship and I became a citizen here I probably would n't be a horror either ,
but %uh yeah
right now I mean I do want to keep my American citizenship
so .
I kind of want to
Are you going to become a dual citizen ?
What 's that ?
Are you going to try and become a dual citizen ?
Have dual citizenship ?
You ca n't do that ,
%um , the only way to be a dual citizen is if you 're born in a foreign country
like if I were born in Holland and then had American parents . Then I could be a dual citizen .
But you ca n't
If I would to ask to become a citizen in Holland I would automatically lose my American citizenship .
As far as the Americans are concerned , yeah .
yeah .
The Dutch could care less .
The Dutch would say fine
want to be a dual citizen ,
that 's fine ,
but the Americans as soon as you ask for another citizenship that act of asking for it takes away your American citizenship .
I mean it 's kind of stupid .
yeah .
So I 'm an expatriot .
An American expatriot .
An American living abroad .
I still have to file a tax return .
Do you ?
yeah .
But my first seventy five thousand dollars worth of income is tax free .
Good grief .
As long as I do n't bring it back to the states .
Good grief .
I R S for you , %huh ?
yeah .
oh they want their share .
They want their piece of meat .
But all foreign taxes are deductible ,
and my taxes here are fifty percent of income .
So the taxes here are so much higher that , yeah I would never have to worry about it .
Unless you became C E O of the company then maybe like a thousand dollars would be taxable , right ?
yeah .
Somehow it raises a small amount .
the problem 's going to %uh be Anya 's American salary is taxable here and at fifty percent
so we 're going to owe some money to the Dutch government on her salary .
aw .
Some amount that has to be deducted a certain amount
and the amount we pay the American government is deductible ,
but we 'll still owe some taxes .
Th- ,
see I do n't know how it works .
we 're going to be in need of some sort of accountant do it cause I have no clue how that all works .
They do n't have the Quicken Dutch version ?
yeah .
%ah , you know I would n't trust it because it 's so complicated with this international garbage or else the Turbo Tax with the Dutch modules . that I just would n't trust it .
I do n't know , %eh .
yeah .
So complicated when you 're dealing with a Dutch tax form .
Anya had to read it
and Anya and her father did n't understand the damn thing .
How am I supposed to understand it ?
I 'm really looking forward to moving to Oregon and dealing with ,
Oregon you pay state tax
Washington you do n't .
I 'm looking forward to that cause %uh
yeah
but You 'll be a student
so you ,
I mean you 're
what is your income ?
oh , well
See I think y- , %um ,
it 'll probably be about five thousand dollars the portion of this year that I 'm in Oregon
and then next year it 'll be eleven thousand .
yeah .
But I mean you 're below the poverty line at that level .
yeah .
So I mean any income that y-
Well
But then I 've already made say like fifteen thousand or whatever here in Washington
but
That should be non taxable out of state income .
It should
but you know it 's not going to be a fun tax return year .
I had that when I went into the military .
But then again .
I had Kans- ,
I had to file three taxes .
I had to file Georgia , Kansas yeah and then my federal .
So .
Well , %um actually I think this phone call 's just about to end cause it 's only half an hour ,
but %um
So let 's see .
I 'll give you a call when we arrive in h- ,
or maybe I 'll just call you when we get in Holland just to let you know we 're there ,
so if we get in the eighteenth or the nineteenth and then call you back %um when we get to a hotel or something like that .
okay that 's a great idea .
as soon as you get into Holland and get yourself settled you can call me
and %uh if it 's at night , just call Anya 's parents
okay so
and remember that if you dial in Holland you need to add a zero
so like right now okay it 's one eight one zero area code .
If you dial in Holland , it 's zero one eight one zero . okay in Holland
and then yeah you can just call up
if it 's during the work hours , fine , call me at work .
If not , call Anya 's parents if you do n't have a new phone number for me .
And if you do , I 'll send it by email okay if I get it before this weekend
we 'll email you something
but if you do n't get email then just call Anya 's parents
If we have a phone by then , they 'll be able to give you the number
okay
and just remember to ask for her mother .
and it 's Goode , right
Bode
Bode
Bode as in abode
abode
minus the A
okay
great
and
yeah
and I think %uh %uh it 's not Frau
%uh %ah %uh It 's Mifrau
is
it 's Frau in German
it 's Frau
mhm
and then Dutch it 's Mifrau
I 'll probably never remember that
so hope they wo n't be offended .
nah do n't worry about it .
You can just call her Missus
you can just call her Missus and speak English to her .
she understands
just talk slowly and clearly .
okay
and once you 're in Holland the line will be really clear .
I mean the phones here are pretty good . once you 're in the country .
It 's just these to America
it 's always kind of iffy
So , anyway , how are you doing these days ?
Things are going very well .
I think I had mentioned before %uh , that there 's a company now that I 'm working with %um , %uh , which is very much just myself and Guss .
oh .
And that %um
No , you had n't mentioned that .
%eh , oh , okay .
okay , so %um
%eh you told me that you were leaving the company that you were at ,
and you were entertaining offers .
And , %uh
well it seemed to make sense since I had a client to just kind of set up my own company , of sorts .
%um oh . So things are going extremely well .
So , I had one client who said that he 'd pay me a minimum amount .
You know , he , %uh ,
there would be a minimum amount of work , of about %uh , a day a week for the next two three years . mhm . Which is sufficient to pay all my bills then
so I decided that it would make sense to do this .
%um and , %um , I 've been getting substantially more work than then .
%mm .
So I 'm quite pleased .
Well that 's good .
%um , so I have a bunch of %uh work that I need to do on my flat this year .
I 've been telling you that I needed to do that roof atrium for quite some time .
But , %uh , it should come out this year .
oh , well that 's good .
It should be done in a few months .
oh , yeah
I remember So you talking a little bit about it at one point .
yeah ,
yeah .
So you have no intentions of coming over this way any time soon ?
%um . I do n't see the finances occurring uh-huh , right . for a while .
%um , actually right at the moment finances are not going real well .
But %ah well . I am working on that one .
%uh .
It 's just But %um %uh , %uh , the main reason for that is I had not really anticipated a few expenses that recently came up %ah . %uh , related to a couple of burglaries that I had .
oh , harsh . Harsh .
yeah .
yeah ,
and .
Not a whole lot I can do about that now .
Indeed . Indeed .
have to deal with the situation .
And
So that 's what I 'm doing .
Sounds good .
But %um Anyway , %uh One of the main reasons that I 've been such a pathetic , %uh , correspondent has been work .
I 've actually been doing a lot of it .
oh wow .
And %uh , I turned in my Master 's thesis back in May ,
and I 'm actually presently working on , %um , several , %uh , articles oh , okay . Impressive . from it .
yeah ,
actually it turns out that one thing , one little bit in what I was doing , %uh , is going to turn out to be very important in the end . %uh , from what I had been reading in the literature .
You see the one very annoying thing about all of this , was my advisor has been in France for a year and a half .
yeah .
And this made writing my thesis very annoying because you know there was n't much discussion .
yeah .
yup ,
yup .
But , %um Anyway , I had been kind of telling him that , you know , from my reading of the literature , I thought that this one little alteration I had made in my model was kind of clever and unique .
mhm .
And it made the one type of solution occur , which was seen experimentally ,
but none of the other models %uh , had ?
Yes .
the- ,
I 'm looking at , %um , multi mode lasers .
And one of the things that they find experimentally are what they call anti phased , %uh , states , where if you look at the total intensity uh-huh . of the laser , you get an oscillation which is characterized by one frequency .
Yes .
okay .
if you separate out the different modes of the laser mhm . and look at one of those , you get more than one frequency .
okay .
So what 's happening is that the modes are oscillating out of phase so that they completely mask each other 's Exactly . %hm . oscillations on these other frequencies .
And %uh With a pretty simple model you can find that frequency in a transient ,
but you ca n't find that frequency in a driven , %uh , frequency .
You ca n't find so that it will sustain .
okay .
Yes .
So yeah , that particular frequency according to most models damps out very quickly .
And so you should n't actually really be able to ever see it .
%hm .
The only thing is , that , when you do the experiment you see it .
Got it ,
got it .
I see .
So , %um , I found a simple modification of the original formula , which unfortunately makes the solutions horrendously nasty . And in most cases , %uh , insoluble .
But yeah . it gives a driving term .
oh , okay .
So , it actually creates a situation where you get the right sort of answer , you just ca n't always write it down very easily .
Exactly .
oh wow .
so you 're pushing forward the bounds of theoretical laser , %uh , whatever it is science .
But
which , %um , is kind of interesting considering that that 's not really my thing . . Indeed . Indeed . being an experimentalist , not a theorist .
%um Indeed . oh wow . oh , impressive . But
so are you going to get an article in Nature or something ?
%um , actually , I 'm not sure if we 're shooting for op- ,
I think Optics Letters is probably the one that we 're shooting for , or else , perhaps , though I do n't think it 's quite that significant , would be Phys Rev Letters .
%hm .
But , %uh , we want to write a letter , and then a couple articles .
yeah .
%hm . impressive .
And I do n't know how much you know about scientific literature ,
but letters are much more prestigious than , articles .
oh , okay .
oh , I did n't realize that .
okay .
yeah ,
so that 's why it 's actually a big deal is
I mean , you know , writing a couple of articles based on your Master 's thesis , is , not at all unusual in Physics
and yeah . %uh , it 's the fact that I would be writing a letter that is the impressive part of it all .
And what 's actually kind of interesting is I kept telling Neil that I thought that this was kind of significant .
And Neil kept writing back that I should tone this part of the thesis down that You know , people see the anti phased motion ,
and it 's true
they do in the transients
And I was having a lot of trouble getting across to him that all of the literature has this frequency in the transients Yes . %eh and not driven .
And , %uh , what happened was after I had turned in my thesis but before I saw Neil again , he went to a conference in Rochester and there this was a big issue among the people who were doing this work , was , that their models could n't show this as a driven frequency ,
yet their experiments showed it as a driven frequency .
oh cool .
and so Neil then -- Said oh just a second I -- like a week later came to Bryn Mawr
and he said , hey Lowell , we got to write this up .
Exactly .
And I was like , well I 've been telling you that Neil .
Indeed .
So Cool . Cool . that 's mostly the sort of stuff that I 'm spending a lot of time on now . %um
Well it 'll look good on your C V , your resume .
so you might as well spend the time .
Yes , well ,
%uh , no , it 's definitely worth doing . %um ,
and I would have been spending more time on it if it were n't for %uh dealing with the burglary issues oh yeah but that I 've been dealing with .
So are you still living in that house in the middle of the park .
Yes .
yeah , okay .
yeah .
I mean the thing that i-
this place is incredibly easy to break into if you want to .
oh .
It 's not a question of whether or not , %uh you know , that was easy ,
it was just that no one really knew it was worth breaking into .
Exactly .
Exactly .
yeah .
And so the problem is that now they found out that it 's worth breaking into .
yeah .
And unfortunately .
Well , it 's kind of odd .
They 've stolen very weird things for the most part .
%hm .
as far
yeah
as a .
The first time they broke in , what they stole was just bizarre ,
mostly worthless stuff .
And , %uh %huh the most worthwhile thing as far as monetary value went that they stole was the pre-amplifier of my stereo . Unfortunately , because it 's a nice pre-amplifier ,
it has an off board power supply which they did n't steal , which makes the thing that they **stoled** absolutely worthless .
%huh .
So .
That 's bizarre . Bizarre .
so when they broke in the second time did they steal the %uh offboard amplifier ?
Actually , no ,
all they stole the second time was my bike .
%huh .
Which was actually where the major problem came . Exactly . Exactly . yeah . Is that I suddenly had no transportation .
And so , I then had to go bike hunting and eventually get another bike ,
and %mm . that cost me a lot of time .
yeah .
Exactly .
Because ,
yes
Spending a lot of time hunting for bikes , and nah well . then getting one purchased , and then having to , you know , go get it and things like that .
But , that 's dealt with at least .
And so %uh , that 's yeah at least dealt with .
Now I just have to work on the financial aspects of all of this .
But yeah . yeah .
At least Well that would make sense during the summer %uh according to the stipulations of my fellowship , I can actually earn money during the summer .
