Israelis and Palestinians could begin a marathon round of peace talks as early as Sunday but Israel has not yet said whether it will take part .
Prime Minister Ehud Barak is postponing until Saturday his government 's response to the Palestinian 's proposal for talks .
Correspondent Laurie Cassman reports from Jerusalem that Mr. Barak is under pressure to go ahead with the peace effort .
Prime Minister Barak is to meet with his top ministers involved in the peace process on Saturday night to decide what response to give to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat 's proposal .
The meeting was delayed a day in protest after the brutal killing of an Israeli youth in the West Bank .
The Palestinians have proposed a ten - day non-stop negotiating session to narrow differences over key issues blocking a final peace agreement .
If Israel says yes , the marathon meeting will probably take place in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba just across the border from Israel .
Israeli TV says the Palestinians already are sending an advanced team to Taba to prepare for the meeting .
The talks would come in an awkward moment for Prime Minister Barak who is facing an uphill battle to keep his job .
The latest opinion polls show right wing Likud Party leader Ariel Sharon could easily win the February 6th election .
Prime Minister Barak had hoped for a peace deal to clinch victory .
Ariel Sharon has already said he would not honor Mr. Barak 's compromise proposals .
He says his negotiating position with the Palestinians would be much tougher .
Mr. Sharon 's peace plan would retain Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem and the Golan Heights , which Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 Arab - Israeli war .
The plan would also cut in half the amount of West Bank land Israel is to turn over to the Palestinians .
Mr. Sharon talks of long term interest talks push for a single final peace settlement .

In the Middle East Tuesday a Palestinian was reported shot dead near the West Bank town of Nablus .
In another incident Israeli soldiers fired on the car of a high ranking Roman Catholic church official at a checkpoint in the West Bank , but there were no casualties there .

In the meantime , a disputed area in southern Serbia 's Presavo Valley has reopened to traffic after Serb police and Albanian rebel fighters agreed to dismantle two roadblocks .
A second round of Israeli - Palestinian talks ended Saturday night with no breakthrough .
The two sides have agreed to keep talking .
Led by former Israeli Prime Minister Shimone Peres and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat , the two delegations met for more than two hours .
In Israel the latest opinion polls show hard - liner Ariel Sharon is virtually assured of winning next week 's national election .
The story from Ross Don in Jerusalem .
An opinion poll published in the Jerusalem Post newspaper Wednesday shows that Ariel Sharon , Chairman of the right wing Likud Party , has a commanding 22 - point lead over Prime Minister Ehud Barak .
According to the poll , 49 percent of those interviewed said they would vote for Mr. Sharon while 27 percent would support Mr. Barak .
Another Poll , this one in the Hebrew daily Yudiad Acronod found that Mr. Sharon had a 16 % lead over Mr. Barak .
All such surveys show the gap between the two candidates is widening but that former Prime Minister Shimon Peres , a member of Mr. Barak 's Labour Party , would have a better chance of defeating Mr. Sharon , but despite his poor standing in the opinion polls , Mr. Barak says he has no intention of standing down in favor of Mr. Peres .
The Hebrew daily newspaper Harord says that Mr. Barak 's inner circle of advisors has told him he may have to reconsider his position .

Police in Barcelona , Spain Thursday , arrested two suspected members of the violent Basque separatist group Eta as they were preparing what may have been a car bomb .
Gill Carbohol has more from Madrid .
Police arrested a man and a woman suspected of being members of Eta 's Barcelona Commando Unit before dawn .
They were driving an automobile which had been stolen in a nearby town in September .
The couple had attracted the attention of police as they drove through pre-dawn Barcelona because the car 's license plate was dangling and one of the car doors was ajar .
When they stopped the car police found the woman in the back seat with a package containing between fifteen to twenty kilograms of explosives .
Police also found a gun of the type used in the killings blamed on the Barcelona Commando in the past few months .
In a similar incident in Barcelona just twenty days ago , suspected Eta members who were likewise trying to place a car bomb , killed a city policeman and then got away .
Thursday 's suspects readily identified themselves as members of Eta , although they gave false names .
The man has been positively identified as 37 year old but police could not immediately identify the woman .
Security officials are searching for at least one more member of the Barcelona Commando , which has killed two town councilmen , a former Minister of Health and a policeman in the past few months .
Spanish anti-bombs technicians have been busy this week .
On Wednesday they deactivated explosives placed outside a military installation in Gerona , just north of Barcelona , and on Tuesday Basque Regional Police deactivated a bomb placed in a flowerpot in a cemetery where members of the regional chapter of Spain 's ruling Popular Party had gathered for a commemorative ceremony in honor of one of their town councilmen who had been killed three years ago .
Spanish Prime Minister Jose Marie Akhnar said that it was a miracle that a massacre had not occurred .
Eta has been responsible for killing at least 800 people over the last 32 years in its bid to carve out an independent state from northern Spain and south western France .
Meanwhile the Basque Country Regional Government , which is controlled by the pro-independence but moderate Basque National Party , said it would call regional elections later this year .
Basque Chief Minister Hwank Hosei Bariche has been under intense pressure from the Popular and Socialist Parties to call early elections .
He 's been ruling with the minority governments since Eta 's political wing broke its parliamentary alliance with his party last summer .

The United States and Britain are calling on Libya to accept responsibility for the bombing of a Pan Am jetliner over Lockerbie , Scotland .
They are also calling on Libya to compensate families of those who perished .
In Washington President Bush said nothing can change the suffering and loss caused by the December 1988 attack on Pan Am Flight 103 that killed 270 people , but he welcomed Wednesday 's guilty verdict for one of the two Libyan agents accused in the bombing .
Correspondent Scot Bob reports from our Middle East bureau Libyan dissidents are hailing the verdict while the Libyan government says it will appeal .
A spokesman from the Libyan Foreign Ministry told state television his government accepts the verdict but that it will be appealed .
The official noted Libya 's co-operation in handing over the two suspects and called for the immediate lifting of sanctions .
A Libyan dissident exiled in Egypt Mohammed Fias Jabrel says he is satisfied with the verdict because it proves Libya has committed crimes against innocent people but Mr. Jabrel says he hopes the case is not closed .
I hope that the investigations would continue to bring the real murderers which is of the League of Col. Gaddafi .
He is responsible of the act .
That act will not displace that he did not order it .
270 people died in the 1988 bombing over the Scottish town of Lockerbie .
Libya initially refused to hand over the two suspects but it surrendered them nearly two years ago on condition they be tried in a country other than Britain or the United States .

Pakistan has accused India of threatening the peace process by refusing to issue travel documents to the Hurrriyat leaders .
Senior Indian officials have accused Pakistan of continuing to train and arm Islamic militants despite the ceasefire .
They have expressed disappointment that the ceasefire has failed to reduce violence in Kashmir .
India declared a ceasefire in Kashmir for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and later extended it for another month .
Kashmir has been hit by a Muslim separatist insurgency since 1989 .

A New York Federal Judge says he will allow the alleged confession of a suspect charged in the deadly 1998 bombings of two US embassies in Africa .
Judge Linnard Sand originally threw out Mohammed Rashid Dawood Alawali 's statement because he said police forced his confession , but he changed his mind after new testimonies showed that the suspect waived his right to speak to an attorney after his arrest .
Mr. Alawali and three others are charged with the bombings of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people .
In Camp Side Holland prosecutors urged the court to convict two Libyans of murdering 270 people in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing back in 1988 .

He has from the beginning , at least from the Grand Jury , conceded that he tried to conceal the relationship with Ms. Lewinsky .
He tried to conceal that and we 've acknowledged that that was evasive and misleading , but it 's not obstruction of justice , it 's not intentional falsification .
In return for the admission the prosecutor has brought the Lewinsky case to an end and has dropped any plans to indict Mr. Clinton .
As part of the deal Mr. Clinton will accept the suspension of his law license in Arkansas for five years .

State Department spokesman , Richard Bowcher .
As we 've said all along the government of Libya must take responsibility for the actions of Libyan officials .
That means revealing everything they know about the Lockerbie bombing , paying reparations , a clear declaration acknowledging responsibility for the actions of Libyan officials and clear unambiguous actions which demonstrate the Libyan government understands this responsibility .
But late Wednesday a Libyan Foreign Ministry official said Eee is not to blame for the bombing .
He said and these are his words , `` Libya as a state has no responsibility in this affair . ''

Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have resumed peace talks amid indications that confidence building measures by both sides appear to be easing the violence of the past three months .
As Israeli and Palestinian officials headed for their meeting on the border between Israel and Gaza , Israel 's Foreign Minister said he was cutting short a visit to Paris to return home for an emergency cabinet meeting .
Correspondent Laurie Cassman reports from Jerusalem , the meetings renew hopes for progress toward a final peace deal .
Israeli officials say the aim of the meeting is to stabilize the decline in violence and see about the possibility of progress in peace talks before US President Bill Clinton leaves office on January 20th .
Mr. Clinton made a last ditch effort earlier this month to revive peace talks and possibly clinch a peace agreement in his remaining days at the White House .
Both sides conditionally accepted his framework as a basis for negotiations with the Palestinians listing a number of reservations , but Israel conditioned resuming negotiations on an end to Palestinian attacks against Jewish settlers and soldiers .
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat last week promised Mr. Clinton he would try to curb the violence .
Several top level security talks have led to the easing of Israel 's closure of the West Bank and Gaza .
The fate planned to reduce tensions , also includes resuming Palestinian security cooperation and joint patrols .

A lawyer for one of the two Libyans accused of the Lockerbie Scotland continued to attack the prosecution 's case Wednesday .
He called two of its key witnesses liars and argued that their testimony be rejected .
Oran Comito is at Camp Zeist in the Netherlands .
In his fourth day of closing arguments , defense lawyer Bill Taler spent most of his time trying to discredit two key prosecution witnesses .
Edwin Boje made timers for bombs that were sold to Libya and allegedly used to blow up the plane .
Mr. Taler called him a greedy fantasist who wanted to implicate Libya in order to get a huge financial reward from the FBI .
Mr. Taler says Edwin Boje also lied about his dealings with the East German Stazi who he also sold timers to .
Mr. Boje testified that the timers were different but Mr. Taler claims they were exactly the same ones as the Libyans had .
He says the East Germans could have sold them to Palestinian terrorists who then blew up the plane .
Defense lawyers have said all along that it was Palestinians and not their Libyan clients who bombed Pan Am 103 .
The other witness Mr. Taler tore into was a Libyan double agent known as Jiaka .
Mr. Taler says Jiaka told lies about his client to his American paymasters , the CIA in order to remain on their payroll and eventually to move to the US .
He had sufficient cunning to produce spectacular but ultimately unverifiable stories to the CIA said Mr. Taler .
In short he is a man who tells lies for a living .
Mr. Taler wants the judges , who also serve as the jury , to reject the men 's testimony .
Closing arguments continued Thursday with a lawyer for the second accused expected to make his case .

In Spain the Basque separatist group Eta has claimed responsibility for three killings and various attacks in recent months .
Gill Gabrahall reports from Madrid .
In a communique published in two Basque newspapers The terrorist group ETA said it conducted a series of terrorist attacks since October .
Eta also threatened those who signed an anti-terrorist pact promoted by Spain 's two major political parties .
The Basque terrorist group admitted to killing former Socialist Health Minister Ernest Yuke on November 21st and then in December killing a Catalan town councilman and a busload of police officers .
With the publication of the communique Eta has now admitted to all 23 killings for which it was blamed last year after calling off a fourteen - month truce .
Eta has been blamed for more than 800 deaths in its 33 - year drive for an independent Basque homeland in northern Spain and southern France .
The terrorist group also claimed to have carried out a series of attacks including attempts to kill various journalists , placing a bomb in an elevator at a Basque university and bombing attacks against businesses that failed to pay its so called revolutionary tax .
Eta also threatened members of Spain 's ruling Popular Party and the main opposition Socialists .
In December the two parties signed an anti-terrorism pact to isolate the moderate but pro-independence Basque Nationalist Party or PNB .
The PNB has been ruling the autonomous Basque region of Spain with a minority government since it was abandoned by Eta 's political wing in the summer .
Eta does not want the PNB to cooperate with the two mainstream political parties .
The terrorist group justified its assassination of Socialist Ernest Yuke because he was in favor of stronger ties between his party and the PNB .
The Basque Chief Minister Gwan Jose Ibariche has pledged to call regional elections though Spain 's Socialists and the Popular Party have vowed not to form a regional coalition government with the PNB .

Cuban leader Fidel Castro is setting up a lavish extravaganza on the island nation to welcome the new millennium , one year late for much of the rest of the world .
Many experts contend most of the world was at least technically wrong by bringing in the new millennium with massive celebrations last year .
These experts point out that the Gregorian calendar started in 1 AD and therefore , centuries ' millennia start with a one , not a zero .
They say this makes 2001 the first year of the third millennium .
For those observing the start of 2001 as a true dawn of the twenty - first century , the parties and fireworks are fewer and less elaborate than the 2000 celebrations .
In Cuba though , where President Castro had his country sit out last year 's revelry , they 'll be making up for it as major festivities are set .
Opinion polls in Israel show hard - liner Ariel Sharon widening his lead over Prime Minister Ehud Barak as the country 's February 6th election draws nearer .

Ecuador 's economy is showing strong improvement .
Ecuador 's Central Bank reports a healthy economic recovery with growth in the second trimester of 2.4 percent .
This follows the country 's bold move to dollarize the economy .
VOA 's Greg Flankis reports from Quito , while the plan is working , economists still see some problems ahead .
Driving through the narrow streets of downtown Quito , taxi driver Abdun Mesios has nothing but praise for the dollarization of his country 's economy .
He says things are more stable now and that the transition from the former currency known as the sucre has not been difficult .
He says that people who work with the public are having to make change everyday and so they learned fast how to work with the money from the United States .
When the six month transition ended last month and all transactions in Ecuador moved to the dollar system , many merchants found they were short of change .
Jacqueline , who works in a small shop near Quito 's cathedral , says lack of coins is the biggest problem .
She says it happens all the time and that she loses money because they do n't have enough coins to make change .
The Ecuadorian government has minted coins that resemble US coins in an effort to provide more small change for merchants , but it has taken some time to reach all areas , in small rural communities in the countryside , because not enough dollars have made it into circulation there , but the government and President Gustavo Nobora considers these to be short - term problems and views the overall policy as a grand success .
Most people in the financial community agree .
Economist Maria Delapasvela , who works with the magazine Rabista Hastion says adopting the US dollar has put an end to Ecuador 's crisis atmosphere characterized by runs on banks and other disruptions .
She says the immediate effect of the dollarization has been the stabilization of the economy .
She says 1998 and 1999 were years in which Ecuador suffered the worst economic crisis in its history .
During that time , she notes , the sucre went from just over 6,000 to the dollar to almost 25,000 to the dollar .
Maria Delapasvela says conducting business in Ecuador had become a real challenge as factory and storeowners needed to keep an eye on currency fluctuation almost on an hourly basis in order to plan their purchases and sales .
She says inflation is now on the decline and bank deposits are increasing .
The transition to dollars was eased somewhat by a sharp increase in oil prices in the past year , which allowed oil - producing Ecuador to buy plenty of dollars on the international market , but Maria Delapasvela says now is the time to start thinking about what happens when the situation changes .
She asks what will happen when oil prices go back down and the country can no longer bring in sufficient dollars to sustain its economy .
The Ecuadorian economist says now is the time for the government to implement fiscal reforms and to stimulate competitiveness and diversification in the economy .
She says the Nobora government is rightfully proud of the immediate short - term effects of its dollarization policy , but that it needs to concentrate on the medium and long - term outlook .
She says , unless the government develops a plan soon to address Ecuador 's fundamental structural problems , the use of the US dollar as a medium of exchange will not be enough to keep the country 's economy healthy .
The experiment in Ecuador is being watched closely not only by the United States , which receives a certain benefit from the increased demand for dollars , but by other nations in the region .
The concept of dollarization has been discussed from Argentina to Mexico in the past few years .
Some US economists , in fact , had viewed Ecuador as a poor place to test the idea since its economy is still burdened by heavy external debt and its export sector is relatively undeveloped .
Still , as one observer puts it , officials in some nations may conclude that if dollarization can work here in Ecuador , it can work anywhere .

The Pentagon denies US warships are steering clear of the Suez Canal in the wake of the apparent terrorist bombing of the destroyer Cole in Yemen although none has used the canal , since the attack on the Cole earlier this month .
VOA 's Alex Belida reports security along the Suez is being re-evaluated .
At the same time , US forces in two gulf countries have been put on alert against possible terrorist action .
Pentagon spokesman Ken Baken , says US forces in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have now been placed on threat condition delta , the highest state of alert .
The move ordered Monday , follows the earlier decision to place US forces in Bahrain and Qatar on the same delta status , because of terrorist threats .
US forces in the Yemeni harbor of Aden were elevated to delta immediately following the deadly October 12th terrorist bombing of US destroyer Cole .
Mr. Baken says the heightened alert in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia , affects some 10,000 US military personnel in those two countries .
He says it was ordered because of what he termed credible threats , but he says no targets were specified .
The Pentagon spokesman is meanwhile disputing news reports saying the Defense Department has decided to order US Navy ships to temporarily stop using the Suez Canal out of fear of terrorist attack .
Mr. Baken says no such instructions have been given , but he acknowledges security along the canal is being constantly evaluated .
We are evaluating with the Egyptians .
Obviously , the security situation in the canal , we do that all the time .
So , with the Egyptians we both have a very fundamental interest in keeping the canal secure .
No US ships have transited through the canal since before the October 12th attack on the US destroyer Cole in Aden , but Mr. Baken says no ships were scheduled to make the trip for several weeks .
The badly damaged Cole has been towed out of Aden Harbor and is being loaded aboard a Norwegian owned heavy lift ship called the Blue Merlin .
Mr. Baken , says no decision has yet been made on the route the Blue Merlin will take to return the destroyer to the United States for repairs .

Israelis and Palestinians have taken steps to end three weeks of violence , but have warned of difficulties as the clashes continue .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak says he doubts he can count on Palestinians as partners for peace .
Palestinian officials say Israel needs to remove soldiers from the outskirts of Palestinian cities .
The comments were made as Israelis eased travel restrictions on Palestinians as part of their efforts to end the violence by Friday .
There were sporadic clashes in several Palestinian areas Wednesday , but on a much lesser scale than in previous days .
The US State Department said steps were being taken in the right direction following the emergency summit of leaders earlier this week in Sharm El - Sheikh , Egypt .
Israeli and Palestinian representatives traded charges Wednesday in the first phase of an emergency United Nations General Assembly session on the violence in the Mid East .
VOA correspondent Breck Ardery reports from the United Nations .
The chief Palestinian observer to the United Nations , Nasir Al - Kidwa , told the assembly that Israel has broken occupying and colonial power in Palestinian lands .
Mr. Al - Kidwa said Israel uses savage force against Palestinians and then blames the victims for the violence , but Israeli UN Ambassador Yehud Lancry said the Palestinian Authority is helping to promote the violence by allowing extremists to appear on its radio and television broadcasts .
Mr. Lancry denied Israel has used excessive force saying it has simply protected its citizens .
The Assembly will resume its discussion of Mid East violence on Friday after receiving a report from UN Secretary General Kofi Annan .
Mr. Annan will review the effect of efforts earlier this week at Sharm El - Sheikh , Egypt to end the violence .

VOA correspondent David Gollust of the White House reports .
A trip to the region by Mr. Clinton to convene an emergency summit remains under discussion , although the White House insists no decision has been made .
The White House continues to stress Mr. Clinton 's willingness to make a Middle East trip if it will help diffuse the violence and get the parties back to negotiations .
They say they are still waiting to hear if the leaders will be responsive to unspecified US preconditions for such a trip , but they say no decision has been made to go despite an Israeli television report to the contrary .
The possibility of a Clinton mission to the area has gotten heavy media coverage , but spokesman Jake Seaworth told reporters restoring calm is the central issue and not Mr. Clinton 's travel plans .
Well , the President has spent a lot of time on the phone this weekend and this morning , not just discussing where and when , whether to have a summit , but whether we can break the cycle of violence and ultimately we are going to be focussed on the steps that may involve a trip , that may not involve a trip .
The President 's 15 - minute talk with Mr. Annan who was holding talks in the region also dealt with the tense situation along the Israeli - Lebanese border and this week 's kidnapping of three Israeli soldiers by Hizbullah guerillas .

Local elections took place peacefully across Colombia on Sunday despite violence that had marred the run - up to the elections .
Colombians voted for candidates for governors , mayors and town council members , many of them independents challenging the two traditional political parties .
Vordis Navaro reports from the capital Bogota .
The voting comes after several weeks of increased tensions with 21 candidates killed and more than 100 withdrawing from the elections citing intimidation .
During the past week alone , both rebel and paramilitary groups kidnapped eight political officials or candidates .
The two to influence the democratic process .
The government launched a massive security operation to counter the violence .
Some 150,000 soldiers and police were deployed across the country to stop any possible disruptions .
Voters were being checked before being allowed to enter the voting areas and police were patrolling around polling stations .
The security measures seem to have worked .
Polls closed a few incidents of trouble reported .
For the first time ever some Colombians voted in a zone under the control of the leftist insurgents waging a 36 - year - old war on the state .
The Colombian rebels considered the political system illegitimate but the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia or Farc allowed the elections to proceed nevertheless .
However , charges that the leftist rebels stole ballots caused election officials to void voting in one of the five Farc - controlled areas and the mayoral candidate openly backed by the Farc in the rebel stronghold of lost to an independent candidate .
The nationwide local elections are a test for Colombians ' two traditional parties the Liberals and the Conservatives .
They are increasingly blamed for Colombia 's woes and many of the candidates who won in major areas are independent of those political parties .
But beyond the thousands of seats up for grabs , leaders say the Colombia 's embattled democratic system is at stake .
Colombia has one of Latin America 's strongest electoral traditions and little history of military coups but fighting between rival paramilitary groups , government troops and rebel groups has left thousands dead and forced millions to flee their homes .

Here in the United States county workers in Los Angeles , California have returned to their jobs as union negotiators continue contract talks with local officials .
VOA 's Michael Sullivan reports that workers are responding to a request from the city 's Roman Catholic archbishop .
More than 40,000 workers were back at their jobs Thursday following a 1 - day walkout that closed social welfare offices and crippled public medical services .
During the work stoppage Wednesday , local residents were unable to register marriages or get documents for a real estate transaction .
People at one records office found no one on duty to help them .
The return to work Thursday came at the urging of Catholic cardinal Roger Mahodi who said the labor dispute was hurting the poor who rely on public services .
In response to his plea , union officials agreed to try to resolve their differences through negotiations .
The back - to - work agreement angered some of the strikers , however , who called the decision a sellout .

It 's time now to look at professional soccer and rugby and how it can be bad for a player 's health .
This is according to two British medical studies .
As we hear now from VOA 's David McClary , lifetime injuries are common and in the case of rugby , increasing .
A study of nearly 300 former British professional soccer players finds that nearly half have suffered the chronic joint disease " osteoarthritis " often as early as age 40 .
Most have the disease in two or more joints .
Nearly one third of those surveyed had surgery at least once since retiring , mostly on knees with knee replacement a common option .
The Coventry University researchers who report the findings in the British Journal of Sports Medicine say anxiety and depression are common among those so injured , possibly as a result of pain and impaired mobility .
A second study in the same journal finds that injuries among Rugby Union players have nearly doubled since the sport became professional five years ago , from 27 % to 47 % .
The Scottish researchers say one possible explanation is the use of padded equipment .
They suggest it gives a false sense of security causing more aggressive play .

President Clinton is criticizing a proposal to open up food and medicine sales to Cuba , but toughen restrictions on travel there .
VOA 's David Swan reports .
The House of Representatives is expected to vote on the measure next week .
Mr. Clinton says he will withhold final judgment until he sees details of the plan , which Members of Congress hammered out Thursday night , but he tells reporters that if the deal was what it appears to be , the lawmakers made a big mistake .
It looks like it eases the embargo on food and medicine , but it probably does n't very much because it does n't provide any financing credits , which we give to other poor countries , whereas it definitely restricts the ability of the executive branch to increase people - to - people contacts between Americans and Cubans .
The agreement which is part of a larger foreign bill , came after more than a year of political warfare and bargaining over the always sensitive subject of Cuba .
The measure would allow American food and medicine to be sold there for the first time in close to 40 years .
It also applies to four other nations where trade has been restricted , Iran , Sudan , Libya and North Korea , but Cuban - American House Members who fiercely oppose anything that might ease pressure on President Castro demanded concessions .
So , as Mr. Clinton noted , the plan bars American banks from financing the food sales , which means Havana would have to pay cash or obtain credits from third countries .
Another part of the legislation would tighten restrictions on American travel to Cuba .
The Castro government has already rejected the deal , saying it will not buy anything under these terms .
In contrast , the proposal supporters call it an opening to Cuba and an important shift in policy .
One leading farm group , the American Farm Bureau Federation describes it as a positive first step and much better than current law .
It appears Congress is not prepared to take any bigger steps on the issue this year .

A new and simple blood test may soon be available to help doctors tell which of their diabetic patients is most likely to develop crippling and life - threatening complications .
VOA 's Jessica Berman explains .
Researcher Andrew Levi says scientists have long been puzzled by the question of which diabetics develop complications and why .
We know that the complications are directly related to a couple of things .
One is how long you 've had the diabetes , how well you 've been controlled , but it 's clear that people with the same level of control of their glucose , same duration of the diabetes differ dramatically in their susceptibility to these complications that are so devastating .
Dr. Levi says one third of insulin taking patients ends up with kidney failure and 80 % develop blinding eye disease .
Scientists have suspected there must be something different about the genetic make - up of diabetics who develop complications ; and that difference may have to do with haptoglobin , a protein whose function is to mop up blood vessel destroying free radicals .
The free radicals are released when oxygen carrying red blood cells called haemoglobin die .
Andrew Levi says there are three different types of haptoglobin and he and his colleagues at Israel 's Technion Institute have found that one type of haptoglobin called Type 1 - 1 appears protective against diabetic complications while the other two types do not .
Researchers at Technion Institute led by Dr. Levi have developed a simple blood test to let doctors and patients know who is most likely to develop diabetic complications .

Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak called his cabinet into special session late Wednesday , to discuss what he called a grave escalation of the level of violence in the Palestinian territory .
The meeting came after three Israeli soldiers and at least two Palestinians were killed on the West Bank .
In Washington , acting Israeli Foreign Minister Shalome Ben - Ami called the situation extremely grave .
, let us call it a war or if you prefer , a mini war .
So , this is a war in many senses and the Palestinians are shooting at our soldiers , and therefore we need to address this issue not as a civilian uprising , but as a military confrontation .
At least 160 people have been killed in the past five weeks , most of them Palestinians .
The US Navy has issued a revised timetable of events leading to last week 's deadly bombing of the destroyer USS Cole in the Yemeni port of Aden .
VOA Pentagon correspondent Alex Belida reports , the new timeline raises new questions about how the apparent terrorist attack was carried out .
The Navy now says the blast occurred nearly two hours after the destroyer had moored for refueling in Aden Harbor , not during the mooring operation itself .
Originally Navy officials said a small boat that assisted in securing the ship 's lines or whose movements were masked by the mooring operation pulled aside the Cole and blew up in an apparent suicide attack .
A Navy spokesman , Commander Greg Smith offers no new explanation of the circumstances leading to the blast , saying that is now a matter for criminal investigators .
However , Commander Smith says , the Navy remains firm in its assessment that the explosion was the result of a terrorist attack and not a refueling accident , even though the new time table confirms refueling was underway .
That raises questions about how a single boat could have approached without raising the suspicions of armed guards posted as part of the heightened alert status required for the Cole 's port visit .

One other Major League baseball manager is now looking for a new team to lead .
The Toronto Blue Jays have decided not to renew the contract of Jim Firgossy after the team placed third in the American League Eastern Division for two straight seasons .
Toronto finished with the mediocre 83 and 79 record and Firgossy 's contract expired at the end of the season .

The US Navy now says the USS Cole was being refueled when an explosion ripped through it in Yemen last week , killing 17 .
The revised accounting of the incident was given in a Navy statement Friday raising new questions about how the small boat carrying the explosives was able to get near the ship and set off the blast .
Major League baseball 's National League champion New York Mets fortified their teams ' leadership on Tuesday by resigning Manager Bobby Valentine and General Manager Steve Phillips .
One of the Mets ' owners , Nelson Doubleday told a New York newspaper that Valentine 's contract was for three years at $ 7.5 million and with Phillips was for three years at $ 3 million .
The fifty - year - old Valentine replaced Dallas Green as the Mets ' manager on August 26th , 1996 .
Since then , he has led the team to four consecutive winning seasons , including back - to - back post-season berths and the franchise 's first trip to the World Series in 14 years .
Valentine said he knew he wanted to stay in New York .
We think after the last game when Mike and Fonse and Alan John amongst the others , came in and literally asked me to stay , that I knew at that time , probably could have offered a lot less , that I was going to stay .
Valentine had been under contract through midnight Tuesday , while Phillips was under contract through December .
By resigning Valentine before his contract expired , the Mets avoided a bidding war for his services .
The Cincinnati Reds had expressed an interest in him and the Los Angeles Dodgers , Philadelphia Phillies , and Toronto Blue Jays are also without managers .
In Yemen , a bomb threat has forced the tightening of security at the hotel housing US investigators probing the attack on the USS Cole .

Israeli helicopter gunships were pressed into service Wednesday , as gun battles with Palestinians erupted on the West Bank near Bethlehem and at the border crossing into Gaza .
At least five Palestinian demonstrators and three Israeli soldiers were killed .
Both sides reported many injured .
Against that bloody backdrop , there were diplomatic efforts to call a ceasefire , but after a Washington meeting with US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , acting Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben - Ami said what 's happening is not a civilian uprising as the Palestinians claim , but a military confrontation , a mini war , as he put it .
Palestinian negotiator Sayeb Erekat is expected to meet separately with Mrs. Albright and UN Secretary General Kofi Annan , later this week .
Meanwhile , in the Middle East , former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres met with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat with whom he once shared the Nobel Peace Prize .
VOA 's Laurie Cassman reports there apparently was no breakthrough .
The Peres - Arafat meeting lasted for about two hours , but neither man had any comments on the contents of the discussions .
Earlier in the evening Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said he was sending Mr. Peres with a message to the Palestinian leader to end the violence now .
For his part , Palestinian officials say Mr. Arafat wanted to call on Mr. Peres to get the Israelis to stop the fighting .
The meeting took place after an afternoon and evening of fierce clashes between the Israeli military and Palestinians in several West Bank towns and Gaza .
Three Israeli soldiers and at least half a dozen Palestinians including one policeman were killed in separate clashes .
After an emergency meeting with his security advisors Wednesday night , Prime Minister Barak warned of a tough response if the violence continues .
The Army will act firmly , he says , but without being drawn into adventurism .
Palestinian media says it has been warned to evacuate its broadcasting facility .
Radio says military commanders have provided Mr. Barak with a list of targets , but his word of caution against what he calls adventurism indicates heightened Israeli sensitivity to international accusations of an exaggerated use of force against the Palestinians .
Chief Palestinian negotiator Sayeb Erekat says he was prevented by Israeli security from leaving his home in Jericho because of the fighting there .
Israeli combat helicopters are reported to have hit a hotel and casino in Jericho and a building of the Palestinian Authority .
Mr. Erekat is due to travel to Washington to meet with US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other US officials attempting to win a ceasefire .
Mrs. Albright has already met with Israel 's acting Foreign Minister .

Amnesty International says Israel 's military tactics exhibit a pattern of gross human rights violations that could constitute war crimes .
A London - based human rights organizations says Israel 's use of tanks and helicopters is far out of proportion to the threat posed by Palestinian stone throwers .
Amnesty also criticized Palestinians for attacking Israeli civilians and said the Palestinian Authority is not doing enough to keep children away .

At least 50 people have been wounded in violence during Palestinian funerals in the West Bank and Gaza Strip .
Stone - throwing Palestinians clashed with Israeli soldiers , Saturday as thousands of mourners gathered for burials of four Palestinians killed Friday .
There was also a shoot - out between Palestinian militants and Israeli soldiers late Saturday in the West Bank town of Jeneme .
A leader of the Hezbollah guerillas appeared on television calling on Palestinians to carry out suicide missions against Israel .
There are fears in Israel of a renewed suicide bombing campaign following a suicide bicycle attack against an Israeli military post in the Gaza Strip .
The suicide bomber blew himself up Thursday as his bicycle reached a concrete barrier at the Israeli post .
An Israeli soldier was slightly hurt .
The Islamic Jihad group claimed responsibility for the bombing and said in a statement it would continue the suicide attacks .
The US Senate has passed the bill allowing food and medicine sales to Cuba potentially easing 40 - year - old trade sanctions against the Communist ruled island .
The measure now goes on to President Clinton who said he will sign it .
It allows Cuba to buy food and medicine from the United States for the first time since 1962 , but the bill restricts US financing of such sales and also continues a US travel ban to Cuba .
The bill is meant to ease the trade sanctions , but Cuba says , the financial conditions will make it impossible to buy US food .
Cuba 's Communist Party officials have vowed not to spend one cent on US goods .
President Fidel Castro Wednesday led a massive protest rally in Havana against the bill 's restrictions .
We have more on that story on our dateline segment later in this hour .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is heading to Washington for talks today with President Clinton as deadly clashes continue in the Gaza Strip and West Bank .

Tens of thousands of Serbs have taken to the streets of towns and cities throughout Yugoslavia to celebrate as President - elect Vojislav Kostunica prepares to take office .
Outgoing President Slobodan Milosevic congratulated Mr. Kostunica in a Friday television appearance .
We get the latest from VOA correspondent Eve Cornette in Belgrade .
Slobodan Milosevic appeared on Serbian television to announce he had just received official information recognizing the electoral victory of Vojislav Kostunica .
Mr. Milosevic said I believe this decision must be respected and for the first time describes the opposition leader as President - elect , but he said he would not ignore the support of those who did vote for him in election of September 24th and would therefore lead his forces to become a strong opposition party , which he said would win convincingly in the next round of elections .
Mr. Kostunica said he met with Mr. Milosevic and described the talks as positive because he said there was a lot of concern over the peaceful transfer of power .
Yugoslavia 's Army Chief congratulated Mr. Kostunica on his victory and assured television viewers the armed forces would support Yugoslavia 's new leader .
Eve Cornette , VOA News , Belgrade .
President Clinton called Yugoslavia 's popular uprising against Slobodan Milosevic as an extraordinary victory for the Serbian people .
The people there have done an astonishing thing .
This is just as big a blow for freedom as we saw when the Berlin Wall was torn down and when Lech Walensa led the shipyard workers in Poland , when the transformations occurred in all these other former communist countries , and it reverses a ten - year effort .
It is an extraordinary day .
Mr. Clinton pledged Friday that the United States and its allies would work together to lift sanctions to bring Yugoslavia out of isolation .
The European community wants to lift sanctions as early as Monday .
President Clinton has met with the highest - ranking North Korean official ever to visit the United States .
US officials described the one - hour White House meeting , Tuesday between Mr. Clinton and Vice - marshall Jo Myong Rok as very positive , direct and warm .
US officials say the crippled US Navy destroyer Cole is ready to be moved out of Aden back to its homeport of Norfolk , Virginian .
A huge Norwegian transport vessel is to carry the Cole across the Atlantic Ocean .
Following the suspected terrorist attack that killed 17 of the Cole 's sailors , US officials say they are still piecing together evidence they hope will lead to the capture of those responsible .

Ivory Coast 's newly elected President Loran Gbagbo plans to announce his government today .
Mr. Gbagbo has ruled out new elections , but is promising to set up what he calls a broad - based government of national unity .
In Washington , State Department spokesman Phil Reeker said new elections are necessary .
The election October 22nd was failed and fundamentally flawed from the outset due to the exclusion of major party candidates and other machinations leading up to the election .
It 's going to be very important for the voices of the disenfranchised Ivorians to be heard and in that sense the holding of free , fair and inclusive elections will be needed to fully restore the government or put to fore its legitimacy and bring democracy back to .
Fresh violence broke out Thursday between the Gbagbo supporters and backers of rival opposition leader Alassane Ouattara , who was barred from Sunday 's voting .
At least 20 people were killed .
And at one forty - five Universal time you are listening to the Voice of America .
Monkey experiments by an international research team have reversed the brain degeneration typical of Parkinson 's Disease by placing repair proteins inside a disabled AIDS virus .
As we hear from David McAlary , the work is being hailed as a breakthrough in an effort to end Parkinson 's deterioration .
Patients with advanced Parkinson 's are easy to spot .
Degeneration of brain cells or neurons causes them to shake , shuffle and stoop .
The neurons produce less and less of the chemical dopamine that helps relay signals between them .
Dopamine replacement with drugs is the main therapy but it loses effectiveness as the disease progresses .
The next step is transplanting nerve tissue from a fetus to replace the lost dopamine neurons , but that is a costly , risky surgery .
Now a US - Swiss - French group has successfully tested a third approach in monkeys , one that delivers the seeds of a dopamine neuron nourishment protein directly to the brain by injection .
It works as a protectant of the cell so to stop the disease in its tracks .
This is study leader Jeffery Codover of Rush Presbyterian St. Lukes Medical Center in Chicago .
The stimulating brain protein his team used is called GDNF .
Previous studies have shown that GDNF keeps dopamine cells healthy but the problem has been getting it to the brain .
As a defense , the brain 's blood vessels prevent most compounds from entering from the blood stream making it difficult to design a Parkinson 's drug .
To overcome this , Mr. Codover 's team injected a gene to make GDNF right into the monkey 's brains .
To transport the gene , Louisiane University researchers devised an HIV virus stripped of its infecting machinery .
When they injected the altered virus into brains of aging animals with early Parkinson 's it conveyed the attached GDNF gene efficiently , causing dopamine cells to produce the rescue protein on site .
When we delivered GDNF via gene therapy in these aged monkeys we were able to completely reverse all the cellular changes , degenerative changes that are seen in aged monkeys as they relate to Parkinson 's Disease .
The researchers report in the journal Science that the gene therapy also restored coordinated movement in young monkeys in which Parkinson 's was chemically induced .
The benefits of the treatment appear permanent or at least very long - lasting as GDNF genes continually produce the rescue protein .
Mr. Codover says that in people , it would be tested as preventive therapy rather than one for existing symptoms .
Most current clinical trials in Parkinson 's Disease are directed towards symptomatic therapy or towards more advanced patients .
This type of therapy is directed towards more early patients with the emphasis on preventing the progression of the disease rather than replacing lost neurons or more symptomatic types of benefits .
In Stockholm , Sweden Carolinska Institute neuroscientist Lars Olson says if gene delivery works well in people , it would be the best Parkinson 's treatment yet .
It would be better because you would n't have to take medication and you would n't have to do cell transplantation either .
It might be a treatment that you would have to do only once or perhaps a few times during life with the illness .
Mr. Olson says the treatment might also be applied to other brain diseases in which nerve cells degenerate , but he warns of a major hurdle in assuring patients get the proper dose of gene therapy because too much is bad .
If you over - stimulate other neighboring dopamine neurons you might get side effects similar to some of the symptoms seen in schizophrenia for instance .
For use in patients one would like to have a system where the activity of the delivered gene could be controlled .
Jeffery Cooover says he is now testing ways of regulating gene delivery in monkeys .
He hopes to try the procedure in people within five years following US government review .

President Clinton urged Congress Monday to approve 435 million dollars to cut the debt of the world 's poorest countries .
Mr. Clinton said the money is easily within the US ability to pay .
Now let me remind you , we 're talking here about 15,000 of our budget , to lift the burden of debt around the world for years to come .
We 're talking about giving as many as 33 nations a chance for a new beginning and about doing good works that our different faiths demand of us .
Mr. Clinton was joined by several key republican leaders .
Congress has so far failed to provide the full amount that the White House has sought .
United Nations has restored full membership to Yugoslavia , eight years after it lost its voting rights .
VOA 's Breck Ardery reports from the UN .
The General Assembly enthusiastically approved Yugoslavia 's membership by acclamation after receiving a positive recommendation Tuesday , from the UN Security Council .
Assembly President Harry Holkerry made the official announcement .
I therefore declare the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia admitted to membership in the United Nation .
The action ends eight years of isolation of Yugoslavia at the United Nations .
When Yugoslavia began breaking up in 1992 , the General Assembly stripped the nation of its voting rights and ruled Yugoslavia must reapply for UN membership , but it never did until a few days ago when the new democratically elected President of Yugoslavia , Vojislav Kostunica sent a formal request to the United Nations .
US Ambassador Richard Holbrooke said , President Kostunica is to be congratulated .
We congratulate President Kostunica on his leadership in bringing peaceful and democratic change to Yugoslavia .
We congratulate his colleagues in the brave democracy movement that brought the will of the people to power in Belgrade .
President Kostunica has sent a special envoy to the United Nations , Goran Slevonovich , who told the General Assembly the new government in Yugoslavia will work with its neighbors to overcome problems .
To that end , Yugoslavia will be a trustful neighbor and a conscientious member of the international community and will invest its best efforts to promote peace and stability in the region , as well as worldwide .
Mr. Slevonovich also thanked those nations that supported the democratic movement in Yugoslavia in what he called a hard and often uphill battle .

At least six US sailors were killed and more than 30 wounded , Thursday in an apparent suicide attack on a US warship in Yemen .
VOA 's Alex Belida reports from the Pentagon .
The crew of destroyer USS Cole had no reason to expect trouble when the ship pulled into Aden Harbor for a brief routine refueling stop .
The crew , especially saw nothing to fear from a small support boat , sent out by harbor authorities to assist in the mooring process , but that small boat was apparently loaded with explosives and manned by suicide bombers .
As it pulled up to the US destroyer , it blew up , tearing a gaping hole in the Cole 's side .
Admiral Vern Clark , the Chief of Naval Operations , says there had been no threats or warnings ahead of the port call .
He says other recent refueling visits by US ships to Aden had gone off without incident .
Because of general concerns about security in the Mid East , armed guards had been posted on the ship 's deck .
Other standard safety and security measures were also being observed .

President Clinton has signed into law a bill allowing US exports of food and medicine to Cuba .
Nevertheless , Mr. Clinton says he is not satisfied with the measure .
It purports to allow the export of American products to Cuba , yet it makes it virtually impossible for family farmers to arrange the financing that enables such sales to take place .
The new law bars the US government and US banks from providing funds for such exports at the insistence of Cuba 's congressional critics .
The law also prevents Mr. Clinton or his successor from easing restrictions on travel to the Communist country .
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori has issued an order confining all military and police to their barracks .
The President is locked in a power struggle with former intelligence service chief Vladimiro Monticenos .
Mr. Fujimori told reporters late Wednesday , he ordered a complete freeze on movements by the Armed Forces .
President Fujimori has been leading a purge of the military of those loyal to Mr. Monticenos , the former spy master , whose surprise return to Peru on Monday triggered speculation of a possible coup .
Monday , Israeli forces began using helicopter gun ships against Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip who were armed with stones and automatic weapons .
The fighting also spread to Arab villages inside Israel .
In New York , the UN Security Council is holding a closed door meeting on the clashes that began last Thursday after Israeli opposition leader Ariel Sharon made a controversial visit to a site in East Jerusalem sacred to both Muslims and Jews .

The White House announced , Sunday that President Bill Clinton will meet Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Thursday and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak next Sunday .
A White House spokesman said the talks will be held separately and their goal is the ending of violence in the Middle East .
Sporadic clashes continued Sunday in the Gaza Strip and two Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces .
United Nations Human Rights Commissioner Emily Robinson came perilously close to swelling the casualty tolls Sunday when a convoy carrying her through the West Bank was fired upon , but Ross Dunn reports , she escaped unharmed if unhappy .
Mrs. Robinson , the head of the UN Human Rights Commission , got a first hand look at the violence sweeping through the Palestinian territories when she visited the West Bank town of Hebron .
They bulleted a car and a three - vehicle convoy transporting Mrs. Robinson and her staff as she toured one of the major flash points in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
No one was hurt in the shooting but eyewitnesses reported that the UN Human Rights Chief was visibly upset following the incident .
Mrs. Robinson is on a fact - finding mission following complaints by Palestinians that Israeli soldiers have used excessive force in a bid to quell more than six weeks of rioting in the territories .
The shooting of her convoy followed an exchange of gunfire between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian gunmen .
Both Israel and the Palestinians blamed each other for the attack .
The Israeli Army said that the Palestinian gunmen had fired at Mrs. Robinson 's car .
Palestinian police said that militant Jewish settlers in Hebron had fired at the convoy in an Israeli controlled part of the town .
Although the town is under the civil control of the Palestinian Authority , Israeli troops are stationed in the center of Hebron to protect about 400 Jewish settlers .
The settlers worship at a shrine in the heart of the town , holy to both Muslims and Jews , and say they will never leave Hebron despite almost daily attacks in the past six weeks against their homes .

The death toll in Colombia from three days of heavy fighting between soldiers and rebels now stands at more than 100 .
At least 54 soldiers and 50 guerillas have died in clashes around the northeastern cities of Bagado and Dabiara .
Nearly all of the government buildings in those two cities , have been reportedly destroyed .

An Army helicopter went down close to the border with Panama , killing all 22 soldiers on board .
Egypt says runoff elections will be needed for most of the 134 seats contested in last Sunday 's second round of parliamentary voting .
Dave Gavlak reports the opposition is not happy at the idea of having to re-fight so many seats .
Fire bombing and rioting by opposition forces greeted the news of the results of Egypt 's secondary round of parliamentary elections .
Security officials reported that an independent candidate and 25 supporters have been arrested for throwing molitoff cocktails at a vote counting tent in Shakia province , north east of Cairo .
Supporters of another independent in the Nile Delta city of Mansura , attacked homes and threw stones at a police station and a clinic .
Officials said police arrested 40 people after the incidents .
Meanwhile , security forces also arrested 36 supporters of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood after election - related violence erupted in two Nile Delta towns of Abulkabir and Sandup .
Officials said the crowd burnt tires and threw stones .
The officials also charged that some Muslim Brotherhood supporters tried to snatch ballot boxes from judges supervising the elections .
Police said they responded by using water cannons and tear gas .
Election officials say Egypt 's ruling National Democratic Party and independents each won nine parliamentary seats outright .
The Interior Ministry said that the remaining 116 places will be decided in runoff polls on Saturday between the top two finishers for each seat .
The second round of voting took place in nine governorates or administrative districts in the country .
Egypt is carrying out a three phase election because of a recent decision to have judges monitor polling stations in a bid to avoid vote rigging .
The country does not have enough judicial representatives to hold the one - day election .
None of the 27 nominally independent candidates backed by the banned Muslim Brotherhood won seats in the second phase of voting so far .
The Egyptian government has carried out a vigorous crack - down on the Islamist group , which says it takes peaceful means to bring about an Islamic government .
President Hosni Mubarak 's ruling party now controls at least 127 of the 444 parliamentary seats , the Muslim Brotherhood has won six , legal opposition parties control four and other independent candidates have cornered 29 , but these numbers are subject to change as some independent winners pledged their loyalty to President Mubarak 's party .
The Brotherhood has been two candidates in the three stages of voting .
The group has accused the government of harassing and intimidating its candidates and supporters .
The final stage of voting is scheduled for November 8 and includes the capital Cairo .
The new legislature is expected to convene in mid December .

UN Secretary General Kofi Annan appealed to Israel and the Palestinians Tuesday to get back to the bargaining table .
Mr. Annan met with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat , then told reporters the region has suffered enough .
It is not an issue just for Prime Minister Barak and Chairman Arafat .
It is not an issue even for the idea of a role .
It is for all of us .
The population have a role to play , the Palestinian and Israeli to work together to bring these things down .
We all have a responsibility .
Among the other diplomatic contacts Tuesday , both sides met with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and European Union Security Chief Javier Solana .

In what diplomats call a historic move , the United Nations General Assembly , Tuesday approved a resolution which was jointly sponsored by the governments of North Korea and South Korea .
VOA 's Breck Ardery reports from the UN .
The resolution hails last June 's summit meeting between the leaders of the two Koreas and encourages the two sides to lay a solid foundation for the peaceful reunification of Korea .
The resolution was a collaboration involving North Korean Ambassador Li Hyong Chow and Ambassador Sung Chul Yang of South Korea and was co-sponsored by more than 150 other nations .
Support for the resolution was so overwhelming , it was adopted by consensus without a vote .
Ambassador Sung told reporters the resolution was truly historic because it changes the United Nations from an arena of confrontation on Korea to one of co-operation .
In a sense , the reintroduction of the Korean issue to the United Nations signifies a crucially important turn - around of the history in the relationship between South Korea and North Korea .
In other words , this is a new and fresh start toward genuine peace on the Korean Peninsula .
In a statement on the resolution , the North Korean government said the General Assembly 's action indicates firm support of all member states for peace , security , and reunification of Korea .
On the subject of reunification , South Korean Ambassador Sung said that while it is something to aspire to , reunification will probably take years to achieve .

In Egypt , President Hosni Mubarak 's ruling party is claiming victory in the second of three rounds of voting in parliamentary elections , but as VOA 's Scott Bob reports from Cairo , Islamic candidates also made significant gains accompanied by some of the election 's worst violence .
Results from the first two rounds of the elections give Egypt 's ruling National Democratic Party 224 seats in the next assembly .
The Party gained dozens of additional seats Sunday when independent candidates pledged allegiance after winning their races .
These candidates had run as independents after they were passed over in the nomination process .
Meanwhile , candidates of the banned Muslim Brotherhood have won 15 seats in the next parliament ; up from one seat in the last elections five years ago .
Islamist candidates run as independents because Egyptian law prohibits political parties based on religion .
Legal opposition parties including the Waft or Liberal Party and the leftist Stagamo and Nascist parties have won 10 seats so far in the parliament .
The third and final round of voting , including the populous Cairo region , is to begin on Wednesday .
A Muslim Brotherhood candidate from the Nile Delta city of Bandadel Mansoor , who lost his race , Saber Zaher , said the message of Islamists is not to win or lose but to be allowed to participate in the process .
Mr. Zaher said the group wants to prove to the system it has support among the people and that it is wrong to exclude it .
In the run - up to the election , security forces arrested scores of Muslim Brotherhood leaders and hundreds of their sympathizers in an effort to weaken the group , which is viewed as the second strongest political force in the country .
Islamist leaders have also accused security forces of preventing voters from entering polling stations in areas where the opposition is strong .
Four people died and scores were injured in clashes during Saturday 's run - off election in the Nile Delta province of Dekaharia .
One person was killed in the first round of voting .
These elections for the first time are being monitored by the Egyptian judiciary .
An Egyptian court ordered monitoring by the judiciary after the previous elections were ruled unconstitutional because of widespread irregularities and violence in which at least 60 people were killed .

More deadly violence has erupted in the West Bank as Israel 's Prime Minister Ehud Barak failed to form a government of national unity .
As night fell Monday , in the town of Hebron , one Palestinian man was shot dead in an exchange of fire between Palestinian militiamen and Israeli soldiers .
There were also gun battles near Jerusalem .
About 130 people have been killed in more than three weeks of violence , almost all Palestinians .
Monday , Mr. Barak met with Israel 's right wing Likud Party leader Ariel Sharon , to form an emergency unity government to deal with the crisis , but Likud says the two failed to agree on terms .
Middle East expert Mark Gulpan , of Tufts University , says Israel 's fragile coalition politics may stand in the way .
Well , they have made deals with Likud before and Likud is not completely just Sharon , there are moderates within Likud .
So , I think they are capable of making deals with them and that 's not really the problem .
The problem is that the coalition may prevent any possibility of creating a real agreement .
Palestinians have said they will not work with Mr. Sharon , and here in US , Clinton administration spokesman Jake Sewart says the President is still hard at work trying to find a solution for the Middle East crisis .
He has continued to consult with both parties and with leaders in the that we can to try to get the parties to agree on and to move forward on the agreement we reached in Egypt .
Voters in strife - torn Colombia go to the polls today in local elections in the midst of a wave of violence directed by armed groups of the left and the right against many of the candidates .
VOA 's Bill Rodgers has a report from our South American bureau .
Some 23 million Colombians are registered to vote Sunday to elect governors , mayors and other local officials in the South American nation , but the election is taking place in the midst of a rising wave of assassinations , kidnappings and threats against the candidates by leftist guerillas and right - wing paramilitary groups .

In Major League Baseball , the Cincinnati Reds have hired Bob Boon as their new manager , after two other candidates turned down their 650,000 - dollar contract offer .
Boon managed the Kansas City Royals between 1995 and 1997 .
He became the leading candidate after New York Yankees ' third base coach Willy Randoff and Reds ' third base coach Ron Oster refused Cincinnati 's offer .
He replaces Jack McCaine who was fired after the Reds failed to make the post-season despite adding slugger Ken Greffy Junior to their lineup .
Boon said Friday he believes the Reds can compete with any team in their division .
We are not going to be able to compete with several teams in our division from a financial standpoint , but I really believe we can compete with them on the field and that 's where it all comes down to and I 'm just excited to get going .
I wish spring training started tomorrow .
The Reds were the second of six Major League teams to fire their managers , but they were the last to fill the vacancy because of their contract offer .
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has nominated former Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers as the new UN High Commissioner for Refugees .
Mr. Annan praised the record of the 61 - year - old Mr. Lubbers as a government leader , academic and private citizen , saying this made him the right man for the job .
If the General Assembly approves the nomination , Mr. Lubbers will replace Sadako Ogata of Japan on January 1st .
Let 's go to Russia right now Joe , where Vladimir Putin who still remains something of an enigmatic presence in the Russian political scene since he took office at the beginning of the year 2000 , is apparently under siege yet again by revelations that the Russians might possibly have been able to rescue those trapped sailors in the Kursk submarine because some of them evidently survived and it 's apparent that the Russian military suppressed information about what had happened or even distorted it , and was singularly slow in taking up offers of assistance from the Norwegians and the British to help .
What impact do you think this new revelation has on Putin 's political stature ?
Oh , I think it is another step in a diminution of Putin .
I think a number of things have happened ;
His attempt to restore the image of Russia as a great power has , I think backfired generally .
he plunged Milosevic long after it was clear that he was finished .
He has tried to form a strategic relationship with China and India , but this I think has reflected in a much more dramatic way , the weakness of Putin .
After all , you 've got to remember that when the Kursk went down , he was on vacation in the Black Sea and did n't bother even to come back to Moscow , let alone going to Mermonsk at the scene of the disaster and they held back for days before they requested help from Norwegian and British experts and those kind of thing , and I think that there is a sense that it may have contributed to the disaster .
Tom , what 's the thinking in the administration of Putin 's performance so far ?
Very disappointing .
Putin , it 's clear he is no new style Democrat , to put it mildly .
This is a man who still behaves like a KGB operator rather than a ... which , of course , he was .
Yeah , for many , many years at a high level , than a President of a country trying to grapple with democracy .
I think the Clinton administration it was hopeful for Boris Yeltsin and then it got disappointed in Yeltsin and then they thought that reluctantly Mr. Putin was a man that they could do business with , to coin former Prime Minister of Britain Margaret Thatcher 's phrase about Mikhail Gorbachov , but Putin is disappointing the United States government .
They wo n't say that of course , but he has turned out to be a disappointment , and I agree with Joe , I think these latest revelations that 23 sailors on the Kursk survived several days and theoretically might have been saved , had the Russians gotten off the dime and asked for help sooner , I think are devastating .
And David , I think it 's important the views that I think is gaining headway in the Administration and voiced generally is that Putin is a bureaucrat and he runs the government in a bureaucratic kind of way and that it has no chance whatever of rebuilding the Russian economy and the Russian political stability , and that a continuing decline appears to be in the cards for Russia under his leadership .
Right now let 's get an update on the latest world news from VOA 's Dave Deforest .
Well Dick , US officials have launched an investigation into a suspected terrorist attack that killed at least six sailors on a US warship in Yemen .

Defense Secretary William Cohen says if a formal investigation shows it was a terrorist attack .
Dispatch investigators to learn what was responsible for the blast .
Tragedies that test our strength and our resolve occur and have occurred in the past .
We have passed the test and measuring up to those responsibilities and we will pass that test once again today .
Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Vern Clark says the bombers were aboard a small boat that was assisting in the refueling of the destroyer at the port .

I need your help .
In the last days of this campaign , I need you all to work your neighborhoods and talk to your friends and turn out to vote .
And while Democratic candidate Al Gore campaigned in Pennsylvania , President Clinton campaigned for him in Arkansas , another state where the election is too close to call .
If you kind of like having safer streets and a cleaner environment , and knowing your national government is supporting school reforms at work and helping more people get access to health care while we grow the economy , you got to vote for Al Gore and Joe Lieberman .
Mr. Clinton also said that Arkansas could even determine the outcome of the election nationally .
Well Dave , tens of thousands of Serbs have taken to the streets and towns and cities throughout Yugoslavia to celebrate as President - elect Vojislav Kostunica prepares to take office .

He pledged Friday that the United States and its allies would work together to lift sanctions to bring Yugoslavia out of isolation .
The European Community wants to lift sanctions as early as Monday .
Most world leaders have welcomed the ouster of President Slobodan Milosevic .
A popular uprising helped bring him to the Yugoslav presidency just a few days ago , but now Vojislav Kostunica faces the daunting challenge of solidifying power and ending the country 's economic isolation .
VOA correspondent Eve Cornard in Belgrade reports .
The European Union is expected to announce later today an easing of sanctions against Yugoslavia , now the former leader Slobodan Milosevic is out of office .
Yugoslavia is awaiting word that sanctions that have strangled its economy might be partially lifted .
European Union officials say a further lifting of sanctions is likely once Mr. Kostunica has a firm grip on power , but ousted leader Slobodan Milosevic says he plans to remain in Belgrade as a leader of the opposition to Mr. Kostunica , who says he has no plans to bow to Western pressure to extradite the former Yugoslav leader .
Another test of Mr. Kostunica 's political clout will be the meeting of Serbia 's powerful parliament on Monday , where supporters of Mr. Kostunica are expected to push for new election .
The process of purging Milosevic supporters from key institutions and industries is underway .
Kostunica supporters say the most important task now is to gain full control over Yugoslavia 's police and security services , removing any trace of pro-Milosevic officials within the higher ranks , who could still be manipulated by him .

At the United Nations , controversy has broken out over a proposal to drastically tighten sanctions against the Taliban government in Afghanistan .
VOA correspondent Breck Ardery has more on this from the United Nations .
A proposed UN Security Council resolution jointly sponsored by Russia and the United States would tighten economic sanctions against the Taliban and ban all weapon shipments to them .
The proposal goes considerably beyond the existing sanctions , which ban Taliban air flights and freeze international bank accounts held by the Taliban .
Sponsors say the resolution is specifically meant to pressure the Taliban , to abandon its support of terrorism , and to surrender indicted terrorist Osama Bin Laden , but Pakistan 's Ambassador to the United Nations Shamsed Ahmed told reporters his nation is strongly against the resolution and it is the wrong way to fight terrorism .
We abhor terrorism in all its forms and manifestations .
We are with the international community in combating this menace all over the world .
As far as this particular individual is concerned , this is a problem that needs to be resolved between the United States and the government in Afghanistan , which now is Taliban .
Mr. Ahmad says that instead of sanctions , the international community should engage in a dialogue with the Taliban , but Russia 's Ambassador Serge Lavroff says the Taliban leadership does not inspire trust .
The problem is that the Taliban never delivered on a single promise , be this to start the dialogue , be this to stop fighting , be this to treat women and girls properly , or any other demand from the Security Council , in particular to stop the support for terrorism .
An American official told reporters the proposed new sanctions are not meant to harm the Afghan people .
