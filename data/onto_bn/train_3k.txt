Israelis and Palestinians could begin a marathon round of peace talks as early as Sunday but Israel has not yet said whether it will take part .
Prime Minister Ehud Barak is postponing until Saturday his government 's response to the Palestinian 's proposal for talks .
Correspondent Laurie Cassman reports from Jerusalem that Mr. Barak is under pressure to go ahead with the peace effort .
Prime Minister Barak is to meet with his top ministers involved in the peace process on Saturday night to decide what response to give to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat 's proposal .
The meeting was delayed a day in protest after the brutal killing of an Israeli youth in the West Bank .
The Palestinians have proposed a ten - day non-stop negotiating session to narrow differences over key issues blocking a final peace agreement .
If Israel says yes , the marathon meeting will probably take place in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba just across the border from Israel .
Israeli TV says the Palestinians already are sending an advanced team to Taba to prepare for the meeting .
The talks would come in an awkward moment for Prime Minister Barak who is facing an uphill battle to keep his job .
The latest opinion polls show right wing Likud Party leader Ariel Sharon could easily win the February 6th election .
Prime Minister Barak had hoped for a peace deal to clinch victory .
Ariel Sharon has already said he would not honor Mr. Barak 's compromise proposals .
He says his negotiating position with the Palestinians would be much tougher .
Mr. Sharon 's peace plan would retain Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem and the Golan Heights , which Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 Arab - Israeli war .
The plan would also cut in half the amount of West Bank land Israel is to turn over to the Palestinians .
Mr. Sharon talks of long term interest talks push for a single final peace settlement .

In the Middle East Tuesday a Palestinian was reported shot dead near the West Bank town of Nablus .
In another incident Israeli soldiers fired on the car of a high ranking Roman Catholic church official at a checkpoint in the West Bank , but there were no casualties there .

In the meantime , a disputed area in southern Serbia 's Presavo Valley has reopened to traffic after Serb police and Albanian rebel fighters agreed to dismantle two roadblocks .
A second round of Israeli - Palestinian talks ended Saturday night with no breakthrough .
The two sides have agreed to keep talking .
Led by former Israeli Prime Minister Shimone Peres and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat , the two delegations met for more than two hours .
In Israel the latest opinion polls show hard - liner Ariel Sharon is virtually assured of winning next week 's national election .
The story from Ross Don in Jerusalem .
An opinion poll published in the Jerusalem Post newspaper Wednesday shows that Ariel Sharon , Chairman of the right wing Likud Party , has a commanding 22 - point lead over Prime Minister Ehud Barak .
According to the poll , 49 percent of those interviewed said they would vote for Mr. Sharon while 27 percent would support Mr. Barak .
Another Poll , this one in the Hebrew daily Yudiad Acronod found that Mr. Sharon had a 16 % lead over Mr. Barak .
All such surveys show the gap between the two candidates is widening but that former Prime Minister Shimon Peres , a member of Mr. Barak 's Labour Party , would have a better chance of defeating Mr. Sharon , but despite his poor standing in the opinion polls , Mr. Barak says he has no intention of standing down in favor of Mr. Peres .
The Hebrew daily newspaper Harord says that Mr. Barak 's inner circle of advisors has told him he may have to reconsider his position .

Police in Barcelona , Spain Thursday , arrested two suspected members of the violent Basque separatist group Eta as they were preparing what may have been a car bomb .
Gill Carbohol has more from Madrid .
Police arrested a man and a woman suspected of being members of Eta 's Barcelona Commando Unit before dawn .
They were driving an automobile which had been stolen in a nearby town in September .
The couple had attracted the attention of police as they drove through pre-dawn Barcelona because the car 's license plate was dangling and one of the car doors was ajar .
When they stopped the car police found the woman in the back seat with a package containing between fifteen to twenty kilograms of explosives .
Police also found a gun of the type used in the killings blamed on the Barcelona Commando in the past few months .
In a similar incident in Barcelona just twenty days ago , suspected Eta members who were likewise trying to place a car bomb , killed a city policeman and then got away .
Thursday 's suspects readily identified themselves as members of Eta , although they gave false names .
The man has been positively identified as 37 year old but police could not immediately identify the woman .
Security officials are searching for at least one more member of the Barcelona Commando , which has killed two town councilmen , a former Minister of Health and a policeman in the past few months .
Spanish anti-bombs technicians have been busy this week .
On Wednesday they deactivated explosives placed outside a military installation in Gerona , just north of Barcelona , and on Tuesday Basque Regional Police deactivated a bomb placed in a flowerpot in a cemetery where members of the regional chapter of Spain 's ruling Popular Party had gathered for a commemorative ceremony in honor of one of their town councilmen who had been killed three years ago .
Spanish Prime Minister Jose Marie Akhnar said that it was a miracle that a massacre had not occurred .
Eta has been responsible for killing at least 800 people over the last 32 years in its bid to carve out an independent state from northern Spain and south western France .
Meanwhile the Basque Country Regional Government , which is controlled by the pro-independence but moderate Basque National Party , said it would call regional elections later this year .
Basque Chief Minister Hwank Hosei Bariche has been under intense pressure from the Popular and Socialist Parties to call early elections .
He 's been ruling with the minority governments since Eta 's political wing broke its parliamentary alliance with his party last summer .

The United States and Britain are calling on Libya to accept responsibility for the bombing of a Pan Am jetliner over Lockerbie , Scotland .
They are also calling on Libya to compensate families of those who perished .
In Washington President Bush said nothing can change the suffering and loss caused by the December 1988 attack on Pan Am Flight 103 that killed 270 people , but he welcomed Wednesday 's guilty verdict for one of the two Libyan agents accused in the bombing .
Correspondent Scot Bob reports from our Middle East bureau Libyan dissidents are hailing the verdict while the Libyan government says it will appeal .
A spokesman from the Libyan Foreign Ministry told state television his government accepts the verdict but that it will be appealed .
The official noted Libya 's co-operation in handing over the two suspects and called for the immediate lifting of sanctions .
A Libyan dissident exiled in Egypt Mohammed Fias Jabrel says he is satisfied with the verdict because it proves Libya has committed crimes against innocent people but Mr. Jabrel says he hopes the case is not closed .
I hope that the investigations would continue to bring the real murderers which is of the League of Col. Gaddafi .
He is responsible of the act .
That act will not displace that he did not order it .
270 people died in the 1988 bombing over the Scottish town of Lockerbie .
Libya initially refused to hand over the two suspects but it surrendered them nearly two years ago on condition they be tried in a country other than Britain or the United States .

Pakistan has accused India of threatening the peace process by refusing to issue travel documents to the Hurrriyat leaders .
Senior Indian officials have accused Pakistan of continuing to train and arm Islamic militants despite the ceasefire .
They have expressed disappointment that the ceasefire has failed to reduce violence in Kashmir .
India declared a ceasefire in Kashmir for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and later extended it for another month .
Kashmir has been hit by a Muslim separatist insurgency since 1989 .

A New York Federal Judge says he will allow the alleged confession of a suspect charged in the deadly 1998 bombings of two US embassies in Africa .
Judge Linnard Sand originally threw out Mohammed Rashid Dawood Alawali 's statement because he said police forced his confession , but he changed his mind after new testimonies showed that the suspect waived his right to speak to an attorney after his arrest .
Mr. Alawali and three others are charged with the bombings of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people .
In Camp Side Holland prosecutors urged the court to convict two Libyans of murdering 270 people in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing back in 1988 .

He has from the beginning , at least from the Grand Jury , conceded that he tried to conceal the relationship with Ms. Lewinsky .
He tried to conceal that and we 've acknowledged that that was evasive and misleading , but it 's not obstruction of justice , it 's not intentional falsification .
In return for the admission the prosecutor has brought the Lewinsky case to an end and has dropped any plans to indict Mr. Clinton .
As part of the deal Mr. Clinton will accept the suspension of his law license in Arkansas for five years .

State Department spokesman , Richard Bowcher .
As we 've said all along the government of Libya must take responsibility for the actions of Libyan officials .
That means revealing everything they know about the Lockerbie bombing , paying reparations , a clear declaration acknowledging responsibility for the actions of Libyan officials and clear unambiguous actions which demonstrate the Libyan government understands this responsibility .
But late Wednesday a Libyan Foreign Ministry official said Eee is not to blame for the bombing .
He said and these are his words , `` Libya as a state has no responsibility in this affair . ''

Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have resumed peace talks amid indications that confidence building measures by both sides appear to be easing the violence of the past three months .
As Israeli and Palestinian officials headed for their meeting on the border between Israel and Gaza , Israel 's Foreign Minister said he was cutting short a visit to Paris to return home for an emergency cabinet meeting .
Correspondent Laurie Cassman reports from Jerusalem , the meetings renew hopes for progress toward a final peace deal .
Israeli officials say the aim of the meeting is to stabilize the decline in violence and see about the possibility of progress in peace talks before US President Bill Clinton leaves office on January 20th .
Mr. Clinton made a last ditch effort earlier this month to revive peace talks and possibly clinch a peace agreement in his remaining days at the White House .
Both sides conditionally accepted his framework as a basis for negotiations with the Palestinians listing a number of reservations , but Israel conditioned resuming negotiations on an end to Palestinian attacks against Jewish settlers and soldiers .
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat last week promised Mr. Clinton he would try to curb the violence .
Several top level security talks have led to the easing of Israel 's closure of the West Bank and Gaza .
The fate planned to reduce tensions , also includes resuming Palestinian security cooperation and joint patrols .

A lawyer for one of the two Libyans accused of the Lockerbie Scotland continued to attack the prosecution 's case Wednesday .
He called two of its key witnesses liars and argued that their testimony be rejected .
Oran Comito is at Camp Zeist in the Netherlands .
In his fourth day of closing arguments , defense lawyer Bill Taler spent most of his time trying to discredit two key prosecution witnesses .
Edwin Boje made timers for bombs that were sold to Libya and allegedly used to blow up the plane .
Mr. Taler called him a greedy fantasist who wanted to implicate Libya in order to get a huge financial reward from the FBI .
Mr. Taler says Edwin Boje also lied about his dealings with the East German Stazi who he also sold timers to .
Mr. Boje testified that the timers were different but Mr. Taler claims they were exactly the same ones as the Libyans had .
He says the East Germans could have sold them to Palestinian terrorists who then blew up the plane .
Defense lawyers have said all along that it was Palestinians and not their Libyan clients who bombed Pan Am 103 .
The other witness Mr. Taler tore into was a Libyan double agent known as Jiaka .
Mr. Taler says Jiaka told lies about his client to his American paymasters , the CIA in order to remain on their payroll and eventually to move to the US .
He had sufficient cunning to produce spectacular but ultimately unverifiable stories to the CIA said Mr. Taler .
In short he is a man who tells lies for a living .
Mr. Taler wants the judges , who also serve as the jury , to reject the men 's testimony .
Closing arguments continued Thursday with a lawyer for the second accused expected to make his case .

In Spain the Basque separatist group Eta has claimed responsibility for three killings and various attacks in recent months .
Gill Gabrahall reports from Madrid .
In a communique published in two Basque newspapers The terrorist group ETA said it conducted a series of terrorist attacks since October .
Eta also threatened those who signed an anti-terrorist pact promoted by Spain 's two major political parties .
The Basque terrorist group admitted to killing former Socialist Health Minister Ernest Yuke on November 21st and then in December killing a Catalan town councilman and a busload of police officers .
With the publication of the communique Eta has now admitted to all 23 killings for which it was blamed last year after calling off a fourteen - month truce .
Eta has been blamed for more than 800 deaths in its 33 - year drive for an independent Basque homeland in northern Spain and southern France .
The terrorist group also claimed to have carried out a series of attacks including attempts to kill various journalists , placing a bomb in an elevator at a Basque university and bombing attacks against businesses that failed to pay its so called revolutionary tax .
Eta also threatened members of Spain 's ruling Popular Party and the main opposition Socialists .
In December the two parties signed an anti-terrorism pact to isolate the moderate but pro-independence Basque Nationalist Party or PNB .
The PNB has been ruling the autonomous Basque region of Spain with a minority government since it was abandoned by Eta 's political wing in the summer .
Eta does not want the PNB to cooperate with the two mainstream political parties .
The terrorist group justified its assassination of Socialist Ernest Yuke because he was in favor of stronger ties between his party and the PNB .
The Basque Chief Minister Gwan Jose Ibariche has pledged to call regional elections though Spain 's Socialists and the Popular Party have vowed not to form a regional coalition government with the PNB .

Cuban leader Fidel Castro is setting up a lavish extravaganza on the island nation to welcome the new millennium , one year late for much of the rest of the world .
Many experts contend most of the world was at least technically wrong by bringing in the new millennium with massive celebrations last year .
These experts point out that the Gregorian calendar started in 1 AD and therefore , centuries ' millennia start with a one , not a zero .
They say this makes 2001 the first year of the third millennium .
For those observing the start of 2001 as a true dawn of the twenty - first century , the parties and fireworks are fewer and less elaborate than the 2000 celebrations .
In Cuba though , where President Castro had his country sit out last year 's revelry , they 'll be making up for it as major festivities are set .
Opinion polls in Israel show hard - liner Ariel Sharon widening his lead over Prime Minister Ehud Barak as the country 's February 6th election draws nearer .

Ecuador 's economy is showing strong improvement .
Ecuador 's Central Bank reports a healthy economic recovery with growth in the second trimester of 2.4 percent .
This follows the country 's bold move to dollarize the economy .
VOA 's Greg Flankis reports from Quito , while the plan is working , economists still see some problems ahead .
Driving through the narrow streets of downtown Quito , taxi driver Abdun Mesios has nothing but praise for the dollarization of his country 's economy .
He says things are more stable now and that the transition from the former currency known as the sucre has not been difficult .
He says that people who work with the public are having to make change everyday and so they learned fast how to work with the money from the United States .
When the six month transition ended last month and all transactions in Ecuador moved to the dollar system , many merchants found they were short of change .
Jacqueline , who works in a small shop near Quito 's cathedral , says lack of coins is the biggest problem .
She says it happens all the time and that she loses money because they do n't have enough coins to make change .
The Ecuadorian government has minted coins that resemble US coins in an effort to provide more small change for merchants , but it has taken some time to reach all areas , in small rural communities in the countryside , because not enough dollars have made it into circulation there , but the government and President Gustavo Nobora considers these to be short - term problems and views the overall policy as a grand success .
Most people in the financial community agree .
Economist Maria Delapasvela , who works with the magazine Rabista Hastion says adopting the US dollar has put an end to Ecuador 's crisis atmosphere characterized by runs on banks and other disruptions .
She says the immediate effect of the dollarization has been the stabilization of the economy .
She says 1998 and 1999 were years in which Ecuador suffered the worst economic crisis in its history .
During that time , she notes , the sucre went from just over 6,000 to the dollar to almost 25,000 to the dollar .
Maria Delapasvela says conducting business in Ecuador had become a real challenge as factory and storeowners needed to keep an eye on currency fluctuation almost on an hourly basis in order to plan their purchases and sales .
She says inflation is now on the decline and bank deposits are increasing .
The transition to dollars was eased somewhat by a sharp increase in oil prices in the past year , which allowed oil - producing Ecuador to buy plenty of dollars on the international market , but Maria Delapasvela says now is the time to start thinking about what happens when the situation changes .
She asks what will happen when oil prices go back down and the country can no longer bring in sufficient dollars to sustain its economy .
The Ecuadorian economist says now is the time for the government to implement fiscal reforms and to stimulate competitiveness and diversification in the economy .
She says the Nobora government is rightfully proud of the immediate short - term effects of its dollarization policy , but that it needs to concentrate on the medium and long - term outlook .
She says , unless the government develops a plan soon to address Ecuador 's fundamental structural problems , the use of the US dollar as a medium of exchange will not be enough to keep the country 's economy healthy .
The experiment in Ecuador is being watched closely not only by the United States , which receives a certain benefit from the increased demand for dollars , but by other nations in the region .
The concept of dollarization has been discussed from Argentina to Mexico in the past few years .
Some US economists , in fact , had viewed Ecuador as a poor place to test the idea since its economy is still burdened by heavy external debt and its export sector is relatively undeveloped .
Still , as one observer puts it , officials in some nations may conclude that if dollarization can work here in Ecuador , it can work anywhere .

The Pentagon denies US warships are steering clear of the Suez Canal in the wake of the apparent terrorist bombing of the destroyer Cole in Yemen although none has used the canal , since the attack on the Cole earlier this month .
VOA 's Alex Belida reports security along the Suez is being re-evaluated .
At the same time , US forces in two gulf countries have been put on alert against possible terrorist action .
Pentagon spokesman Ken Baken , says US forces in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have now been placed on threat condition delta , the highest state of alert .
The move ordered Monday , follows the earlier decision to place US forces in Bahrain and Qatar on the same delta status , because of terrorist threats .
US forces in the Yemeni harbor of Aden were elevated to delta immediately following the deadly October 12th terrorist bombing of US destroyer Cole .
Mr. Baken says the heightened alert in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia , affects some 10,000 US military personnel in those two countries .
He says it was ordered because of what he termed credible threats , but he says no targets were specified .
The Pentagon spokesman is meanwhile disputing news reports saying the Defense Department has decided to order US Navy ships to temporarily stop using the Suez Canal out of fear of terrorist attack .
Mr. Baken says no such instructions have been given , but he acknowledges security along the canal is being constantly evaluated .
We are evaluating with the Egyptians .
Obviously , the security situation in the canal , we do that all the time .
So , with the Egyptians we both have a very fundamental interest in keeping the canal secure .
No US ships have transited through the canal since before the October 12th attack on the US destroyer Cole in Aden , but Mr. Baken says no ships were scheduled to make the trip for several weeks .
The badly damaged Cole has been towed out of Aden Harbor and is being loaded aboard a Norwegian owned heavy lift ship called the Blue Merlin .
Mr. Baken , says no decision has yet been made on the route the Blue Merlin will take to return the destroyer to the United States for repairs .

Israelis and Palestinians have taken steps to end three weeks of violence , but have warned of difficulties as the clashes continue .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak says he doubts he can count on Palestinians as partners for peace .
Palestinian officials say Israel needs to remove soldiers from the outskirts of Palestinian cities .
The comments were made as Israelis eased travel restrictions on Palestinians as part of their efforts to end the violence by Friday .
There were sporadic clashes in several Palestinian areas Wednesday , but on a much lesser scale than in previous days .
The US State Department said steps were being taken in the right direction following the emergency summit of leaders earlier this week in Sharm El - Sheikh , Egypt .
Israeli and Palestinian representatives traded charges Wednesday in the first phase of an emergency United Nations General Assembly session on the violence in the Mid East .
VOA correspondent Breck Ardery reports from the United Nations .
The chief Palestinian observer to the United Nations , Nasir Al - Kidwa , told the assembly that Israel has broken occupying and colonial power in Palestinian lands .
Mr. Al - Kidwa said Israel uses savage force against Palestinians and then blames the victims for the violence , but Israeli UN Ambassador Yehud Lancry said the Palestinian Authority is helping to promote the violence by allowing extremists to appear on its radio and television broadcasts .
Mr. Lancry denied Israel has used excessive force saying it has simply protected its citizens .
The Assembly will resume its discussion of Mid East violence on Friday after receiving a report from UN Secretary General Kofi Annan .
Mr. Annan will review the effect of efforts earlier this week at Sharm El - Sheikh , Egypt to end the violence .

VOA correspondent David Gollust of the White House reports .
A trip to the region by Mr. Clinton to convene an emergency summit remains under discussion , although the White House insists no decision has been made .
The White House continues to stress Mr. Clinton 's willingness to make a Middle East trip if it will help diffuse the violence and get the parties back to negotiations .
They say they are still waiting to hear if the leaders will be responsive to unspecified US preconditions for such a trip , but they say no decision has been made to go despite an Israeli television report to the contrary .
The possibility of a Clinton mission to the area has gotten heavy media coverage , but spokesman Jake Seaworth told reporters restoring calm is the central issue and not Mr. Clinton 's travel plans .
Well , the President has spent a lot of time on the phone this weekend and this morning , not just discussing where and when , whether to have a summit , but whether we can break the cycle of violence and ultimately we are going to be focussed on the steps that may involve a trip , that may not involve a trip .
The President 's 15 - minute talk with Mr. Annan who was holding talks in the region also dealt with the tense situation along the Israeli - Lebanese border and this week 's kidnapping of three Israeli soldiers by Hizbullah guerillas .

Local elections took place peacefully across Colombia on Sunday despite violence that had marred the run - up to the elections .
Colombians voted for candidates for governors , mayors and town council members , many of them independents challenging the two traditional political parties .
Vordis Navaro reports from the capital Bogota .
The voting comes after several weeks of increased tensions with 21 candidates killed and more than 100 withdrawing from the elections citing intimidation .
During the past week alone , both rebel and paramilitary groups kidnapped eight political officials or candidates .
The two to influence the democratic process .
The government launched a massive security operation to counter the violence .
Some 150,000 soldiers and police were deployed across the country to stop any possible disruptions .
Voters were being checked before being allowed to enter the voting areas and police were patrolling around polling stations .
The security measures seem to have worked .
Polls closed a few incidents of trouble reported .
For the first time ever some Colombians voted in a zone under the control of the leftist insurgents waging a 36 - year - old war on the state .
The Colombian rebels considered the political system illegitimate but the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia or Farc allowed the elections to proceed nevertheless .
However , charges that the leftist rebels stole ballots caused election officials to void voting in one of the five Farc - controlled areas and the mayoral candidate openly backed by the Farc in the rebel stronghold of lost to an independent candidate .
The nationwide local elections are a test for Colombians ' two traditional parties the Liberals and the Conservatives .
They are increasingly blamed for Colombia 's woes and many of the candidates who won in major areas are independent of those political parties .
But beyond the thousands of seats up for grabs , leaders say the Colombia 's embattled democratic system is at stake .
Colombia has one of Latin America 's strongest electoral traditions and little history of military coups but fighting between rival paramilitary groups , government troops and rebel groups has left thousands dead and forced millions to flee their homes .

Here in the United States county workers in Los Angeles , California have returned to their jobs as union negotiators continue contract talks with local officials .
VOA 's Michael Sullivan reports that workers are responding to a request from the city 's Roman Catholic archbishop .
More than 40,000 workers were back at their jobs Thursday following a 1 - day walkout that closed social welfare offices and crippled public medical services .
During the work stoppage Wednesday , local residents were unable to register marriages or get documents for a real estate transaction .
People at one records office found no one on duty to help them .
The return to work Thursday came at the urging of Catholic cardinal Roger Mahodi who said the labor dispute was hurting the poor who rely on public services .
In response to his plea , union officials agreed to try to resolve their differences through negotiations .
The back - to - work agreement angered some of the strikers , however , who called the decision a sellout .

It 's time now to look at professional soccer and rugby and how it can be bad for a player 's health .
This is according to two British medical studies .
As we hear now from VOA 's David McClary , lifetime injuries are common and in the case of rugby , increasing .
A study of nearly 300 former British professional soccer players finds that nearly half have suffered the chronic joint disease " osteoarthritis " often as early as age 40 .
Most have the disease in two or more joints .
Nearly one third of those surveyed had surgery at least once since retiring , mostly on knees with knee replacement a common option .
The Coventry University researchers who report the findings in the British Journal of Sports Medicine say anxiety and depression are common among those so injured , possibly as a result of pain and impaired mobility .
A second study in the same journal finds that injuries among Rugby Union players have nearly doubled since the sport became professional five years ago , from 27 % to 47 % .
The Scottish researchers say one possible explanation is the use of padded equipment .
They suggest it gives a false sense of security causing more aggressive play .

President Clinton is criticizing a proposal to open up food and medicine sales to Cuba , but toughen restrictions on travel there .
VOA 's David Swan reports .
The House of Representatives is expected to vote on the measure next week .
Mr. Clinton says he will withhold final judgment until he sees details of the plan , which Members of Congress hammered out Thursday night , but he tells reporters that if the deal was what it appears to be , the lawmakers made a big mistake .
It looks like it eases the embargo on food and medicine , but it probably does n't very much because it does n't provide any financing credits , which we give to other poor countries , whereas it definitely restricts the ability of the executive branch to increase people - to - people contacts between Americans and Cubans .
The agreement which is part of a larger foreign bill , came after more than a year of political warfare and bargaining over the always sensitive subject of Cuba .
The measure would allow American food and medicine to be sold there for the first time in close to 40 years .
It also applies to four other nations where trade has been restricted , Iran , Sudan , Libya and North Korea , but Cuban - American House Members who fiercely oppose anything that might ease pressure on President Castro demanded concessions .
So , as Mr. Clinton noted , the plan bars American banks from financing the food sales , which means Havana would have to pay cash or obtain credits from third countries .
Another part of the legislation would tighten restrictions on American travel to Cuba .
The Castro government has already rejected the deal , saying it will not buy anything under these terms .
In contrast , the proposal supporters call it an opening to Cuba and an important shift in policy .
One leading farm group , the American Farm Bureau Federation describes it as a positive first step and much better than current law .
It appears Congress is not prepared to take any bigger steps on the issue this year .

A new and simple blood test may soon be available to help doctors tell which of their diabetic patients is most likely to develop crippling and life - threatening complications .
VOA 's Jessica Berman explains .
Researcher Andrew Levi says scientists have long been puzzled by the question of which diabetics develop complications and why .
We know that the complications are directly related to a couple of things .
One is how long you 've had the diabetes , how well you 've been controlled , but it 's clear that people with the same level of control of their glucose , same duration of the diabetes differ dramatically in their susceptibility to these complications that are so devastating .
Dr. Levi says one third of insulin taking patients ends up with kidney failure and 80 % develop blinding eye disease .
Scientists have suspected there must be something different about the genetic make - up of diabetics who develop complications ; and that difference may have to do with haptoglobin , a protein whose function is to mop up blood vessel destroying free radicals .
The free radicals are released when oxygen carrying red blood cells called haemoglobin die .
Andrew Levi says there are three different types of haptoglobin and he and his colleagues at Israel 's Technion Institute have found that one type of haptoglobin called Type 1 - 1 appears protective against diabetic complications while the other two types do not .
Researchers at Technion Institute led by Dr. Levi have developed a simple blood test to let doctors and patients know who is most likely to develop diabetic complications .

Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak called his cabinet into special session late Wednesday , to discuss what he called a grave escalation of the level of violence in the Palestinian territory .
The meeting came after three Israeli soldiers and at least two Palestinians were killed on the West Bank .
In Washington , acting Israeli Foreign Minister Shalome Ben - Ami called the situation extremely grave .
, let us call it a war or if you prefer , a mini war .
So , this is a war in many senses and the Palestinians are shooting at our soldiers , and therefore we need to address this issue not as a civilian uprising , but as a military confrontation .
At least 160 people have been killed in the past five weeks , most of them Palestinians .
The US Navy has issued a revised timetable of events leading to last week 's deadly bombing of the destroyer USS Cole in the Yemeni port of Aden .
VOA Pentagon correspondent Alex Belida reports , the new timeline raises new questions about how the apparent terrorist attack was carried out .
The Navy now says the blast occurred nearly two hours after the destroyer had moored for refueling in Aden Harbor , not during the mooring operation itself .
Originally Navy officials said a small boat that assisted in securing the ship 's lines or whose movements were masked by the mooring operation pulled aside the Cole and blew up in an apparent suicide attack .
A Navy spokesman , Commander Greg Smith offers no new explanation of the circumstances leading to the blast , saying that is now a matter for criminal investigators .
However , Commander Smith says , the Navy remains firm in its assessment that the explosion was the result of a terrorist attack and not a refueling accident , even though the new time table confirms refueling was underway .
That raises questions about how a single boat could have approached without raising the suspicions of armed guards posted as part of the heightened alert status required for the Cole 's port visit .

One other Major League baseball manager is now looking for a new team to lead .
The Toronto Blue Jays have decided not to renew the contract of Jim Firgossy after the team placed third in the American League Eastern Division for two straight seasons .
Toronto finished with the mediocre 83 and 79 record and Firgossy 's contract expired at the end of the season .

The US Navy now says the USS Cole was being refueled when an explosion ripped through it in Yemen last week , killing 17 .
The revised accounting of the incident was given in a Navy statement Friday raising new questions about how the small boat carrying the explosives was able to get near the ship and set off the blast .
Major League baseball 's National League champion New York Mets fortified their teams ' leadership on Tuesday by resigning Manager Bobby Valentine and General Manager Steve Phillips .
One of the Mets ' owners , Nelson Doubleday told a New York newspaper that Valentine 's contract was for three years at $ 7.5 million and with Phillips was for three years at $ 3 million .
The fifty - year - old Valentine replaced Dallas Green as the Mets ' manager on August 26th , 1996 .
Since then , he has led the team to four consecutive winning seasons , including back - to - back post-season berths and the franchise 's first trip to the World Series in 14 years .
Valentine said he knew he wanted to stay in New York .
We think after the last game when Mike and Fonse and Alan John amongst the others , came in and literally asked me to stay , that I knew at that time , probably could have offered a lot less , that I was going to stay .
Valentine had been under contract through midnight Tuesday , while Phillips was under contract through December .
By resigning Valentine before his contract expired , the Mets avoided a bidding war for his services .
The Cincinnati Reds had expressed an interest in him and the Los Angeles Dodgers , Philadelphia Phillies , and Toronto Blue Jays are also without managers .
In Yemen , a bomb threat has forced the tightening of security at the hotel housing US investigators probing the attack on the USS Cole .

Israeli helicopter gunships were pressed into service Wednesday , as gun battles with Palestinians erupted on the West Bank near Bethlehem and at the border crossing into Gaza .
At least five Palestinian demonstrators and three Israeli soldiers were killed .
Both sides reported many injured .
Against that bloody backdrop , there were diplomatic efforts to call a ceasefire , but after a Washington meeting with US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , acting Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben - Ami said what 's happening is not a civilian uprising as the Palestinians claim , but a military confrontation , a mini war , as he put it .
Palestinian negotiator Sayeb Erekat is expected to meet separately with Mrs. Albright and UN Secretary General Kofi Annan , later this week .
Meanwhile , in the Middle East , former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres met with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat with whom he once shared the Nobel Peace Prize .
VOA 's Laurie Cassman reports there apparently was no breakthrough .
The Peres - Arafat meeting lasted for about two hours , but neither man had any comments on the contents of the discussions .
Earlier in the evening Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said he was sending Mr. Peres with a message to the Palestinian leader to end the violence now .
For his part , Palestinian officials say Mr. Arafat wanted to call on Mr. Peres to get the Israelis to stop the fighting .
The meeting took place after an afternoon and evening of fierce clashes between the Israeli military and Palestinians in several West Bank towns and Gaza .
Three Israeli soldiers and at least half a dozen Palestinians including one policeman were killed in separate clashes .
After an emergency meeting with his security advisors Wednesday night , Prime Minister Barak warned of a tough response if the violence continues .
The Army will act firmly , he says , but without being drawn into adventurism .
Palestinian media says it has been warned to evacuate its broadcasting facility .
Radio says military commanders have provided Mr. Barak with a list of targets , but his word of caution against what he calls adventurism indicates heightened Israeli sensitivity to international accusations of an exaggerated use of force against the Palestinians .
Chief Palestinian negotiator Sayeb Erekat says he was prevented by Israeli security from leaving his home in Jericho because of the fighting there .
Israeli combat helicopters are reported to have hit a hotel and casino in Jericho and a building of the Palestinian Authority .
Mr. Erekat is due to travel to Washington to meet with US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other US officials attempting to win a ceasefire .
Mrs. Albright has already met with Israel 's acting Foreign Minister .

Amnesty International says Israel 's military tactics exhibit a pattern of gross human rights violations that could constitute war crimes .
A London - based human rights organizations says Israel 's use of tanks and helicopters is far out of proportion to the threat posed by Palestinian stone throwers .
Amnesty also criticized Palestinians for attacking Israeli civilians and said the Palestinian Authority is not doing enough to keep children away .

At least 50 people have been wounded in violence during Palestinian funerals in the West Bank and Gaza Strip .
Stone - throwing Palestinians clashed with Israeli soldiers , Saturday as thousands of mourners gathered for burials of four Palestinians killed Friday .
There was also a shoot - out between Palestinian militants and Israeli soldiers late Saturday in the West Bank town of Jeneme .
A leader of the Hezbollah guerillas appeared on television calling on Palestinians to carry out suicide missions against Israel .
There are fears in Israel of a renewed suicide bombing campaign following a suicide bicycle attack against an Israeli military post in the Gaza Strip .
The suicide bomber blew himself up Thursday as his bicycle reached a concrete barrier at the Israeli post .
An Israeli soldier was slightly hurt .
The Islamic Jihad group claimed responsibility for the bombing and said in a statement it would continue the suicide attacks .
The US Senate has passed the bill allowing food and medicine sales to Cuba potentially easing 40 - year - old trade sanctions against the Communist ruled island .
The measure now goes on to President Clinton who said he will sign it .
It allows Cuba to buy food and medicine from the United States for the first time since 1962 , but the bill restricts US financing of such sales and also continues a US travel ban to Cuba .
The bill is meant to ease the trade sanctions , but Cuba says , the financial conditions will make it impossible to buy US food .
Cuba 's Communist Party officials have vowed not to spend one cent on US goods .
President Fidel Castro Wednesday led a massive protest rally in Havana against the bill 's restrictions .
We have more on that story on our dateline segment later in this hour .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is heading to Washington for talks today with President Clinton as deadly clashes continue in the Gaza Strip and West Bank .

Tens of thousands of Serbs have taken to the streets of towns and cities throughout Yugoslavia to celebrate as President - elect Vojislav Kostunica prepares to take office .
Outgoing President Slobodan Milosevic congratulated Mr. Kostunica in a Friday television appearance .
We get the latest from VOA correspondent Eve Cornette in Belgrade .
Slobodan Milosevic appeared on Serbian television to announce he had just received official information recognizing the electoral victory of Vojislav Kostunica .
Mr. Milosevic said I believe this decision must be respected and for the first time describes the opposition leader as President - elect , but he said he would not ignore the support of those who did vote for him in election of September 24th and would therefore lead his forces to become a strong opposition party , which he said would win convincingly in the next round of elections .
Mr. Kostunica said he met with Mr. Milosevic and described the talks as positive because he said there was a lot of concern over the peaceful transfer of power .
Yugoslavia 's Army Chief congratulated Mr. Kostunica on his victory and assured television viewers the armed forces would support Yugoslavia 's new leader .
Eve Cornette , VOA News , Belgrade .
President Clinton called Yugoslavia 's popular uprising against Slobodan Milosevic as an extraordinary victory for the Serbian people .
The people there have done an astonishing thing .
This is just as big a blow for freedom as we saw when the Berlin Wall was torn down and when Lech Walensa led the shipyard workers in Poland , when the transformations occurred in all these other former communist countries , and it reverses a ten - year effort .
It is an extraordinary day .
Mr. Clinton pledged Friday that the United States and its allies would work together to lift sanctions to bring Yugoslavia out of isolation .
The European community wants to lift sanctions as early as Monday .
President Clinton has met with the highest - ranking North Korean official ever to visit the United States .
US officials described the one - hour White House meeting , Tuesday between Mr. Clinton and Vice - marshall Jo Myong Rok as very positive , direct and warm .
US officials say the crippled US Navy destroyer Cole is ready to be moved out of Aden back to its homeport of Norfolk , Virginian .
A huge Norwegian transport vessel is to carry the Cole across the Atlantic Ocean .
Following the suspected terrorist attack that killed 17 of the Cole 's sailors , US officials say they are still piecing together evidence they hope will lead to the capture of those responsible .

Ivory Coast 's newly elected President Loran Gbagbo plans to announce his government today .
Mr. Gbagbo has ruled out new elections , but is promising to set up what he calls a broad - based government of national unity .
In Washington , State Department spokesman Phil Reeker said new elections are necessary .
The election October 22nd was failed and fundamentally flawed from the outset due to the exclusion of major party candidates and other machinations leading up to the election .
It 's going to be very important for the voices of the disenfranchised Ivorians to be heard and in that sense the holding of free , fair and inclusive elections will be needed to fully restore the government or put to fore its legitimacy and bring democracy back to .
Fresh violence broke out Thursday between the Gbagbo supporters and backers of rival opposition leader Alassane Ouattara , who was barred from Sunday 's voting .
At least 20 people were killed .
And at one forty - five Universal time you are listening to the Voice of America .
Monkey experiments by an international research team have reversed the brain degeneration typical of Parkinson 's Disease by placing repair proteins inside a disabled AIDS virus .
As we hear from David McAlary , the work is being hailed as a breakthrough in an effort to end Parkinson 's deterioration .
Patients with advanced Parkinson 's are easy to spot .
Degeneration of brain cells or neurons causes them to shake , shuffle and stoop .
The neurons produce less and less of the chemical dopamine that helps relay signals between them .
Dopamine replacement with drugs is the main therapy but it loses effectiveness as the disease progresses .
The next step is transplanting nerve tissue from a fetus to replace the lost dopamine neurons , but that is a costly , risky surgery .
Now a US - Swiss - French group has successfully tested a third approach in monkeys , one that delivers the seeds of a dopamine neuron nourishment protein directly to the brain by injection .
It works as a protectant of the cell so to stop the disease in its tracks .
This is study leader Jeffery Codover of Rush Presbyterian St. Lukes Medical Center in Chicago .
The stimulating brain protein his team used is called GDNF .
Previous studies have shown that GDNF keeps dopamine cells healthy but the problem has been getting it to the brain .
As a defense , the brain 's blood vessels prevent most compounds from entering from the blood stream making it difficult to design a Parkinson 's drug .
To overcome this , Mr. Codover 's team injected a gene to make GDNF right into the monkey 's brains .
To transport the gene , Louisiane University researchers devised an HIV virus stripped of its infecting machinery .
When they injected the altered virus into brains of aging animals with early Parkinson 's it conveyed the attached GDNF gene efficiently , causing dopamine cells to produce the rescue protein on site .
When we delivered GDNF via gene therapy in these aged monkeys we were able to completely reverse all the cellular changes , degenerative changes that are seen in aged monkeys as they relate to Parkinson 's Disease .
The researchers report in the journal Science that the gene therapy also restored coordinated movement in young monkeys in which Parkinson 's was chemically induced .
The benefits of the treatment appear permanent or at least very long - lasting as GDNF genes continually produce the rescue protein .
Mr. Codover says that in people , it would be tested as preventive therapy rather than one for existing symptoms .
Most current clinical trials in Parkinson 's Disease are directed towards symptomatic therapy or towards more advanced patients .
This type of therapy is directed towards more early patients with the emphasis on preventing the progression of the disease rather than replacing lost neurons or more symptomatic types of benefits .
In Stockholm , Sweden Carolinska Institute neuroscientist Lars Olson says if gene delivery works well in people , it would be the best Parkinson 's treatment yet .
It would be better because you would n't have to take medication and you would n't have to do cell transplantation either .
It might be a treatment that you would have to do only once or perhaps a few times during life with the illness .
Mr. Olson says the treatment might also be applied to other brain diseases in which nerve cells degenerate , but he warns of a major hurdle in assuring patients get the proper dose of gene therapy because too much is bad .
If you over - stimulate other neighboring dopamine neurons you might get side effects similar to some of the symptoms seen in schizophrenia for instance .
For use in patients one would like to have a system where the activity of the delivered gene could be controlled .
Jeffery Cooover says he is now testing ways of regulating gene delivery in monkeys .
He hopes to try the procedure in people within five years following US government review .

President Clinton urged Congress Monday to approve 435 million dollars to cut the debt of the world 's poorest countries .
Mr. Clinton said the money is easily within the US ability to pay .
Now let me remind you , we 're talking here about 15,000 of our budget , to lift the burden of debt around the world for years to come .
We 're talking about giving as many as 33 nations a chance for a new beginning and about doing good works that our different faiths demand of us .
Mr. Clinton was joined by several key republican leaders .
Congress has so far failed to provide the full amount that the White House has sought .
United Nations has restored full membership to Yugoslavia , eight years after it lost its voting rights .
VOA 's Breck Ardery reports from the UN .
The General Assembly enthusiastically approved Yugoslavia 's membership by acclamation after receiving a positive recommendation Tuesday , from the UN Security Council .
Assembly President Harry Holkerry made the official announcement .
I therefore declare the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia admitted to membership in the United Nation .
The action ends eight years of isolation of Yugoslavia at the United Nations .
When Yugoslavia began breaking up in 1992 , the General Assembly stripped the nation of its voting rights and ruled Yugoslavia must reapply for UN membership , but it never did until a few days ago when the new democratically elected President of Yugoslavia , Vojislav Kostunica sent a formal request to the United Nations .
US Ambassador Richard Holbrooke said , President Kostunica is to be congratulated .
We congratulate President Kostunica on his leadership in bringing peaceful and democratic change to Yugoslavia .
We congratulate his colleagues in the brave democracy movement that brought the will of the people to power in Belgrade .
President Kostunica has sent a special envoy to the United Nations , Goran Slevonovich , who told the General Assembly the new government in Yugoslavia will work with its neighbors to overcome problems .
To that end , Yugoslavia will be a trustful neighbor and a conscientious member of the international community and will invest its best efforts to promote peace and stability in the region , as well as worldwide .
Mr. Slevonovich also thanked those nations that supported the democratic movement in Yugoslavia in what he called a hard and often uphill battle .

At least six US sailors were killed and more than 30 wounded , Thursday in an apparent suicide attack on a US warship in Yemen .
VOA 's Alex Belida reports from the Pentagon .
The crew of destroyer USS Cole had no reason to expect trouble when the ship pulled into Aden Harbor for a brief routine refueling stop .
The crew , especially saw nothing to fear from a small support boat , sent out by harbor authorities to assist in the mooring process , but that small boat was apparently loaded with explosives and manned by suicide bombers .
As it pulled up to the US destroyer , it blew up , tearing a gaping hole in the Cole 's side .
Admiral Vern Clark , the Chief of Naval Operations , says there had been no threats or warnings ahead of the port call .
He says other recent refueling visits by US ships to Aden had gone off without incident .
Because of general concerns about security in the Mid East , armed guards had been posted on the ship 's deck .
Other standard safety and security measures were also being observed .

President Clinton has signed into law a bill allowing US exports of food and medicine to Cuba .
Nevertheless , Mr. Clinton says he is not satisfied with the measure .
It purports to allow the export of American products to Cuba , yet it makes it virtually impossible for family farmers to arrange the financing that enables such sales to take place .
The new law bars the US government and US banks from providing funds for such exports at the insistence of Cuba 's congressional critics .
The law also prevents Mr. Clinton or his successor from easing restrictions on travel to the Communist country .
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori has issued an order confining all military and police to their barracks .
The President is locked in a power struggle with former intelligence service chief Vladimiro Monticenos .
Mr. Fujimori told reporters late Wednesday , he ordered a complete freeze on movements by the Armed Forces .
President Fujimori has been leading a purge of the military of those loyal to Mr. Monticenos , the former spy master , whose surprise return to Peru on Monday triggered speculation of a possible coup .
Monday , Israeli forces began using helicopter gun ships against Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip who were armed with stones and automatic weapons .
The fighting also spread to Arab villages inside Israel .
In New York , the UN Security Council is holding a closed door meeting on the clashes that began last Thursday after Israeli opposition leader Ariel Sharon made a controversial visit to a site in East Jerusalem sacred to both Muslims and Jews .

The White House announced , Sunday that President Bill Clinton will meet Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Thursday and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak next Sunday .
A White House spokesman said the talks will be held separately and their goal is the ending of violence in the Middle East .
Sporadic clashes continued Sunday in the Gaza Strip and two Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces .
United Nations Human Rights Commissioner Emily Robinson came perilously close to swelling the casualty tolls Sunday when a convoy carrying her through the West Bank was fired upon , but Ross Dunn reports , she escaped unharmed if unhappy .
Mrs. Robinson , the head of the UN Human Rights Commission , got a first hand look at the violence sweeping through the Palestinian territories when she visited the West Bank town of Hebron .
They bulleted a car and a three - vehicle convoy transporting Mrs. Robinson and her staff as she toured one of the major flash points in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
No one was hurt in the shooting but eyewitnesses reported that the UN Human Rights Chief was visibly upset following the incident .
Mrs. Robinson is on a fact - finding mission following complaints by Palestinians that Israeli soldiers have used excessive force in a bid to quell more than six weeks of rioting in the territories .
The shooting of her convoy followed an exchange of gunfire between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian gunmen .
Both Israel and the Palestinians blamed each other for the attack .
The Israeli Army said that the Palestinian gunmen had fired at Mrs. Robinson 's car .
Palestinian police said that militant Jewish settlers in Hebron had fired at the convoy in an Israeli controlled part of the town .
Although the town is under the civil control of the Palestinian Authority , Israeli troops are stationed in the center of Hebron to protect about 400 Jewish settlers .
The settlers worship at a shrine in the heart of the town , holy to both Muslims and Jews , and say they will never leave Hebron despite almost daily attacks in the past six weeks against their homes .

The death toll in Colombia from three days of heavy fighting between soldiers and rebels now stands at more than 100 .
At least 54 soldiers and 50 guerillas have died in clashes around the northeastern cities of Bagado and Dabiara .
Nearly all of the government buildings in those two cities , have been reportedly destroyed .

An Army helicopter went down close to the border with Panama , killing all 22 soldiers on board .
Egypt says runoff elections will be needed for most of the 134 seats contested in last Sunday 's second round of parliamentary voting .
Dave Gavlak reports the opposition is not happy at the idea of having to re-fight so many seats .
Fire bombing and rioting by opposition forces greeted the news of the results of Egypt 's secondary round of parliamentary elections .
Security officials reported that an independent candidate and 25 supporters have been arrested for throwing molitoff cocktails at a vote counting tent in Shakia province , north east of Cairo .
Supporters of another independent in the Nile Delta city of Mansura , attacked homes and threw stones at a police station and a clinic .
Officials said police arrested 40 people after the incidents .
Meanwhile , security forces also arrested 36 supporters of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood after election - related violence erupted in two Nile Delta towns of Abulkabir and Sandup .
Officials said the crowd burnt tires and threw stones .
The officials also charged that some Muslim Brotherhood supporters tried to snatch ballot boxes from judges supervising the elections .
Police said they responded by using water cannons and tear gas .
Election officials say Egypt 's ruling National Democratic Party and independents each won nine parliamentary seats outright .
The Interior Ministry said that the remaining 116 places will be decided in runoff polls on Saturday between the top two finishers for each seat .
The second round of voting took place in nine governorates or administrative districts in the country .
Egypt is carrying out a three phase election because of a recent decision to have judges monitor polling stations in a bid to avoid vote rigging .
The country does not have enough judicial representatives to hold the one - day election .
None of the 27 nominally independent candidates backed by the banned Muslim Brotherhood won seats in the second phase of voting so far .
The Egyptian government has carried out a vigorous crack - down on the Islamist group , which says it takes peaceful means to bring about an Islamic government .
President Hosni Mubarak 's ruling party now controls at least 127 of the 444 parliamentary seats , the Muslim Brotherhood has won six , legal opposition parties control four and other independent candidates have cornered 29 , but these numbers are subject to change as some independent winners pledged their loyalty to President Mubarak 's party .
The Brotherhood has been two candidates in the three stages of voting .
The group has accused the government of harassing and intimidating its candidates and supporters .
The final stage of voting is scheduled for November 8 and includes the capital Cairo .
The new legislature is expected to convene in mid December .

UN Secretary General Kofi Annan appealed to Israel and the Palestinians Tuesday to get back to the bargaining table .
Mr. Annan met with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat , then told reporters the region has suffered enough .
It is not an issue just for Prime Minister Barak and Chairman Arafat .
It is not an issue even for the idea of a role .
It is for all of us .
The population have a role to play , the Palestinian and Israeli to work together to bring these things down .
We all have a responsibility .
Among the other diplomatic contacts Tuesday , both sides met with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and European Union Security Chief Javier Solana .

In what diplomats call a historic move , the United Nations General Assembly , Tuesday approved a resolution which was jointly sponsored by the governments of North Korea and South Korea .
VOA 's Breck Ardery reports from the UN .
The resolution hails last June 's summit meeting between the leaders of the two Koreas and encourages the two sides to lay a solid foundation for the peaceful reunification of Korea .
The resolution was a collaboration involving North Korean Ambassador Li Hyong Chow and Ambassador Sung Chul Yang of South Korea and was co-sponsored by more than 150 other nations .
Support for the resolution was so overwhelming , it was adopted by consensus without a vote .
Ambassador Sung told reporters the resolution was truly historic because it changes the United Nations from an arena of confrontation on Korea to one of co-operation .
In a sense , the reintroduction of the Korean issue to the United Nations signifies a crucially important turn - around of the history in the relationship between South Korea and North Korea .
In other words , this is a new and fresh start toward genuine peace on the Korean Peninsula .
In a statement on the resolution , the North Korean government said the General Assembly 's action indicates firm support of all member states for peace , security , and reunification of Korea .
On the subject of reunification , South Korean Ambassador Sung said that while it is something to aspire to , reunification will probably take years to achieve .

In Egypt , President Hosni Mubarak 's ruling party is claiming victory in the second of three rounds of voting in parliamentary elections , but as VOA 's Scott Bob reports from Cairo , Islamic candidates also made significant gains accompanied by some of the election 's worst violence .
Results from the first two rounds of the elections give Egypt 's ruling National Democratic Party 224 seats in the next assembly .
The Party gained dozens of additional seats Sunday when independent candidates pledged allegiance after winning their races .
These candidates had run as independents after they were passed over in the nomination process .
Meanwhile , candidates of the banned Muslim Brotherhood have won 15 seats in the next parliament ; up from one seat in the last elections five years ago .
Islamist candidates run as independents because Egyptian law prohibits political parties based on religion .
Legal opposition parties including the Waft or Liberal Party and the leftist Stagamo and Nascist parties have won 10 seats so far in the parliament .
The third and final round of voting , including the populous Cairo region , is to begin on Wednesday .
A Muslim Brotherhood candidate from the Nile Delta city of Bandadel Mansoor , who lost his race , Saber Zaher , said the message of Islamists is not to win or lose but to be allowed to participate in the process .
Mr. Zaher said the group wants to prove to the system it has support among the people and that it is wrong to exclude it .
In the run - up to the election , security forces arrested scores of Muslim Brotherhood leaders and hundreds of their sympathizers in an effort to weaken the group , which is viewed as the second strongest political force in the country .
Islamist leaders have also accused security forces of preventing voters from entering polling stations in areas where the opposition is strong .
Four people died and scores were injured in clashes during Saturday 's run - off election in the Nile Delta province of Dekaharia .
One person was killed in the first round of voting .
These elections for the first time are being monitored by the Egyptian judiciary .
An Egyptian court ordered monitoring by the judiciary after the previous elections were ruled unconstitutional because of widespread irregularities and violence in which at least 60 people were killed .

More deadly violence has erupted in the West Bank as Israel 's Prime Minister Ehud Barak failed to form a government of national unity .
As night fell Monday , in the town of Hebron , one Palestinian man was shot dead in an exchange of fire between Palestinian militiamen and Israeli soldiers .
There were also gun battles near Jerusalem .
About 130 people have been killed in more than three weeks of violence , almost all Palestinians .
Monday , Mr. Barak met with Israel 's right wing Likud Party leader Ariel Sharon , to form an emergency unity government to deal with the crisis , but Likud says the two failed to agree on terms .
Middle East expert Mark Gulpan , of Tufts University , says Israel 's fragile coalition politics may stand in the way .
Well , they have made deals with Likud before and Likud is not completely just Sharon , there are moderates within Likud .
So , I think they are capable of making deals with them and that 's not really the problem .
The problem is that the coalition may prevent any possibility of creating a real agreement .
Palestinians have said they will not work with Mr. Sharon , and here in US , Clinton administration spokesman Jake Sewart says the President is still hard at work trying to find a solution for the Middle East crisis .
He has continued to consult with both parties and with leaders in the that we can to try to get the parties to agree on and to move forward on the agreement we reached in Egypt .
Voters in strife - torn Colombia go to the polls today in local elections in the midst of a wave of violence directed by armed groups of the left and the right against many of the candidates .
VOA 's Bill Rodgers has a report from our South American bureau .
Some 23 million Colombians are registered to vote Sunday to elect governors , mayors and other local officials in the South American nation , but the election is taking place in the midst of a rising wave of assassinations , kidnappings and threats against the candidates by leftist guerillas and right - wing paramilitary groups .

In Major League Baseball , the Cincinnati Reds have hired Bob Boon as their new manager , after two other candidates turned down their 650,000 - dollar contract offer .
Boon managed the Kansas City Royals between 1995 and 1997 .
He became the leading candidate after New York Yankees ' third base coach Willy Randoff and Reds ' third base coach Ron Oster refused Cincinnati 's offer .
He replaces Jack McCaine who was fired after the Reds failed to make the post-season despite adding slugger Ken Greffy Junior to their lineup .
Boon said Friday he believes the Reds can compete with any team in their division .
We are not going to be able to compete with several teams in our division from a financial standpoint , but I really believe we can compete with them on the field and that 's where it all comes down to and I 'm just excited to get going .
I wish spring training started tomorrow .
The Reds were the second of six Major League teams to fire their managers , but they were the last to fill the vacancy because of their contract offer .
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has nominated former Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers as the new UN High Commissioner for Refugees .
Mr. Annan praised the record of the 61 - year - old Mr. Lubbers as a government leader , academic and private citizen , saying this made him the right man for the job .
If the General Assembly approves the nomination , Mr. Lubbers will replace Sadako Ogata of Japan on January 1st .
Let 's go to Russia right now Joe , where Vladimir Putin who still remains something of an enigmatic presence in the Russian political scene since he took office at the beginning of the year 2000 , is apparently under siege yet again by revelations that the Russians might possibly have been able to rescue those trapped sailors in the Kursk submarine because some of them evidently survived and it 's apparent that the Russian military suppressed information about what had happened or even distorted it , and was singularly slow in taking up offers of assistance from the Norwegians and the British to help .
What impact do you think this new revelation has on Putin 's political stature ?
Oh , I think it is another step in a diminution of Putin .
I think a number of things have happened ;
His attempt to restore the image of Russia as a great power has , I think backfired generally .
he plunged Milosevic long after it was clear that he was finished .
He has tried to form a strategic relationship with China and India , but this I think has reflected in a much more dramatic way , the weakness of Putin .
After all , you 've got to remember that when the Kursk went down , he was on vacation in the Black Sea and did n't bother even to come back to Moscow , let alone going to Mermonsk at the scene of the disaster and they held back for days before they requested help from Norwegian and British experts and those kind of thing , and I think that there is a sense that it may have contributed to the disaster .
Tom , what 's the thinking in the administration of Putin 's performance so far ?
Very disappointing .
Putin , it 's clear he is no new style Democrat , to put it mildly .
This is a man who still behaves like a KGB operator rather than a ... which , of course , he was .
Yeah , for many , many years at a high level , than a President of a country trying to grapple with democracy .
I think the Clinton administration it was hopeful for Boris Yeltsin and then it got disappointed in Yeltsin and then they thought that reluctantly Mr. Putin was a man that they could do business with , to coin former Prime Minister of Britain Margaret Thatcher 's phrase about Mikhail Gorbachov , but Putin is disappointing the United States government .
They wo n't say that of course , but he has turned out to be a disappointment , and I agree with Joe , I think these latest revelations that 23 sailors on the Kursk survived several days and theoretically might have been saved , had the Russians gotten off the dime and asked for help sooner , I think are devastating .
And David , I think it 's important the views that I think is gaining headway in the Administration and voiced generally is that Putin is a bureaucrat and he runs the government in a bureaucratic kind of way and that it has no chance whatever of rebuilding the Russian economy and the Russian political stability , and that a continuing decline appears to be in the cards for Russia under his leadership .
Right now let 's get an update on the latest world news from VOA 's Dave Deforest .
Well Dick , US officials have launched an investigation into a suspected terrorist attack that killed at least six sailors on a US warship in Yemen .
They say a suicide boat exploded near the USS Cole destroyer as it refueled early Thursday in the Yemeni port of Aden .
The blast tore a huge gap in the ship 's side .
At least 10 other crewmembers are missing more than 30 were injured .
Defense Secretary William Cohen says if a formal investigation shows it was a terrorist attack .
Dispatch investigators to learn what was responsible for the blast .
Tragedies that test our strength and our resolve occur and have occurred in the past .
We have passed the test and measuring up to those responsibilities and we will pass that test once again today .
Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Vern Clark says the bombers were aboard a small boat that was assisting in the refueling of the destroyer at the port .
No one has claimed responsibility .
US military forces around the world have been placed on high alert .
The head of the United Nations Refugee Agency Sadaqal O'Gatta has warned that the agency will become critically weakened unless it receives increased funding .
With just two days left until the US presidential election , both major party candidates campaigned in regions that could go either way .
Republican candidate George W Bush campaigned in Florida , a state with a large population of retired people .
I need your help .
In the last days of this campaign , I need you all to work your neighborhoods and talk to your friends and turn out to vote .
And while Democratic candidate Al Gore campaigned in Pennsylvania , President Clinton campaigned for him in Arkansas , another state where the election is too close to call .
If you kind of like having safer streets and a cleaner environment , and knowing your national government is supporting school reforms at work and helping more people get access to health care while we grow the economy , you got to vote for Al Gore and Joe Lieberman .
Mr. Clinton also said that Arkansas could even determine the outcome of the election nationally .
Well Dave , tens of thousands of Serbs have taken to the streets and towns and cities throughout Yugoslavia to celebrate as President - elect Vojislav Kostunica prepares to take office .
Mr. Kostunica , could be sworn in rather , as early as today .
President Clinton has called Yugoslavia 's popular uprising against Slobodan Milosevic an extraordinary victory for the Serbian people .
He pledged Friday that the United States and its allies would work together to lift sanctions to bring Yugoslavia out of isolation .
The European Community wants to lift sanctions as early as Monday .
Most world leaders have welcomed the ouster of President Slobodan Milosevic .
A popular uprising helped bring him to the Yugoslav presidency just a few days ago , but now Vojislav Kostunica faces the daunting challenge of solidifying power and ending the country 's economic isolation .
VOA correspondent Eve Cornard in Belgrade reports .
The European Union is expected to announce later today an easing of sanctions against Yugoslavia , now the former leader Slobodan Milosevic is out of office .
Yugoslavia is awaiting word that sanctions that have strangled its economy might be partially lifted .
European Union officials say a further lifting of sanctions is likely once Mr. Kostunica has a firm grip on power , but ousted leader Slobodan Milosevic says he plans to remain in Belgrade as a leader of the opposition to Mr. Kostunica , who says he has no plans to bow to Western pressure to extradite the former Yugoslav leader .
Another test of Mr. Kostunica 's political clout will be the meeting of Serbia 's powerful parliament on Monday , where supporters of Mr. Kostunica are expected to push for new election .
The process of purging Milosevic supporters from key institutions and industries is underway .
Kostunica supporters say the most important task now is to gain full control over Yugoslavia 's police and security services , removing any trace of pro-Milosevic officials within the higher ranks , who could still be manipulated by him .

A bullet hit a car in the three - vehicle convoy , transporting Mrs. Robinson and her staff as she toured one of the major flash points in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
Mrs. Robinson is on a fact - finding mission , following complaints by Palestinians that Israeli soldiers have used excessive force in a bid to quell more than six weeks of rioting in the territories .
The shooting of her convoy followed an exchange of gunfire between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian gunmen .
Both Israel and the Palestinians blamed each other for the attack .
The Israeli Army said that the Palestinian gunmen had fired at Mrs. Robinson 's car .

At the United Nations , controversy has broken out over a proposal to drastically tighten sanctions against the Taliban government in Afghanistan .
VOA correspondent Breck Ardery has more on this from the United Nations .
A proposed UN Security Council resolution jointly sponsored by Russia and the United States would tighten economic sanctions against the Taliban and ban all weapon shipments to them .
The proposal goes considerably beyond the existing sanctions , which ban Taliban air flights and freeze international bank accounts held by the Taliban .
Sponsors say the resolution is specifically meant to pressure the Taliban , to abandon its support of terrorism , and to surrender indicted terrorist Osama Bin Laden , but Pakistan 's Ambassador to the United Nations Shamsed Ahmed told reporters his nation is strongly against the resolution and it is the wrong way to fight terrorism .
We abhor terrorism in all its forms and manifestations .
We are with the international community in combating this menace all over the world .
As far as this particular individual is concerned , this is a problem that needs to be resolved between the United States and the government in Afghanistan , which now is Taliban .
Mr. Ahmad says that instead of sanctions , the international community should engage in a dialogue with the Taliban , but Russia 's Ambassador Serge Lavroff says the Taliban leadership does not inspire trust .
The problem is that the Taliban never delivered on a single promise , be this to start the dialogue , be this to stop fighting , be this to treat women and girls properly , or any other demand from the Security Council , in particular to stop the support for terrorism .
An American official told reporters the proposed new sanctions are not meant to harm the Afghan people .
He points out that humanitarian aid is specifically exempt from the sanctions .
He says , the United States is currently the largest single donor of food and relief supplies to the Afghan people and that the aid will continue .
Breck Ardery , VOA News , at the United Nations .
There is a talk of bringing international aid workers back to the refugee camps of West Timor to help thousands of East Timor 's refugees stranded there .
The United Nations and the government of Indonesia are trying to work out a plan to do it , as VOA 's Breck Ardery reports from the UN .
Namibia 's UN Ambassador Martin Angava who recently lead a seven member Security Council delegation to East Timor and to Indonesia , told reporters the plan involves a joint security assessment of conditions in the camps .
What we have proposed and the government of Indonesia is willing to embark on discussions with the UN officials in Jakarta is for UN security experts to be sent to the camps and to assess the situation , and of course , East Timor perhaps as a whole , to assess the situation , together with the Indonesian military and police , and it would be on the basis of their assessment that a decision would then be taken as to whether the humanitarian agents should go back to West Timor or not .
Mr. Angava said the government of Indonesia has increased security in the refugee camps since September .
There are tens of thousands of refugees from East Timor in the camps , but the exact number is in dispute .
International relief workers were evacuated from West Timor after an incident on September 6th , in which three UN aid workers were killed .
The Indonesian government has arrested six people in connection with the murders .
The situation in the refugee camps of West Timor has been an ongoing source of concern for the UN transitional administration in East Timor that is helping to prepare that territory for independence .
Numbers of anti-independence militia groups have been intimidating refugees and even sometimes crossing over into East Timor .
Despite the increased presence of Indonesian security forces in the camps , Ambassador Angava says , there is evidence the militias still have a lot of influence .
Mr. Angava says he and his delegation talked with some refugees who indicated they were reluctant to speak freely , because of the presence of the militias .

Mr. Clark says the attacks were meant to take place last January 3rd amid millennial celebrations and the Muslim observance of Ramadan .
He says the attacks either failed or were thwarted by arrests , but terrorists succeeded in bombing a US ship in Yemen in October .
Mr. Clark says US officials learnt details of the planned attacks during the interrogation of suspected terrorists with links to exiled Saudi millionaire , Osama Bin Laden .
Israeli soldiers have killed another Palestinian in the West Bank as clashes continue between Israelis and Palestinians .
Witnesses in Ramallah say the Palestinian was shot Saturday while working with an electric drill to repair a damaged building .

President Clinton has given Israeli and Palestinian delegates some new proposals that could still open the way to a peace agreement before he leaves office January 20th .
The White House meeting capped a week of closed door Middle East talks in Washington .
VOA 's David Gallust has more .
The White House says the proposals deal with both the substance and procedure for a peace accord and the signs are to report back next week on whether there are grounds to try to conclude an agreement .
A Clinton spokesman described the week of US mediated talks as constructive , but the parties had differing assessments with Palestinian negotiator Sayeb Erekat saying major gaps remain .
It 's been difficult .
The gaps are there .
We exerted maximum efforts and we 'll continue to exert maximum efforts in order to conclude an agreement .
For his part , Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben - Ami seemed more optimistic .
Inevitably differences remain , but I feel that it was a very encouraging round of talks .
Mr. Ben - Ami said the next step might be separate Washington visits by Israeli and Palestinian leaders .

Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak says he is freezing tens of millions of dollars in tax payments to the Palestinian Authority .
Mr. Barak says he is withholding the money until the Palestinians abide by cease - fire agreements .
Earlier Thursday Mr. Barak ruled out an early resumption of peace talks , even with the United States acting as intermediary .
Eve Conette reports from Jerusalem .
Defending what he calls his policy of restraint , Prime Minister Barak says if Israel thought that 2000 Palestinian deaths instead of the 200 now would really solve the situation , we would act in that direction , but Mr. Barak told Israeli Radio , using greater force would lead Israel into a much more complicated situation .
The Israeli Prime Minister says he , Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and President Bill Clinton are not close to holding a 3 - way Middle East peace summit , but he said negotiations should continue if there is a decrease in violence .
His comments came hours after Israeli helicopters attacked offices of Mr. Arafat 's Fatah movement .

The Legend of Bagger Vance directed by Robert Redford is the latest movie to bring the game of golf to the screen and is one of the most popular attractions of theaters in the United States .
Entertainment reporter Chuck Rich discussed this and previous golf films with VOA 's Dave Arlington .
The movies ' The Natural ' and ' Field of Dreams ' brought mystical and nostalgic qualities to baseball and The Legend of Bagger Vance , set during the economic depression over the 1920s and 1930s , does the same thing for golf .
Will Smith plays a caddy who revives the confidence , as well as the skill of a golfer whose glory has faded .
You know I understood everything Will Smith said in films like '' Men in Black '' and '' Independence Day . ''
What was he talking about there ?
Beats the heck out of me .
Seriously , I think golf and many golf films can be whatever you interpret them to be , what the player or the moviegoer decides they 'll be .
Some people consider golf to be a silly and dull game , following a little ball around the course , others , including some filmmakers , view it as a symbol or as a gauge of a person 's philosophy or psychology .
For example in the 1996 movie '' Tin Cup '' with Kevin Costner and Cheech Merrin , what might be an embarrassing experience in one golfer 's past is for him a badge of honor .
Do you have to like golf to like golf movies ?
It helps , but it 's not necessary .
Some filmmakers and performers used golf as a setting for broad comedy with potential appeal both inside and outside of the sport .
The 1996 golf movie '' Happy Gilmore '' starring and co-written by Adam Sandler , placed the temperamental ice hockey player in a professional sport that some people consider refined .
Golf can be a very frustrating game .
So , any golfer I guess would understand that gag in '' Happy Gilmore . ''
And anyone who dislikes or is bored by golf , might appreciate seeing the game played for laughs there .
What is your take on golf movies ?
I only play miniature golf and I do n't watch golf on television .
I think I am one of the people filmmakers are thinking of , when they try to give a golf movie wide appeal , humor , or a love story for example .
One film that 's attracted a lot of golf loving fans over the years is 1980 's '' Caddy Shack '' .
Set at the exclusive Bush Wood country club , it 's about class conflict or as movie advertising sometimes calls it , the snobs versus the flops .
Here is one golfer in '' Caddy Shack '' played by Rodney Dangerfield , bothering another , a judge played by the late Ted Night .
As a comedian , Rodney Dangerfield often says he gets no respect , but were n't the filmmakers really showing their respect for him and his drawing power by casting him in this film ?
I think Dangerfield was a big selling point who attracted a lot of his fans , who include me , to see '' Caddy Shack . ''
I do n't think it 's a very good film , but it 's a popular one and the music in '' Caddy Shack '' got some attention too .
We 're going to finish up our cinematic round of golf with some of that .
Thank you , Chuck .
You 're welcome , Dave .

Three Florida courts are weighing cases that could signally end in the month - long battle for the White House .
Decisions were expected swiftly with the December 12th deadline for Florida to certify its 25 electors , the people who will actually choose the next US President .

I think that what they have consistently said is that they expect this to be over by December 12th .
We believe it can be over by December 12th , and if they come out with an order that says we are not going to count any ballots , that 's going to resolve by December 12th .
If they come out with an order that says we are going to count the ballots , we 're going to start now , we believe that can be resolved by December 12th .

An international team is developing a vaccine against Alzheimer 's Disease and they are trying it out on a new and improved mouse model of the onus .
Correspondent Jessica Berman explains .
Scientists working on a vaccine against Alzheimer 's give a progress report this week in the journal Nature .
The vaccine has only been tested in mice that have been bred to have a form of Alzheimer 's Disease very similar to that of humans .
According to University of Toronto researcher David Westaway , another team of scientists last year took the first step toward an Alzheimer 's vaccine .
That team injected a small amount of amyloid protein , which accumulates in brains of Alzheimer 's patients and injected it in the mice 's abdomens .
The injection prompted the animals ' immune systems to kick in and clean up the amyloid deposits in the rodents ' brains .
But those mice never had any difficulties with learning and memory .
In Dr. Westaway 's view , this made the vaccine sort of pointless , since learning and memory problems are a hallmark of Alzheimer 's Disease .
So his research team decided to test a vaccine in mice with Alzheimer 's more like that seen in many humans .
Now normally Alzheimer 's Disease might have this strong deficit in learning and memory , actually in our experiments the ability to navigate around a small tank of water using cues pinned up on the wall of the testing room , and once we started immunizing the mice against the Alzheimer Disease peptides then the performance showed a dramatic improvement such as they came very close to the performance of regular mice that have not been genetically engineered to resemble Alzheimer 's Disease .
A second Alzheimer 's vaccine experiment was also reported in the journal Nature by a group of University of South Florida scientists in Tampa .
In a third published paper researchers formally described how they genetically engineered a mouse model of Alzheimer 's similar to the human disease , complete with memory and learning impairment .
Neuroscientist Paul Chapman of the Cardiff School of Bio-Sciences in Wales , wrote an article in the magazine commenting on the developments .
We all know we 've got a long way to go before we have a cure for Alzheimer 's Disease , but in order to get there we need to have confidence that we understand the disease and that we have what we call a model system for predicting whether these treatments will work .
And the fact that these papers are now showing us that behaviorally these models do what humans do , that is they behave more poorly as they age if they have Alzheimer 's genes , and that these treatments can reverse that , it just means we have that much more confidence these treatments will work in humans .
In a related development an international team of researchers reports in the latest issue of the journal Science , that a genetic mutation in an area of chromosome ten may put some people at increased risk of late onset Alzheimer 's Disease , the most common form of dementia in the elderly .

A beloved American holiday story comes to the big screen in a Universal Pictures comic fantasy starring Jim Carey .
Alan Silverman has a look at the first feature film adaptation of Dr. Seuss 's " How the Grinch Stole Christmas . "
The late Theodore Geisel , writing under his pen name Dr. Seuss , first published " How the Grinch Stole Christmas " in 1957 .
An instant classic , it 's the whimsical story of the Grinch , a mean - spirited hairy green creature who menaces the holiday loving Hus , who live in Whoville , until an innocent child Mary Lu Hu teaches him to find the joy in life .
Famed animator Chuck Jones made it into a television special , and Dr. Seuss died in 1991 believing that Grinch could never be made into a movie , but with the blessing of the author 's widow , director Ron Howard set out to film the fantasy , not as a cartoon , but with actors in costumes and settings in the spirit of the book .
Of course the book is a very thin , modern fable and it 's great because it 's got this incredible character in it , and themes are very relatable and very , very contemporary and it 's presented in a funny way .
So we knew we had to make a movie that was inspired by the book , and as we developed it , always knowing that we wanted it to be funny , we wanted it to still maintain the kind of that Seussian flavor and we wanted Jim Carey to have a great opportunity to do his thing within the spirit of that great character , the Grinch .
I have always been fascinated with this story , " The Grinch . "
Starter Jim Carey says the Grinch is more than just a cold - hearted character .
He is the outcast .
He is the person who did n't feel like he was part of the club , and so he gave up and that 's what a lot of people do .
They kind of go off and on to hell with the world and all that , and he is basically a guy who just wants to be part of it , you know ?
He just wants to be part of that show , you know , at the heart of it .
His heart changes for that reason , because it 's ready to change .
That 's what I like about it .
All you need is some kind of love , some kind of person who reaches out to you , and goes like , " I know you want to change , I know you do n't want to be that , " you know , so here is your opportunity , you know , and that 's what Cindy Lou does .
Carey performs covered head to toe in that green - haired costume .
He sneaks behind exquisitely detailed makeup by Oscar winner Rick Backer , and even his eyes covered with bright yellow contact lenses , he hardly looks like the star of ' Dumb and Dumber , ' or ' The Truman Show . '
Oh , you will recognize me , and hopefully , you know , from everything everybody is telling me , I got to a point where even through the contacts you saw the Grinch 's soul .
That 's what you are after , as you know , and it 's really just what you project , you know .
If they say " action " and I am still thinking about the suit , I am in trouble , you know , and that is the one thing I am able to do .
I can act , when you say " action " .
And the Grinch with his Grinch feet , ice cold in the snow , stood puzzling and puzzling , and he puzzled , and puzzled , till his puzzler was sore .
Then the Grinch thought of something he had n't before .
, he thought , , maybe Christmas perhaps means a little bit more .
Anthony Hopkins narrates the Dr. Seuss 's verse .
The on - screen cast of " How the Grinch Stole Christmas , " also includes Christine Beranski and Jeffery Tambor , and introduces young Taylor Mumson as Mary Lou Hu .

The United States says it may invite Israeli and Palestinian negotiators to Washington as part of efforts to resume Mid East peace negotiations .
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Washington is exploring the possibility of hosting direct talks between negotiators to build a bridge back to the peace process .
A senior US official added that if the two sides agree , the talks could take place in the middle of next week .
The US commitment follows a surprise meeting between Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben - Ami and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat .
Israeli negotiator Gilead Share left the meeting saying an agreement is still possible .
It is still our assessment that such an agreement is possible within the framework of what we call in a generic name , Camp David .
Under this notion we do assess that Arafat and the Palestinian leadership understand and realize now , that this is a fair , just and reasonable set of ideas that could well be considered as a framework for a permanent status .
The bid for talks was followed by more violence .
Israeli forces killed at least six Palestinians during a number of clashes Friday .

In the Middle East Palestinian and Israeli delegations travel to Washington today for separate talks with US officials on reviving the stalled peace process .
As Ross Dunn reports , word of this week 's talks came from Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat .
Mr. Arafat says separate Israeli and Palestinian negotiators will head for Washington in the next few days to hold talks with US officials on ways to revive the Middle East peace process .
Israeli and Palestinian officials have maintained contacts since the start of violence in late september but formal negotiations had been suspended .
Mr. Arafat also says he 's willing to meet face to face with Prime Minister Barak if it would help the cause of peace , but such a meeting , he adds , should be well prepared .

Egypt has recalled its ambassador to Israel protesting what it calls Israel 's escalation of aggression against the Palestinians .
Egypt 's Middle East news agency carried a foreign ministry statement that said President Hosni Mubarak decided to recall the ambassador after Israeli helicopter gunships attacked Palestinian targets in the Gaza Strip on Monday .
The statement did not say whether the recall was temporary .
President Mubarak is a strong supporter of moderation of the Arab - Israeli conflict .
He has said that a dialogue is the only way to break the current wave of bloody clashes between Israeli forces and the Palestinians .
Israeli troops shot and killed at least three more Palestinians in overnight clashes in Gaza .
Meanwhile , the head of the Palestinian Observer Mission to the United Nations , Nasser al - Kidwa says any protection force sent to the West Bank and Gaza must be under United Nations control .
VOA correspondent Breck Ardery , has more from the UN .
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with UN Secretary General Kofi Annan , Mr. al - Kidwa disputed reports that the Palestinians would accept an observer force that was not under UN control .
We stressed the absolute need for the protection to be achieved through a UN observer force composed of unarmed military observers to be deployed throughout the territories occupied by Israel since 1967 .
Mr. al - Kidwa said only an observer force under UN jurisdiction would have legitimate international authority .
There had previously been reports the Palestinians might accept an observer force from several nations , but not under UN control .
The Palestinians are urging the UN Security Council to adopt a proposed resolution that would send 2000 unarmed observers to Gaza and the West Bank .
Backers of the resolution say the observers would provide a measure of protection for Palestinian civilians .
The United States has said it will not support such a resolution unless both the Palestinians and the Israelis agree to it .
So far , Israel has rejected the idea .
UN Secretary General Annan is talking with both sides .
Israeli UN Ambassador Yehuda Lancry had no substantial public comment after he met with the Secretary General , except to say the meeting was useful .

The incredibly close Florida vote count for President is in the state courts and heading for the US Supreme Court at the end of the week .
That 's virtually unprecedented , as the federal courts have tended to stay out of elections , which are the responsibility of the states .
Joe O'Grossman is a professor of constitutional law at Baltimore 's Johns Hopkins University .
He says that in this instance the Supreme Court probably felt the circumstances were such that they had no real alternative but to take the case .
Well , I think they took the case because it seemed like it was such a important issue that it would be kind of unseemly for them to try to reject it out of hand .
In fact , I think that Lawrence Tribe , the Harvard Law School professor who is arguing for Gore tomorrow , is going to ask the court to hold the case , moot and dismiss it .
And the Bush campaign has brought the case , but recognizes that the particular issues that they brought to the court last week are really not very relevant anymore .
, well , I know what they are going to do .
They are going to try to broaden the case to make it a kind of a general referendum on election procedures .
So , they are looking for a coronation , and the Gore people at this point just want to get rid of this case , because they think they have a better chance in the Florida courts .
Republicans generally support states ' rights .
So , does it appear somewhat ironic that they are going to the Supreme Court in this instance ?
No , I think first of all the notion that Republicans favor states ' rights and Democrats oppose it , is much too simplistic .
That 's generally true , but it 's only true on some issues , and in this case , you could argue that the Bush people are going to the Supreme Court to preserve the right of Florida , to determine its own electors .
So , there is a kind of states ' rights issue there , but they need , or at least they once thought they needed the Supreme Court to endorse it .
So it goes both ways .
What are the justices likely looking for ?
Well , I do n't know .
and I think they will be divided , I mean I do n't think they will be unanimous .
Obviously , they would like to be able to achieve some kind of resolution of the case .
American election laws are often challenged at the local level and sometimes in the federal courts , but this is certainly the first time we have had a Supreme Court challenge over presidential election .
So , there is a lot of new law here to be made or at least law that has n't been made yet .
It 's possible that if the court accepts the invitation of the Bush campaign , at least as it is expressed in the briefs they submitted yesterday , that the court will in the sense , take the entire issue , even - not just the specific questions that it was asked last week and try to resolve the question .
For example , if the court says it is clearly the fact that the legislature of the state of Florida can determine for itself who its electors will be , that will pretty much end the case , because that 's what the legislature already plans to do , and that does n't mean the Gore people wo n't keep trying , because ultimately Congress has to decide and only Congress can decide if there are competing slates of electors submitted , which slate to accept .
The Johns Hopkins University constitutional law professor Joe O'Grossman says , it 's still not certain the Supreme Court will actually hear the Florida case .
As their first order , of business Friday , attorneys for Vice President Gore will move to have the court dismiss the case brought by Republican George W Bush .
Israel 's parliament has given preliminary approval to legislation allowing former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to run in an upcoming special election .

Ebola virus is one of the most feared in the world .
The deadly disease periodically attacks African villages and kills up to 90 % of those infected .
Now , a team of researchers led by scientists at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda , Maryland has developed a vaccine that prevents Ebola virus infections in monkeys .
Dr. Garry Nabal of NIH says , the experiment with the new vaccine involved giving four monkeys the Ebola virus , then injecting them with a placebo immunization , which has no effect .
Four other monkeys were infected with the Ebola virus DNA and then were injected with a vaccine called Ebola - Adnia virus booster .
In the animals that received the control vaccine , i.e. the same vectors , but not expressing the virus proteins , all of the animals had died within six days after challenge .
In contrast , the animals who received the DNA plus the Adnia viral vector that made the viral proteins , not only survived the challenge , but they continued to be symptom - free for over six months , the time point that they were followed .
Scientists must do far more research on this vaccine before a version of it might be used to prevent the disease in humans .
Russian President Vladimir Putin is in Canada for a two - day official visit to discuss economic and security issues with Prime Minister Jean Chretian and other officials .

Leaders of the European Union and five Balkan states meet in Zagreb today to hail a new era of cooperation in a region that has been torn by conflict .
Douglas Paction has more on the story .
The summit , which is being sponsored by the European Union , is meant to show the Balkan states that the EU is preparing to welcome them into the European family .
Christina Gayat , a spokeswoman for EU Foreign Policy Chief Javier Solana , says the summit has an important symbolic value .
I think it will be the occasion to welcome at the highest level of the European Union under the highest level of the region , the very dramatic changes that have occurred since the beginning of the year and to further consolidate democracy and reconciliation .
Analysts say , last month 's formal ouster of Slobodan Milosevic in presidential elections in Yugoslavia was a pivotal event for the region .
The leaders of the five Balkan states of the summit , Yugoslavia , Croatia , Macedonia , Albania and Bosnia are expected to adopt a declaration calling for a political dialogue and regional economic cooperation .
The European Union is offering a 3.9 billion - dollar financial aid program to help the region , which has long been devastated by civil conflict , economic collapse and political isolation .
In return the Balkan leaders will be called upon to continue moving toward democracy and a market economy .
The leaders will also be asked to take steps to fight organized crime , drug trafficking , and money laundering .
Also at the Zagreb summit , Macedonia is expected to sign an association and stabilization pact with the European Union .
This is a first step on the long road to full EU membership .

British Prime Minister Tony Blair arrives in Russia today for talks with Vladimir Putin on security , foreign policy , and economic issues .
They are also expected to discuss a new Russian proposal for deep cuts in US and Russian long - range missiles .
VOA 's Larry James in Moscow .
The highlight of the one - day visit will be three hours of talks on Tuesday , during which Mr. Blair and Mr. Putin will focus on a wide range of issues including Russia 's latest call for cutting the number of strategic nuclear warheads to below 1500 .
President Clinton has said such a deal is possible , but that it will be first necessary to convince Moscow of the merits of America 's proposed missile defense system .
The US wants to amend the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty so it can develop such a system .
Russia believes such a move could spark a new arms race and has threatened to tear up existing weapons agreements and stop disarmament talks if the United States goes ahead .
On Sunday Mr. Putin called on the Russian parliament to quickly ratify the amended Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty .
That treaty requires Russia to make further non-nuclear weapons reductions in some areas of the country including breakaway Chechnya .
President Putin acknowledged that Russia is still violating its commitment in Chechnya , but he said it is only a temporary situation which has the ultimate aim of cutting armaments in the region .
He also thanked the 29 other signatories to the treaty for their understanding .
He said Russia is fully behind the agreement that , he said , is an efficient instrument of ensuring security in Europe for years to come .
The original treaty was signed in 1990 and led to the destruction of thousands of heavy weapons by Nato and the former Warsaw Pact .
Tony Blair became the first Western leader to come to Russia to meet the new President last March even before Mr. Putin was elected .
The Russian leader returned the favor by making London one of his first foreign destinations after taking office .

Trade is also expected to figure significantly in the talks .
Britain ranks as the third largest investor after the United States and Germany with just slightly more than $ 1 billion invested in Russia .

The United Nations climate change conference in the Hague has ended in an impasse after two weeks of intense negotiations .
Delegates from 180 countries were unable to agree on how to cut greenhouse gas emissions , which many believe causes global warming .
Lisa Schline has been monitoring developments from the United Nations headquarters in Geneva .
The delegates were close to an agreement , but in the end a feud between the European Union and the United States caused its unravel .
They disagreed over how targeted cuts in greenhouse gas emissions could be achieved .
Under the Kyoto Protocol , 38 developed countries have to reduce emissions by more than 5 % over the next 10 years .
The United States , which is the world 's biggest polluter , wants to reach its target in large part by counting so - called carbon sinks against its emissions quota .
The United States argued that it has many rich forests and will plant new trees to help absorb carbon from the atmosphere as a means of cutting its emissions .
The EU rejected this proposal as self - serving .
Environmentalists have reacted to the failure with dismay .
Lisa Schline for VOA News , Geneva .
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators are headed home with some ideas put forward by President Clinton after failing to reach a breakthrough in their talks with US officials in Washington .
The negotiators are expected to report back by Wednesday after discussing the ideas with top officials .
After a meeting at the White House Saturday , none of those involved in the talks would give details about Mr. Clinton 's ideas on how to break this stalemate and proceed toward a peace settlement .
After the meeting Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben - Ami would only say that formidable obstacles remain .
It 's still too early to confirm , that is we need to deliberate between ourselves on whether we see these ideas that were raised here , as a basis for an end game .
Chief Palestinian negotiator Sayeeb Erekat told reporters that serious differences continue concerning Jerusalem , refugee , security and territorial issues .
Major gaps still exist .
This morning we 've heard ideas from President Clinton .
We will convey to President Arafat and then we 'll take it from there as to what will be the next step .
Mr. Clinton is working hard for a peace deal before he leaves office next month .
There are reports that he could meet separately with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat , then decide if there was reason for a three way summit , but the White House is calling talks of such a summit premature .
And the UN High Commissioner for Refugees says southwestern Guinea is on the verge of a major humanitarian disaster because of regional fighting .

Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is proposing to transfer to the Palestinians another 10 % of the West Bank and to recognize a Palestinian state under a possible future extended interim accord .
Palestinian officials are rejecting the offer saying it does not meet their main concerns over Jerusalem and refugees .
Correspondent Eve Connan in Jerusalem reports the violence in the Middle East continues as Mr. Barak and other politicians begin preparing for early elections .
Prime Minister Barak , offering an unusually detailed description of his peace plan , said Thursday he would recognize an independent Palestinian state , but would postpone negotiating the issue of control over Jerusalem .
Mr. Barak is hoping to hammer out a peace deal with the Palestinians before facing early elections two years into what should have been his four - year term .
He suggested that if no accord was reached on Jerusalem , Palestinians should be granted 10 % of the West Bank under an interim agreement , but the Palestinians are seeking a permanent peace deal that would grant them independence and East Jerusalem as their capital .
Mr. Barak told a news conference he is not trying to speed up peace negotiations in order to win re-election , but that he will not delay efforts to end the violence .
Eve Connan , VOA News , Jerusalem .
President Vladimir Putin began an official visit to Cuba Wednesday , the first by a Russian leader since the collapse of the Soviet Union almost a decade ago .
VOA 's Sonia Paes reports that unlike Soviet leaders , Mr. Putin intends to concentrate on business , not politics .
In the old days of the Cold War when Soviet leaders met with Cuba 's Fidel Castro , it was usually a time for bear hugs and long and often fiery ideological speeches .
Times have changed .
Russian President Vladimir Putin has made it clear he brings no ideological baggage with him to Cuba this week .
According to political analyst Andre Reabov of the Carnegie Endowment in Moscow , strengthening Russia 's business and economic ties with Cuba are a priority for Mr. Putin .
Seems to me that one of the goals of this visit is to help , maybe to advance the interest of Russian companies in this island and maybe to restore the economical relationship between the Russian Federation and Cuba .
During Soviet times , Moscow poured in cash to subsidize the Cuban economy .
The Soviet Union provided Cuba with oil , petroleum products , foodstuffs and heavy machinery .
In return Moscow took Cuban sugar , citrus fruits , nickel and cobalt .
Today bilateral trade is a fraction of what it once was and stands at under one billion dollars a year .
President Putin has said it was a mistake to let that relationship wither and to allow foreign competitors to take the place that Russian enterprises once held .
The debt issue is certain to come up during talks in Havana .
Moscow would like to see Cuba repay some of the billions of dollars it still owes from loans that date back to the Soviet era .
No breakthrough agreements are expected but discussions are likely to also focus on finishing or reactivating a number of projects begun during Soviet times .
The Russian leader meets with President Castro Thursday morning and is also to hold talks with National Assembly President Ricardo Alarkon .
The issue of Cuban - American affairs is another likely topic of discussion .
On Tuesday President Putin called for an end to the American trade embargo against Cuba .
Political analyst Riyardov thinks Mr. Putin would like to encourage some sort of a between Havana and Washington , much as he has tried to do earlier this year with the United States and North Korea .
Mr. Putin tried to play the role of mediator between the Kinshumir regime of the Northern Korea and the US administration .
Seems to me he would delight to try to use the same line in the relationship between the Castro 's regime and the US administration too .
Such an attempt would be in line with Mr. Putin 's overall foreign policy agenda .
He wants to enhance Russia 's standing in the world and to do that he believes that Moscow must assume a greater role in international affairs .
After talks in Havana on Thursday , Mr. Putin and his wife are scheduled to head to one of Cuba 's premier beach resorts for two days of rest before traveling on to Canada .

The United Nations in East Timor has issued the first indictments of suspects in the atrocities committed during the territory 's 1999 vote to separate from Indonesia .
Patricia Nunan reports from Jakarta .
A UN spokesman says eleven suspects , including an Indonesian military officer , have been indicted for murder and the forced of civilians in East Timor last year .
Ten members of an anti-independence militia group and the officer from Indonesia 's Special Forces , are accused of killing 13 people , that includes the murder of five clergymen , two church workers and an Indonesian journalist in the district of in September 1999 .
Of the eleven accused , nine of the suspects are being held by the United Nations in East Timor .
The Indonesian military officer and one other remain at large .
Elements of the Indonesian military are believed to have organized and supported anti-independence militias and have seized control of East Timor after separated from Indonesia in a UN sponsored ballot .
Three weeks of bloodshed followed , in which hundreds died while hundreds of thousands fled their homes or were forced to leave by Indonesian soldiers .
The chaos called for the deployment of international peacekeepers in East Timor , to restore order before full independence expected next year .
Since then United Nations and the Indonesian government have been working together to investigate alleged war crimes committed by troops and militia groups .
UN efforts to bring all suspects to justice have been met .
Just last week the investigation hit a stumbling block , when five Indonesian policemen refused to appear for questioning as witnesses at the Attorney General 's office .
Their lawyers argued that they are not legally bound to cooperate with the UN probe .
UN officials hope the Jakarta side of the investigation will resume early in the new year .

Thank you very much Bob .
There could be verdicts today in three different court cases relating to the State 's contested presidential election in Florida and the verdicts are believed to comprise Vice President Al Gore 's last chance to win the White House by reversing George W Bush 's election day victory .
Corespondent Nick Semion reports from Tallahassee where the most closely watched ruling could come from Florida 's Supreme Court .
Florida 's highest court must decide whether to overturn a strongly ordered lower court decision that firmly rejected Vice President Gore 's request for a hand recount of thousands of .
The Bush campaign says this would amount to rewriting Florida election law and that no evidence exists that any voter was denied the right to cast the ballot .
In two separate cases , lower courts are considering a demand by pro-Gore voters that thousands of absentee ballots be thrown out because Republican party workers were allowed to adjust ballot applications .
Bush campaign attorney Matthew Staber says the solution should not be to penalize the wrong people .
When we look at the remedy that they are requesting , even the disenfranchisement of one voice in this case is a price too high to pay .
While all this is going on , the Republican leaders of Florida 's legislature begin a special session Friday , to appoint the state 's 25 electors , a move designed to ensure that George W Bush is guaranteed enough electoral votes to win the White House .
Dick Semion , VOA News , Tallahassee .
And finally tonight , to Russia , with interest and curiosity .
While we may have our own problems here with a roller coaster of an election , they 've got some flip - flopping of their own going on when it comes to their national anthem .
ABC 's Richard Gizbert reports .
In a country that shed most symbols of its authoritarian past almost a decade ago , one of them is coming out of retirement -- the old Soviet anthem .
It was always a bold , stirring melody , a feature of the military parades in Red Square that Westerners came to recognize through medal ceremonies at the Olympic Games , but , like most Soviet symbols , it had to go .
`` we should bury it forever , '' this man says .
`` Our citizens were massacred to the sound of that anthem , and we were deprived of our freedom . ''
So Boris Yeltsin , who throughout his presidency displayed an interest in , if not a sophistication for , music , got rid of it .
He replaced it with a century Russian composition -- 7777 -- an instrumental with no lyrics to offend anyone , and that 's part of the problem .
Russian athletes were uncomfortably mute when their new lyric-less anthem was played .
Some even complained that it hurt team morale .
Ordinary Russians have difficulty humming the tune -- humming dissonantly -- not like the old anthem , 7777 humming melodically and Boris Yeltsin 's successor , President Vladimir Putin was clearly not a fan .
Putin , a Soviet - era KGB agent , wanted to revive the Soviet anthem .
He wants to present this idea of a strong state in symbols , in the flag , in the national anthem , but Putin realized that the anthem 's old pro-Communist lyrics would n't resonate in the new Russia .
So this past week parliament approved Putin 's compromise proposal , bring the melody of the old anthem back and come up with some new words .
Agreeing on those new words will not be easy , in a country that often can not escape or does not want to escape its Soviet past .

And in Yemen , the investigation into the bombing that killed 17 U.S. sailors continues as 33 injured sailors returned home today to Norfolk , Virginia .
Well , big news in the money scope today .
Across the country , they were lining up jostling , even scuffling for the most wanted toy in America , which went on sale at midnight .
The Sony PlayStation plays video games .
It 's the latest in a line of ever improving game machines that began with the Atari , some of us remember , so many years ago .
This , however , is a toy with greater ambitions .
Here 's ABC 's Brian Rooney .
The Sony Corporation hopes those people who waited in line are the people who will lead Sony into domination of all home entertainment .
The game is worth waiting for , because it is the entertainment system of the future .
PlayStation 2 offers what fans believe is the most realistic animation in home video games , car racing that makes you feel `` G '' forces , fighting games with punch , sports games , the runners even congratulate each other after the race .
Today , Sony is offering , and may already have sold , half a million sets of PlayStation 2 in the United States .
PlayStation 2 in the first 60 days will generate $ 1 billion in retail .
That 's not all .
Sony has given PlayStation 2 a digital video disk player and a hookup ready for the day when the cousin installs broadband cable internet service in the house .
Then they can sell by wire Sony games , music and movies .
So this is really kind of their long - term strategy .
They see this as a platform for the digital delivery content to consumers ' homes .
The Babbage 's chain of 1,000 game stores sold out 60,000 PlayStations overnight , and everyone sold for $ 300 is a chance to get as much as $ 200 more from each customer .
There 's lots and lots of opportunities to add new accessories and games .
Selling , that 's the real game here , and Sony will not be the only entry .
Microsoft is developing a system called XIC Box for release next year , and Nintendo , once a dominant player , is plotting a comeback .
The winners get your attention , and your money .

In the Palestinian territories today , violence on violence again .
It began with the bombing of a school bus carrying children of Jewish settlers .
It ended with one of the most punishing Israeli responses in weeks .
Here 's ABC 's Gillian Findlay .
For two hours tonight , Israeli helicopters and ships fired missile after missile on Gaza , with 50 missiles in all , hitting police buildings , Palestinian security buildings , several offices of Yasser Arafat 's political organization .
Unlike previous attacks , this one began without warning and early enough that people were still in the streets .
Gaza hospitals reported dozens of wounded , mostly bruises , doctors said , and shock .
Earlier today , it was Israelis in shock after a bomb exploded next to a bus filled with school children .
One of the Jewish settlements in Gaza .
The bus was armored , a usual precaution here , but the explosion was powerful .
Shrapnel killed two parents and injured several children seriously .
This road , a lifeline for the several hundred Jewish settlers who live here , has been targeted dozens of times in recent weeks .
Today , the Palestinian Authority was quick to deny any responsibility , pointing out the road is patrolled by Israeli soldiers .
The incident took place in an area which is under their control , under their security , jurisdiction , and they have to blame themselves .
But after tonight 's attack , Israel 's Prime Minister said none of this would have happened if Yasser Arafat had not let known terrorists out of jail .
We find no way than to respond like any other free world democracy .
Mr. Barak vowed the use of as much force as necessary to end this kind of violence .
Late tonight , in several Palestinian towns , the cry once more was for revenge .
Jillin Findley , Jerusalem .
Good evening .
It took the angry voices of hundreds of thousands of people protesting for days , but tonight Slobodan Milosevic finally admitted he is no longer the President of Yugoslavia , and he said he had just received that information .
It followed a day of intense behind - the - scenes negotiation to decide his future and the future of the country .
For now , it seems the new regime of President Kostunica is not insisting Milosevic leave the country .
ABC 's Bob Woodruff is in Belgrade tonight .
In a surprise live speech tonight , Slobodan Milosevic conceded his loss and congratulated his opponent .
I , myself , am relieved by the enormous responsibility I have borne for a whole decade .
I plan to rest a bit and spend time with my family , after that , to help my party gain force and contribute to the future of the country .
On the streets on the second day of the revolution , the people of Yugoslavia are savoring their victory , swept up by the sudden death of their dictatorship .
Belgrade has become one big party .
While the people celebrated , Slobodan Milosevic reappeared in Belgrade in a videotaped meeting .
Russia 's Foreign Minister had come to tell him that the Russians no longer are behind him and he should accept defeat .
Sources say Milosevic was defiant , promising to stay in Yugoslavia and in politics .
The people here say , their new President , Vojislav Kostunica , is quickly becoming a populist leader .
Today he , too , met with Russia 's Foreign Minister , who carried the Russian President 's endorsement , and tonight he went on national television to take direct questions from the viewers -- something Milosevic never dared to do .
Disdain for Milosevic seems to be growing .
Yesterday 's uprising was targeted mostly at him .
The crowds focused much of their anger on anything associated with Milosevic .
This is the local party headquarters of Milosevic 's wife .
As you can see , every window is broken and the building is trashed .
The mob also singled out and destroyed the store owned by Milosevic 's son .
They burned the TV station that carried Milosevic 's words and beat the station 's director , but tonight , the people seem to be turning away from anger , praying instead for a better future .
A future and a country without Slobodan Milosevic .

In other news today , the annual Christmas migration is under way from every part of the country , and many other parts of the world .
People are trying to reach their people somewhere else .
New York 's La Guardia Airport has been a nightmare this year , but there is some good news .
Even with the bad weather and the number of people flying , the industry says 2 million in the U.S. alone , things are not as bad as they might be .
Here 's ABC 's Bob Jamieson .
Reporter :
At Chicago 's O'Hare Airport , ground zero for air travel troubles all year -- there was a holiday surprise .
220,000 passengers jammed the airport , but with good weather and labor peace at United Airlines , there were few delays .
We 're actually on time today .
A rare thing that happens here .
Reporter :
There were scattered delays in Philadelphia , New York and Boston .
Snow fell all day long in the Northeast , causing poor visibility , but little stayed on the ground .
Across the country , skies were clear at almost every major airline hub and little change is expected tomorrow , which was particularly welcome at Atlanta 's Hartsfield Airport .
Earlier this week , bad weather added to a labor dispute between Delta Airlines and its pilots caused scores of cancellations and hundreds of delays .
Still , Delta said it was forced to cancel 5 % of its flights today , because some pilots refused overtime .
This journey started at 6:45 a.m. , and it does n't look like there 's any promise of getting out of here tonight .
Reporter :
Analysts say travelers should still consider today an early Christmas present .
Anybody that thinks this will be the way that air travel is through the rest of the holidays and into the year 2001 are in for a real surprise .
This is not at all the way things usually are .
Reporter :
Which may explain why so many , almost 45 million people , are traveling by car this weekend , up sharply from last year .
And few problems are reported .
All aboard .
Reporter :
Amtrak is expected to have more passengers too .
I take the train because it 's a lot more sane than flying .
Reporter :
The rail carrier is adding 16,000 seats in the Northeast alone , many for passengers who decided not to take a chance on the weather or the airlines .
Bob Jamieson , ABC News , New York .
We all know it pays to keep checking .
abcnews.com has up to the minute reporting on travel in the country .
President Clinton has reportedly approved a $ 12 million plan to give aid to Iraqi opposition groups .
According to `` the Washington Post , '' the money would be used to help distribute food -- medicine and other humanitarian relief .
Final think evening -- on this Halloween , witchcraft .
At least 500,000 Americans now describe themselves as witches , in that they practice witchcraft in one part of the country or another .
Many find what witches do inoffensive , but not so in part of Louisiana .
Peggy Wehmeyer reports on what is acceptable in New Orleans is anything but not far away .
When it comes to spirituality , New Orleans is a city of contrasts .
Attend Mass on Sunday morning , visit fortune tellers and voodoo queens by noon .
But practices that go mostly unnoticed in New Orleans are causing a stir because 70 miles down the road in a conservative bayou town , a home to more than 100 churches and a coven of witches .
The main belief in witchcraft is harm none .
Not everyone in town thinks these witches are harmless .
Many fear they are introducing dangerous spirits into the community .
The church is gainst everything we stand for as a Christian nation .
We want to stand up and say not in our community .
We want to say absolutely not .
In an effort to end witchcraft , a resident filed a complaint against the witches using an old law that forbids fortune - telling .
The witches believe that through these rituals and the reeged of Tarot cards , their gods and goddesses will direct their futures .
Local officials sent a detective to the coven to photograph the evidence .
All of a sudden , we get a knock on the door .
He says , I 'm going to turn these pictures in to my superiors and they 're going to determine if it is fortune - telling .
If it is , I 'll arrest you .
The ACLU is trying to abolish that threat .
The group is now suing Louisiana on behalf of the witches to abolish the 1928 law it considers unconstitutional .
We do n't protect the wicked free speech right , then the Baptists and Catholics ' free speech right is at risk .
They say they do n't have a case against the witches but they fear the witch - hunt will continue until the fortune - telling law is off the book for good .

Still in Asia , President Clinton signed a bill today granting China permanent normal trade relations .
This will end the annual review of China 's trade status and lower tariffs on Chinese imports .
China , in return , has agreed to open its market wider to goods from the U.S .
The Palestinian territories today , three Jewish settlers were killed by Palestinians .
Two men were on a bus when Palestinians fired on a bus and a woman was killed when her car was fired on .
The Palestinians had warned they would retaliate for Thursday 's assassination of a commander of the Fatah organization .
In Washington this was a day about beginnings , but it 's also one of farewells .
Bill Clinton said good-bye .
Few people can really know what it must be like to leave the White House as President that final time .
We do know that Mr. Clinton worked right up until the end , granting more than 100 pardons as he walked out the door .
Here 's ABC 's John Cochran .
7777
An hour after seeing George W. Bush sworn in , Bill Clinton for the first time in 8 years was no longer introduced as the President of the United States .
It is , indeed , my great honor and privilege to introduce to you now our President of the United States .
Cheers
This was the farewell from his Washington friends .
Many had served in his government .
Many of them are not sure what the future holds for them .
You know how it is when you leave the White House , you wonder if you 'll draw a crowd again .
The President told supporters they should be proud of what his administration had accomplished .
You gave me the ride of my life .
I tried to give as good as I got .
Even though he tried to keep up the spirits , he had gone through an emotional 24 hours himself , refusing to sleep last night , savoring every hour in the White House , working until the end --
Less than two hours before he lost his presidential powers , he granted pardons to 140 Americans , including Henry Cisneros , former Housing Secretary convicted of lying to the FBI , Roger Clinton , the former President 's half - brother , John Deutch , the former CIA director who pleaded guilty yesterday to mishandling classified materials , Patty Hearst , and Susan M Dougal , a friend of the Clintons who served part of her time in the jail for refusing to testify about them .
It hurt my mom and dad so much to hear convicted felon .
Now no one can say that again .
By late this afternoon , as movers transported the belongings to the home in Chappaqua , he had no longer the power to grant pardons , and at a rally in New York , it was the state 's new senator who got the spotlight .
Thank you all so much .
To those who think Bill Clinton has seen his last hurrah , he has this to say -- `` I may no longer be President , but I 'll be around . ''
Mr. Bush has yet to take office .
How will it be once he takes over ?
One writer asked today , Will black Americans be eternal victims ? Will Mr. Bush and millions of blacks be permanently estranged ?
Here is ABC 's John Martin .
As usual , it took a comedian to say what many Americans are thinking .
Give Bush credit .
You realize Bush has named more black people to his administration than voted for him .
Today , George W. Bush signaled his intention to mend fences with black Americans .
I 've got a lot of work to do , but I welcome the opportunity .
I look forward to the chance .
Georgetown law professor Sheryll Cashin worked in the first Clinton White House .
Will it be important for him to reach out ?
Will it be necessary ?
Yes .
Maybe not necessary , but definitely important .
Important for several reasons .
Republicans hold only a five - vote majority in Congress , so the 38 black votes lined up by this member , Eddie Bernice Johnson , will be crucial .
She is the new chair of the Black Caucus .
The consequences of his ignoring us means his programs will not probably be successful .
Mr. Bush wants to build bridges to the White House and gain support among blacks .
The question is whether that 's feasible without antagonizing his political base .
Black leaders say without Bush 's support on the issues which matter to them , they will mobilize and work extra hard to get the vote out next time in even greater numbers for the Democrats .
John Martin , ABC News , Washington .
In yesterday 's ruling from Florida 's Supreme Court , the chief justice warned recounting undervotes in the counties would cause `` confusion and disorder . ''
In some places today those words appeared prophetic .
Mike Von Fremd from Jacksonville .
When the Supreme Court issued its decision to stop , observers in the counting room were told to leave .
Are you serious ?
As soon as I see it in writing , if it says stop , I will stop .
We 're stopping right now until I see if we need to keep on stopping .
The process stopped before a single ballot was counted .
Tempers flared early on after the Republican chairman of the Canvassing Board announced in advance that it was impossible to meet tomorrow 's p.m. deadline .
No possible way .
If he can not carry out his constitutional duty to do this , then he should do as the judge in Tallahassee did , recuse himself , put somebody there who can get it done !
cheers and applause
The problem is that the 5,000 undercount ballots are mixed in with the pool of nearly 300,000 ballots .
They flew in a computer consultant to install a program to separate the ballots .
His explanation of how it all works baffled me .
We load the cards into the reader hopper at which time the machine looks for a light and then passes into the stacker .
From beginning to end , both sides fought every step of the way .
This morning they could not decide how to begin .
Tonight , the two sides are arguing about what to do now that they have been told to stop .
Democrats say , at least sort the ballots .
Republicans said , No way .

As for the animals , when it comes to genetically engineered animals , the law 's having an even tougher time keeping pace with science .
A U.S. company is seeking government permission to bring genetically altered fish to America 's kitchens .
Kevin Newman reports from a Canadian province .
For as long as they 've told stories , fishermen on this Canadian island province have shared tales of their catch .
Lobster in recent years , but not too long ago , another delicacy -- salmon .
Oh , yeah , we used to get salmon in the spring , but we do n't see it anymore .
I think they are pretty well wiped out .
But only two miles away , Atlantic salmon are thriving , and that 's an understatement .
These experimental salmon are on the cutting edge of the debate over genetically engineered food because a company has found a way to make the bigger one use growth hormone more efficiently .
It reaches full size faster .
How old is this fish ?
You 're looking at 2 1 / 2 years .
How old is this fish ?
Same age .
It is up to the Food and Drug Administration to decide if these will be the first genetically engineered beings to make it to your dinner table .
But is that agency also capable of judging what impact it may have on other species ?
Senior government wildlife experts have their doubts .
I think it 's asking more of the FDA than it should be asked to turn it into a wildlife agency .
The FDA says it has hired experts in the field , but unlike wildlife agencies , the FDA keeps its research and evaluations secret from the public .
Laws do stipulate that there are certain types of material that we need to hold in confidence .
Which worries some who think it 's important people know if creating supersalmon to feed human appetites could threaten normal salmon .
We have shown they have a tremendous potential to upset the balance of nature .
The company producing the supersalmon says it can solve that problem by engineering fish that never mate , but the balance of nature grows more complicated and controversial , the deeper man explores the power of creation .
Kevin Newman , ABC News , Souris , Prince Edward Island .
American Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross goes to Morocco this week for meetings with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat .
News of the meeting came the same day Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak resigned .
Barak 's dramatic move is considered a tactical one .
After a special election in two months , he hopes to be back in office .
There were a couple of indications earlier about how important Social Security has become as an issue in the presidential campaign .
Everyone agrees it needs fixing and if it is n't reformed , it will eventually run out of money .
George W. Bush wants to modernize Social Security , as he puts it , by allowing workers to take a small share of their Social Security , payroll tax , to increase themselves .
Al Gore wants to maintain the existing system .
He says he would save Social Security by reducing the national debt and giving Social Security extra money .
ABC 's John Martin takes a closer look from the battleground state of Missouri .
At a small robotics company in a St. Louis suburb , the Blumers , father and son , work side by side .
George Bush 's plan to allow them to invest a small portion of their Social Security payroll taxes in the stock market is where they part ways .
I could do with it what I want .
If I made a bad decision , then falls back on me , and I do n't have to complain about anybody else messin' my money .
It 's retirement money .
It 's Social Security money .
If you lose it , it 's gone .
The issue comes down to this -- will voters believe Al Gore 's promise to protect Social Security the way it is ? or will they take a gamble and trust George Bush 's plan to privatize part of it ?
Some Missouri voters are not sure Social Security will be there for them , so they are ready to take a risk .
Mike Dubis is 29 , father of three .
Giving all that money to Uncle Sam to earn his 2 % on it or me turning around making 27 % or 30 % on it , I 'd have to go that way .
That way was a simple appeal .
I just want more of a say - so of what I can do with my own money .
At a union hall , retirees worry that Bush is gambling with their Social Security benefits .
I do n't think nobody has the option to take my Social Security and invest it in nothing .
It 's mine !
Gore targets independents like Hank and Loretta Goehring to drive home the point that the Bush plan will take $ 1 trillion out of the system .
They got a phone message by actor Ed Asner .
Hi , this is Ed Asner .
But I do n't think we have enough money to cover both promises .
Neither candidate says how he will guarantee Social Security 's future , and both resist saying it will cost more money .
Do you never see the need in the future to raise taxes or cut benefits ?
I certainly hope not .
An ABC News poll shows voters divided on who will best protect Social Security , but 58 % support a plan like Bush 's .
In this era of stock market wealth , they see his idea as an opportunity , not the end of Social Security .
John Martin , ABC News , St. Louis .
There are a lot of complexities in Social Security in both of these plans .
If you go to our website , abc.com , that may help .
It will be a long time that it 's forgotten that Mr. Bush won this the way he did in the Supreme Court .
Yes , it took a while last night to sort out precisely what the court had decided by such a narrow margin .
It is case number 00949 , and it will be dissected for years to come .
Here 's ABC 's Jackie Judd .
The Supreme Court cleared the way for George W. Bush to become President by interpreting the principle of `` equal protection under the law '' in a way it had never done before .
Equal protection cases often deal with discrimination based on race .
Here , the court applied it to counting voters ' ballots .
It 's now become clear , that as a matter of federal law , there have to be reasonably uniform standards for collecting people 's votes and for interpreting those votes .
In fact , equal protection became the single issue this divided court could find a majority to support .
This was a stabilizing decision that restored order to a very chaotic situation .
And with that in mind , the justices -- in a highly unusual move -- said their ruling `` is limited to the present circumstances '' only , meaning it applies just to Bush v. Gore .
Not likely , say many legal experts .
What they 've done now amounts to , what could be a very important general principle , and take it right back again immediately by saying , `` well , we do n't intend to enforce this in any other case . ''
Even those who support aspects of the ruling still expect it to affect many states with election laws similar to Florida .
That raises a host of new questions , not just about recounts , but about different voting machines and differences between one city and another city within the same state .
Even it raises questions about differences between citizens of different states .
This historic decision will certainly be remembered as the one that put a President in the White House , but it may also become a decision that expands the judiciary 's role in future elections as well .
Jackie Judd , ABC News , the Supreme Court .
Like many Heartland states , Iowa has had trouble keeping young people down on the farm or anywhere within state lines .
With population waning , the state is looking beyond its borders for newcomers .
As ABC 's Jim Sciutto reports , one little town may provide a big lesson .
On homecoming night Postville feels like Hometown , USA , but a look around this town of 2,000 shows it 's become a miniature Ellis Island .
This was an all - white , all - christian community that all the sudden was taken over -- not taken over , that 's a very bad choice of words , but invaded by , perhaps different groups .
It began when a Hasidic Jewish family bought one of the town 's two meat - packing plants 13 years ago .
First they brought in other Hasidic Jews , then Mexicans , Palestinians , Ukrainians .
The plant and another next door changed the face of Postville .
I think Postville might be catching up with the rest of America .
If you look all over America , if you did a study of any great city , you would see the same thing .
The plants helped spur economic development in a town that had long been stagnant .
Stores are expanding .
New apartments and houses are being built , and there are hundreds of new jobs , making unemployment almost nonexistent .
What else would you like ?
Postville now has 22 different nationalities , but some residents have n't welcomed the newcomers .
They have no insurance on their cars .
They do n't stop at stop signs .
They do not put their children in a cash -- they 've never heard of a car seat .
You know we 've been here a long time and I think most people would meet them halfway , but that does n't seem to be what they want .
For those who prefer the old Postville , Mayor John Hyman has a simple answer .
I just tell them , you 've got to change .
They 're here to stay .
They 're not gon na leave , and you 're going to have to adapt to these people .
Iowa 's governor is now looking to follow Postville 's example , relaxing immigration quotas .
It 's a goal that seems possible when on homecoming night the starting kicker is 14 - year - old Nikita Kargalskiy , who may be 5,000 miles from his hometown in Russia .

In the Palestinian territories today , four Palestinians were killed by Israeli soldiers and a motorist was shot by a sniper .
The Clinton administration is concerned about a situation spinning out of control .
The U.S. said that yesterday 's Palestinian attack to a school bus was an atrocious act and the U.S. told the Israelis that their use of excessive force is not the right way to go .
Egypt has recalled its ambassador from Israel to protest the rocket attacks on Gaza .
When the `` USS Cole '' was attacked last October and 17 sailors were killed , one of the sailors on board the `` USS Cole '' used his own camera to record some of the aftermath .
These are pictures you have not seen before , what the terrorists did to a $ 1 billion ship , not to mention the country 's morale .
Here 's ABC 's John M Wethy .
Most of the sailors who died were about to have lunch .
A half - eaten meal still sits on the table .
A few feet away , destruction is total -- the floor driven up through the ceiling , a deadly twisting of steel , daylight showing through a gaping hole in the side of the ship .
We was lucky to make it through all this .
Seaman Carl Wingate , who shot this home video , remembers the moment , along with his shipmates .
It was a really loud boom .
I mean , it 's almost undescribable how loud it was .
I actually started running up the passageway , up the ladder .
I opened up the door , and there was no deck there .
It 's gone .
I felt my whole body shaking .
I thought I was getting electrocuted .
I did n't know what was going on .
In the hours just after the blast , the crew is in a state of shock .
Some still covered with soot from the explosion wander through darkened passageways , still not sure what hit them .
God was with me today .
A senior enlisted man says he would have been killed if he had not been called to a meeting moments before the blast .
There was debris laying all over .
Outside , the ship 's exterior walls are pitted by shrapnel from the explosion .
An orange life raft , blown from the deck , is plastered to the side of the bridge , like a moth on the front of a speeding car .
Crewmen , now at battle stations , stand at a 50 - caliber machine gun that was unmanned when the attack occurred .
The Navy 's final report on the `` Cole '' attack is expected to explain why no one will be punished , even though the captain and crew failed to take basic steps to protect the ship .
Sources say the Navy itself will accept part of the blame , by admitting all its ships were vulnerable and its sailors were not trained to expect this kind of attack .
John M Wethy , ABC News , the Pentagon .
Some of the other news today --
In Washington , Israeli and Palestinian negotiators met again with President Clinton and were slightly optimistic .
The Palestinian negotiator said there was some progress on Palestinian sovereignty over part of Jerusalem .
The attack on the `` USS Cole '' in Yemen is being reassessed tonight .
ABC 's Barry Serafin is in our Washington Bureau .
I gather the thing that the Navy is looking at is the actual timing .
We were led to believe that the attack occurred just as the `` USS Cole '' was tying up .
Not true , apparently ?
Not true , according to new information now released by the Navy , Peter .
The Navy now says the ship was actually moored nearly two hours before the explosion took place .
It was , in fact , in the process of being refueled at the time of the blast .
the theory was that RTJ C World News / Peter Jennings ABC % RTJ ! had slipped in as part of the mooring operation .
That was not true .
The ship was tied up .
It was in a very vulnerable position as it was being refueled .
However , the Navy now says that hands on deck who were manning machine guns , as part of an alert , still believed they had seen this small boat as part of the mooring operation , and that is apparently why they were not suspicious .
Let me understand the last point again .
If it was not part of the mooring operation , does it mean it was lost in a cluster of boats or operating clear to sea ?
This was a small boat that at that point , Peter , should not have been approaching this ship , but apparently the hands on deck who were supposed to be maintaining security , believed this was a small boat they had seen earlier as part of the mooring operation , and therefore did not view it as a suspicious boat .
Thanks very much .
It often happens in a case like this , as time goes on , the assessment changes .
Today , the bodies of the last four sailors recovered from the `` Cole '' were sent home to the United States .
17 sailors were killed in the blast .
At Arlington National Cemetery , the first of the funerals .
Cheron Gunn from Rex , Georgia was buried next to his ship mate Richard Costello of Morrisville , Pennsylvania .
Overseas this evening , Arafat has made a public appeal to Palestinians to stop shooting at Israeli targets in the Palestinian territories .
The Israeli Prime Minister said that was not adequate .
Four Palestinians were killed by Israeli soldiers in the territories today .
The chief prosecutor at the International War Crimes Tribunal has demanded the new Yugoslav President hand Slobodan Milosevic over to face trial for war crimes , but the U.S. , which has spent enormous amounts of time and energy fighting Milosevic , seems more willing to wait tonight .
Here 's our national security correspondent , John M Wethy .
Tonight the U.S. is still offering to pay $ 5 million for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Slobodan Milosevic for war crimes .
I believe we can not ignore the actions of the war crimes tribunal .
I think we have to continue to support it , but there no longer seems to be any urgency about grabbing Milosevic .
The important thing first is to get him out of any position of any kind of power .
Senior administration officials are now saying privately that if Milosevic never comes to trial , the U.S. might not like it , but could live with it , as long as the man is gone .
The new President of Yugoslavia , Vojislav Kostunica , has made it clear he would not be likely to turn over Milosevic or anyone else to the war crimes tribunal .
He says the tribunal is not fair and is manipulated by the U.S. -- the same criticism Milosevic had , but in most ways , Milosevic and Vojislav Kostunica have starkly different views .
On freedom of the press , rule of law and a free market economy , Milosevic opposed them all .
Kostunica supports them .
His great advantage above all else is the fact that he is not corrupt .
He 's clean .
He seems as the most honorable man in Serbian politics .
Like most Serbs , Kostunica is bitterly critical of Nato 's bombing campaign last year .
He also thinks the Clinton administration and especially Madeleine Albright pursued anti-Serbian policies .
At the same time , in many respects , he is very pro-American .
To help him , the U.S. is moving quickly to lift economic sanctions and is exploring ways to send aid .
The U.S. now has 10,000 troops in the Balkans , at a cost of $ 4 billion a year .
The next step will be to look for ways to cut those numbers .

This week , Israel began opening its borders , just slightly , so that some Palestinians could go back to work .
Officials say the block over the past two months has been necessary for security , but for Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank , it has been an economic nightmare .
Here 's ABC 's Gillian Findlay .
This is how bad it has gotten for Ahmad Al - dour .
Out of work , out of savings , he is now trying to sell one of the few valuables he has left .
The most important thing is to buy milk for the children , says this father of two .
I do n't care about the price .
I just need to sell it .
These days , Gaza 's central market is filled with people who need to sell .
TV's , stereos , even bicycles .
Mohammed 's parents told him they needed the money for food .
Israel says it closed its borders for security reasons , but the economic impact here has been devastating .
It 's not just that tens of thousands of Palestinians who used to work in Israel are unemployed , construction in Gaza has all but stopped .
Israel has blocked cement supplies .
Gas is also in short supply , and from time to time , so is food .
According to the United Nations , in just three months , the number of Palestinians living below the poverty line has risen by 50 % .
One in three Palestinians now live on less than $ 2 a day .
Their economy , which had been growing , now loses close to $ 9 million a day .
I really do n't think we have much longer than the end of January before real disaster starts hitting from the economic point of view .
Five years ago Bashar Al - masri gave up a successful Washington investment career to return to Ramallah and help build the new Palestinian state .
Business was good , he says , until the Palestinians started their uprising .
Israel began shooting back .
The bullet came in here and hit the wall right here .
And all of Mr. Al - masri 's investors fled .
Soon , he says , he will have no choice but to lay off his staff , making more people unemployed , more people desperate .
If the Israelis think that things are going to get better , they are going to get much , much worse because you are going to have many more people who are hopeless .
Hopeless , and angry .
Israel says it wants security .
Palestinians say , strangling them economically is only going to make things worse .

In the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador , the oil spill that threatens so many species of rare birds and animals is now the size of Los Angeles .
Cleanup teams are desperately trying to save the hundreds of endangered species .
A tanker ran aground last week off San Cristobal Island , and our Ned Potter is there tonight .
This morning , the tanker was practically on its side , the waves breaking it off just 500 yards from San Cristobal Island , and despite their best efforts , officials said 200,000 gallons of engine fuel had already leaked from the hull , endangering sea lions , pelicans , crabs and other species .
The best thing that you can do is take care of the oil here at the source of pollution , where it 's concentrated .
Ed Stanton heads a U.S. Coast Guard team , sent here at Ecuador 's request .
From Mobile , Alabama , they 're trying , against the odds , to pump any remaining fuel from the ship so that it wo n't spill into the ocean , too .
You become sympathetic and empathetic with the people that are here .
They 've never experienced anything like this , and for them , it 's an emotional turmoil .
Indeed , hundreds of people from around the Galapagos gathered in the harbor here to help in any way they could .
Fishermen in their boats , trying to clean up the waters .
Others trying to clean up shorelines , saving birds , all by hand .
How many animals have you cleaned off ?
This is the fourth one .
The `` Jessica '' was here to deliver fuel for tour boats , which bring many of the island 's 45,000 visitors .
In other words , the environment here was damaged , in part , because so many people come to marvel at it .
The Galapagos are hallowed ground to many scientists , for it was here that Charles Darwin derived his theory of natural selection .
Now many of the fish he saw are in danger because pollutants could sink and kill the algae on which underwater life depends , but late today , the news was encouraging -- that wind and currents were carrying most of the spill away from land .
I have a mixture of anxiety about the situation , and also relief , though .
We 've been lucky .
Lucky , but only up to a point .
This place has suffered its worst crisis in decades , and found itself almost helpless to protect itself .
Ned Potter , ABC News , on San Cristobal in the Galapagos Islands .
And now making hockey history --
the record for most victories by a goaltender in the National Hockey League has been held by Terry Sawchuck of the Detroit Red Wings since 1961 , and now comes Patrick Roy of the Colorado Avalanche .
Here 's ABC 's Brian Rooney .
In 16 years with the National Hockey League , Patrick Roy has stopped the other team from scoring 21,000 times , frequently doing the impossible .
Do you believe that ?
Highway robbery .
And the amazing thing is , he almost never sees the puck .
No , I do n't see the puck most of the time , especially when it 's really fast or at close range .
It 's more anticipating it .
He follows the action with his eyes , and just knows where the puck will go .
He plays what is known as butterfly style , splitting his legs , often playing from his knees , filling the net with his 6 ' 1 '' body .
90 % of the time , when you 're coming down on Patrick , all you see is his big jersey and the equipment , and you just do n't see net , so there 's room to shoot .
Roy has his quirks .
He talks to the goalposts and refuses to step on the red and blue lines .
He writes the names of his three children on his stick before every game , but he says the most important thing is not superstition , not even talent .
I think the passion .
If you love what you 're doing , and if you 're a passionate person , I mean , that will make the difference in the end .
When he breaks the record for most wins , Patrick Roy will replace Detroit 's late Terry Sawchuk in the record books .
From George Vezina in the to Gump Worsely , who had a face stitched like a quilt , and Roy 's hero , Rogie Vachon , pioneer of an aggressive style , the goalie has been the loner of the end of the rink .
They used to play without a mask , but now the game is faster and the puck flies at 100 miles an hour .
Years ago , the goaltenders were kind of the guys that could n't play defense , could n't play forward , maybe were n't good skaters , so they put them in net .
Today , I think they 're as good an athlete as any other player on the team .
And Patrick Roy has established a standard that the goalie has to be an athlete on a par with the best of any sport .
He has won the Stanley Cup three times .
I just wanted to survive , you know .
I just wanted to break that league and survive in it as long as I could , and being in that position today is something big for me .
He loves to play , which is just another thing that might make him the greatest goalie the game has ever had .
Brian Rooney , C News , Denver .
The government said today it 's going to cut back on the enormous number of people who descended on Yemen to investigate the attack on the `` USS Cole . ''
So many people from several agencies wanting to participate that the Yemenis are feeling somewhat overwhelmed in their own country .
Investigators have come up with another theory on how the terrorists operated .
ABC 's John Miller on the house with a view .
High on a hillside , in a run - down section of Aden , the house with the blue door has a perfect view of the harbor .
American and Yemeni investigators believe that view is what convinced a man who used the name Abdullah to rent the house several weeks before the bombing of the `` USS Cole . ''
Early on investigators theorized it was an inside job and much of the focus was on employees of the Mansoon shipping company , which was under contract by the Navy to refuel U.S. warships and would have had advance information about the `` Cole 's '' arrival .
Now the FBI believes all the terrorists needed to do was look out the window , to go through precisely the same drill , well before the `` Cole '' arrived .
The man in this house would have had plenty of time to signal two bombers waiting with the boat across the bay .
Investigators say clues collected over the last few days have already pointed them to locations both near and far outside the port city of Aden , but they wo n't say there 's any indication that the plot here goes beyond Yemen 's boarders .
Learning the true identities of those involved in the bombing would help answer that question , but the two suicide bombers died in the attack , and after the explosion , the man who lived behind the blue door simply vanished .
John Miller , ABC News , Aden .
You have a child in the service and the waiting is hell .
It today , the first bodies , seven sailors are confirmed dead 10 presumed dead .
Arrived at that very familiar stopover air base at Ramstein in Germany on their way home .
From Ramstein , the bodies will go to the Cole 's home port , Norfolk , Virginia , just as Fleet Week is beginning to celebrate the anniversary of the American Navy .
Celebration will also be commemoration .
In Yemen today , where the ship was attacked , the deliberate , well - organized familiar effort to find out who did it , and how it happened .
ABC 's Morton Dean is in Aden .
The damaged ship , the huge hole in its side now covered by canvas , sat in calm seas today .
Unseen from land was a frenzy of activity , including divers searching for bodies and searching for clues --
Its might rivaled the explosion that blew apart the federal office acknowledge in Oklahoma City .
Only such a potent force , they theorize , could have ripped `` Cole 's '' steel hull , collapsed some of the war ship 's interior sections , and destroyed some of its vital communications .
Investigators are heading into this steamy port city to begin analyzing the theories while assembling the facts .
A U.S. official here praised the Yemen government , saying it was doing its part .
The Yemenis have been very cooperative in providing additional security , both in the harbour , on land and to our people .
In recent months , there have been anti-U.S. and anti-Israel demonstrations in Yemen , despite efforts to establish more friendly ties .
One major factor in the improved relationship between the United States and Yemen involves Iraq .
Yemen agreed that when the U.S. intercepted ships suspected of violating the trade embargo against Iraq , the ships could be brought into port here .
The Navy said today , all of the bodies recovered so far are on their way home , and all of the injured have now been transferred elsewhere for further medical care .
Morton Dean , ABC News , Yemen .
Off the coast of Ecuador , a U.S. Coast Guard team has arrived to help clean up the damage from a serious oil spill in the Galapagos Islands .
Officials fear it is a major environmental disaster in the making .
They are one of the world 's environmental marvels --
Isolated 600 miles off the northwest coast of South America , the Galapagos Islands are famed for their wildlife .
Its giant tortoises and rare species of birds inspired Charles Darwin 's theory of evolution .
Today they are threatened by a tanker that was carrying fuel to the islands .
It ran aground last week and began spilling oil Friday .
Already 120,000 gallons of fuel are believed to have leaked , damaging wildlife on the Galapagos ' eastern-most islands , San Cristobal .
Ecuador 's Environmental Minister Rodolfo Rendon , is on the islands .
We spoke to him by phone .
It is a very , very serious environmental problem , and we are working so it wo n't be a disaster .
Officials say currents are pushing the spill toward one of the largest colonies of sea lions .
Ecuadorian crews are trying to control the leak by setting up a fence to trap it , and using chemicals to neutralize .
They are also taking oil off the grounded tanker , but so far they 've only managed to retrieve 20,000 gallons .
Tens of thousands more are still on board .
The Bridgestone / Firestone Company today blamed a combination of factors for the flawed tires linked to more than 150 deaths .
Firestone says there was a design flaw .
The pockets between the tread on the tire shoulder are too steep .
The company also blamed consumers who underinflate their tires , Ford -- for recommending a low tire pressure and the manufacturing process at one plant in Decatur , Illinois .
ABC 's Bob Jamieson is in Decatur tonight .
Few workers were inside the Decatur plant today , virtually closed for the next two weeks because Firestone sales have plummeted .
Firestone 's finding that the process , not the quality of workmanship that brought about the failures has brought a sense of relief .
Many feared that Firestone would close the plants for work .
It 's always been a concern , being pointed to and singled out as a problem plant .
Firestone is Decatur 's third - largest employer .
Though one - fourth of the workers were laid off , the tiremaker still employs 1,400 .
It 's very good news .
It 's very good news for us .
Economic Development Director Richard Eggars lobbied Firestone to keep the plant open .
In terms of payroll and selective services , Firestone infuses approximately $ 5 million a month into the local economy .
But in the tidy , modest neighborhoods where Firestone workers live , the damage has already been done .
Until the problems , Firestone was a family business for the Coppenbargers .
Richard and Shirley , together , have nearly 60 years on the job .
Richard Jr. had 14 months , before he was laid off in October .
The job -- it 's a big history here in the family , so to speak , following my parents here .
My job meant more to me than just a paycheck .
I am worried .
I 'd like to finish out until my actual retirement , when I was really ready to quit , but , yeah , I have some doubts .
It is an uncertain Christmas here .
The report absolves the workers , they know their jobs will only be safe if Firestone restores faith in its products and sells more tires .

Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said today he will stop diplomatic contacts with Yasser Arafat until after the Israeli election on February .
Just yesterday , he had agreed to meet with the Palestinian leader this coming week in Sweden .
The announcement triggered harsh words from Arafat at the Davos World Economic Forum , where he spoke with Israeli elder statesman Shimon Peres .
Israeli Prime Minister Barak says he will resign tomorrow .
Sometimes things are not as they seem .
This is one of them .
This is a political chess move .
ABC 's Gillian Findlay is in Israel tonight .
It was an emotional speech and one that Israelis had not expected .
`` Tomorrow morning I will inform the President of my decision to resign , '' said Mr. Barak .
`` I will ask again for the trust of the Israeli people . ''
That trust has plummeted in the year and a half since Barak came to power .
Failed peace talks with the Palestinians and the violence that has followed weakened him , strengthened the speculation that former Prime Minister Netanyahu might return to politics and try to unseat him .
Mr. Netanyahu would win easily according to polls .
That may be why Barak has chosen to resign now .
Israel was headed towards an early general election .
By announcing his resignation , Barak has ensured it will be a different election , a special election for Prime Minister only .
Mr. Netanyahu will not be eligible .
That 's because under Israel 's election rules , only a sitting member of parliament can run in a special election .
Mr. Netanyahu gave up his seat when he lost the last election .
Thanks , Gillian Findlay in Israel .
Former Iranian hostage Terry Anderson and the families of seven other former hostages will soon begin receiving compensation for their suffering .
ABC 's Jim Sciutto has the story .
His death at the hands of Iranian - backed militants was one of the most powerful images of the Lebanese civil war .
Now after 11 years and a long legal battle , Colonel William Higgins ' widow will soon receive $ 55 million in damages from Iran .
If this is one way that we can send the signal that terrorists need to be held accountable for what they do , that 's what this is about .
It 's about justice .
It 's about punishment .
Terry Anderson , who spent nearly seven years as a hostage in Lebanon , will get $ 41 million .
And Joseph Cicippio , who spent coder , the service is free .
Five years there , $ 30 million .
U.S. victims of terrorism have been able to sue foreign governments since 1996 , but under legislation passed this month , many victims will actually get their money .
The money , at least at first , will come from the U.S. treasury .
The government expects to get it back from frozen Iranian assets held in this country .
It sends a message to terrorist states like Iran or Cuba .
You ca n't get away with this .
You 're going to pay a price .
The bill is now on the President 's desk .
He 's expected to sign it .
Jim Sciutto , ABC News , Washington .
In Yemen today , Navy divers cut through the deck of the `` USS Cole '' to remove the last four sailors who died in the attack .
Their bodies will head home tomorrow .
On Capitol Hill today , senators were asking the general who sent the `` USS Cole '' into the port of Aden in Yemen , why he made that decision .
Here 's ABC 's John M Wethy .
The man who opened the door for American warships to use the port of Aden made no apologies today .
The refueling of that ship in Aden was my decision .
I want to be clear .
I pass that buck on to nobody .
The one question all of us keep hearing , Why Yemen ?
The threat conditions in Aden the specific threat conditions , were actually better than we had elsewhere .
General Zinni said all her ports , from the Suez Canal to the Persian Gulf , had their own problems , either credible terrorists threats , unstable governments , or harbors jammed with small boats , plus , the government of Yemen wanted better relations with the U.S. and had begun taking steps to control local terrorist activity , but improved relations , Zinni said , did not blind the U.S. to the risks .
I do n't want anyone to think we ever in any instance , anywhere , ever took a risk for the purpose of a better relationship with a country and put a soldier , sailor , airman or marine at risk for that reason .
Absolutely not .
Some Republican senators wondered why the `` Cole '' and other ships were not routinely taking the far safer approach of refueling at sea ?
I think I 'm hearing you say , `` we do n't have enough tankers to be sure that we could do that . ''
That 's my sense , Senator .
The general had one more troubling message .
Terrorists are getting smarter , using nastier weapons , and as long as they are willing to die in their attacks , it will be virtually impossible to stop them all .
John M Wethy , ABC News , the Pentagon .
We 're going to take `` a closer look '' at the man who will be inaugurated tomorrow .
He won the election .
He has a clear and powerful mandate for change .
He will be the President of Mexico .
Vincente Fox .
This is an enormous event for Mexico which has been ruled for seven decades by the same party .
It 's a very important new chapter for Mexican - American relations , because Mr. Fox is promising revolutionary change .
ABC 's Sam Donaldson has recently been to Mexico to see him .
The 58 - year - old man who becomes President of Mexico tomorrow , strikingly handsome , wily in the ways of modern politics , enormously appealing as a symbol of change , has big plans .
I dream about so many things that we can do , eradicating poverty , eradicating crime , violence , corruption .
I believe in people .
I believe in the fact that people can change themselves .
Mexicans were voting for change on election Day , no doubt about it , but it is also clear Mexicans were voting for a man who has charmed and fascinated them , who has become their political Messiah .
Fox comes from a farming and ranching family .
His grandfather was an Irishman , but as a young man , Fox left the fields to work for the Coca - Cola company in Mexico City .
I started as a route salesman working for the company .
Ten years later , I was the president of the company .
How do you get to be president of a company in ten years when you start at the age of 22 ?
Working hard , working hard , man .
But it will clearly take much more than hard work to make changes that will affect not only Mexico but the United States .
He says he will drive out the drug traffickers .
He promised to reduce poverty , which could mean an open border with the United States since fewer Mexicans would want to cross over for jobs .
He 's even promised to stamp out corruption .
Corruption is the evil of all evils .
When you were campaigning , you called the opposition , the PRI , `` blood suckers , '' `` black adders , '' `` leaches . ''
Do you mean that ?
I am inviting them to govern with them together .
But why should they help you ?
You beat them .
You destroyed their power base .
Well , I 'm sure in their heart they still love Mexico .
Many people here believe Fox is naive .
The danger is probably he can not deliver the promises that he made during the campaign .
Javier Trevino was the campaign manager for the ruling party candidate Fox beat .
If these frustrations occur , what do you think Vincente Fox will do ?
Nobody knows , exactly , because nobody knows Vincente Fox as President .
Many of them say to me , `` Fox is naive .
He 's not going to be able to do it , and he may go off half - cocked . ''
Well , those who have not been able to do things for 71 years are not the best advice I can get .
I know we Mexicans can .
Optimistic and ha charging , Fox takes office tomorrow acting like a man who , indeed , believes he can defy the odds and make his dreams for Mexico come true .
Sam Donaldson , ABC News , on horseback in Mexico .
Also today in Norway , South Korean President Kim Dae jung was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize .
Kim received the award for improving ties between North and South Korea .
The 75 - year - old leader pledged to devote the rest of his life to the reunification of his homeland .
We 'll begin with the `` USS Cole . ''
There has been the first break in the case .
Morton Dean reports in Yemen .
The investigation into the attack which crippled the ship took a positive turn when Yemeni investigators discovered bomb making equipment in a house said to be close to the port where the ship is anchored .
The two men who briefly lived in the house are reportedly missing .
Yemeni authorities say the men , not believed to be Yemenis , are linked to the attack .
Eyewitnesses say the attack was caused by two men on a suicide mission .
U.S. sources confirm key details of the report tonight , but Ambassador Barbara Bodine would only say the investigation is progressing .
Throughout this investigation we 're going to be making significant progress day to day and certainly from yesterday to today , it has been a quantum leap .
How destructive the bomb was became even more painfully apparent today .
Six more bodies have been recovered .
They had been trapped in a tangled mass of steel above and below the water line .
Six sailors are still missing .
The horror and the heroics on the `` USS Cole , '' when the massive bomb ripped through the ship , were relived this evening by one of the crew , Lieutenant Ann Chamberlain .
I just felt a large -- not so much a bang , but , to me , from where I was , it seemed like something had rammed the ship .
Now that investigators have had their first major break , the confidence level here has risen , but U.S. officials still warn a long investigation lies ahead .
Morton Dean , ABC News , Yemen .
We will have live coverage of tomorrow 's memorial service for the sailors who died on the `` USS Cole , '' Eastern time .
In Africa , the capital of the Ivory Coast is being torn apart .
Massive demonstrations drove the military from power and two opposition leaders are fighting to fill the void .
Christian and Muslim mobs are fighting it out in the streets .
At least 60 people have been killed in only two days .
We 're going to take a closer look at one of the ways in which this unresolved election will have a consequence .
The Clinton administration said it did n't think the delay would affect the presidential transition .
Washington remembers how ill - prepared the Clintons were when they first came to the White House .
The whole point is to have an efficient governing apparatus in place and ready to go .
3,000 of the most important jobs are to be filled .
It is time - consuming at the very least .
Here 's ABC 's John Martin .
The government is ready .
There are two floors of offices , 540 work stations , about $ 700,000 worth of rented space .
We will give to the head of transition for the President - elect , this key .
The General Services Administration has the tools , just not the names .
You see a small gold chip on it , and that tells us who you are , and it tells us you 're authorized to go in , and it opens the door .
But there 's not a lot of time .
Some Clinton administration appointees are leaving already .
Stephen Preston , general counsel to the Navy , for example , is going back to his old law firm .
he will have to be replaced along with all the others , but it takes time for the FBI to check newcomers ' backgrounds , time for the Senate to approve the most important 600 , so they can get to work in the top agency positions .
If you do n't have those filled , you basically lose the connection .
You decapitate the federal government .
Every day counts .
Every day right now is equal to a week next year .
Time is especially tight for the Bush team .
Republicans have not held the White House for eight years , so they will be starting from scratch .
Governor Bush will have empty offices everywhere , and the executive can not operate except through staff , and if he has n't had staff cleared on Inauguration Day , he is really crippled .
Al Gore has the luxury of being able to ask some Clinton appointees to stay on , but he still has little time to waste .
The senators are going to go through every nominee with a fine - tooth comb .
Robert Reich was on the 1992 Clinton transition team and wound up in the cabinet .
Even without a close election , it took Bill Clinton six weeks to make his first appointments .
And that can be a problem .
The new President has to get a State of the Union Message ready and prepare his first budget .
All of that has to happen right away .
So , the clock is ticking , except here in the transition office , where it makes no sound .
But everybody knows -- time is of the essence .
John Martin , ABC News , Washington .
The White House said today it is taking steps to make sure the transition proceeds as efficiently as possible .
abcnews.com has details of what it takes to complete a very complex process .
Finally this evening -- the auctioneers .
Here in New York today , the gigantic international auction house Sotheby 's pleaded guilty to price - fixing with Christie 's -- its only real competition in an industry that does $ 4 billion in business every year .
This is a case of the rich and the powerful stifling competition .
Here is ABC 's Aaron Brown .
Sold for $ 200,000 .
Diana Brooks was at home on center stage in the toney world of high - priced art .
As President of Sotheby 's , she often conducted the biggest , the highest profile auctions , like the Kennedy family treasures , herself .
Sold for $ 95,000 .
Today , she took center stage in a far grittier place , pleading guilty to bilking hundreds of wealthy art patrons out of tens of millions of dollars .
Those charged engaged in classic cartel behavior -- price fixing , pure and simple .
The cartel consisted of Sotheby 's and Christie 's .
Arch rivals for nearly three centuries , the two auction houses agreed to fix prices on what they charged the buyers and sellers of high - priced art .
Even arch rivals , it seems , have a common bond .
Sotheby 's and Christie 's are all about money .
They are dealing with art , history and beautiful things , but at the end of the day , people go to Sotheby 's and Christie 's because they believe they can get best price for them .
They have already agreed to pay more than $ 500 million to settle the civil suits spawned by their crimes .
Ms. Brooks , who could go to prison and will certainly be heavily fined has agreed to turn state 's evidence , turning against her boss .
She becomes Sammy `` the bull '' Gravano with better taste , and the art world , well , while being more careful , perhaps , it continues to do business with the same two companies who for years swindled them .
I think the impact has been negligible .
Much to a lot of people 's surprise , business seems to be booming .
Consignments still seem to be as high as they were before the scandal broke .
Which may be the clearest proof yet that the rich are different from the rest of us .
$ 1.3 million .
Aaron Brown , ABC News , New York .
In the Middle East , another setback in the peace process .
Senior Palestinian security officials said today they can do nothing to quell the unrest until Israel lifts its blockade in the West Bank and Gaza Strip .
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators are scheduled to meet tomorrow in Egypt with CIA chief George Tenet but top - level officials , who were originally expected to participate in the meeting , will not be there .
President Clinton is off to Asia .
He 'll go first to Brunei for a meeting of Asia - Pacific nations , then to Vietnam Thursday .
Mr. Clinton will be the first U.S. President to visit the country since the Vietnam War ended in 1975 .
-- has in the world , one in the Middle East is all too obvious , and as of is in broadcast tonight , the Clinton administration is not making much progress getting Palestinians and Israelis to lay off each other and talk about it .
The other is North Korea .
Today , after a year working the problem , the Clinton administration and the highest ranking official from there that 's ever been here have had discussions , described to us as direct , and positive and warm .
We 'll get to Korea in a minute .
There is no substantial change for the better in the Middle East tonight .
Israelis and Palestinians still having the series of running battles to confirm each other 's worst , even stereotype view of the other .
ABC 's Gillian Finley begins in Palestinian Gaza .
In Gaza today , Israeli soldiers opened fire on school boys , throwing stones .
A 12 - year - old is in critical condition .
In Ramallah , troops battled older students in what has become a daily event here , but for the first time today , Israel 's military said the level of violence was significantly lower , and Prime Minister Barak held open the possibility that the harsh action he has been threatening may not be needed .
If there is a beginning of change , he said , we will take that into consideration .
I think it helps .
I think we need relative calm to work out these things .
Relative calm may have come to the Palestinian territories , but in Israel itself , tension is growing , particularly at night .
In many cities , angry crowds roam the streets , Jews and Palestinians looking for confrontation .
Last night in Tel Aviv , Jews attacked a restaurant that employs Palestinians .
`` we want war , '' the crowd chanted .
Today , one newspaper headline warned of civil war .
Israelis have so often felt insulated from this kind of violence .
The last 13 days have changed all of that .
Gillian Findlay , ABC News , Jerusalem .
In space another chapter unfolding , the final chapter of what was once a shining symbol of the future , Russia 's failing space station Mir .
Today the oft - troubled craft was gassed up , so to speak , for the last time .
Here 's ABC 's Mike Lee .
It looked like a slow - motion video game .
It was the nose camera on the unmanned Progress shipped inched closer to the abandoned Mir Station , space history was being made .
This long suffering , long deteriorating orbiting lab today received the extra fuel it needs to destroy itself .
The plan is for Mir 's thrusters to be fired up by remote control in late February for re-entry orbit .
Most of the station is expected to vaporize as it comes down , some fragments splashing into the Pacific Ocean .
The Mir was first launched 15 years ago .
It was the cutting edge of research into long - term space stations .
Much was learned about construction , rendezvous and docking , the effect of long - term weightlessness upon plants , microorganisms and humans .
American astronauts even worked there .
As Mir grew old , and with little Russian money to fix or replace it , the station became accident - prone -- damage from the fire , gaping holes from a collision with a supply ship , computers broken due to faulty cables .
Now Mir is being made irrelevant by a new , multi-nation space station under construction .
Today 's final fuel delivery marks the last days of one of modern Russia 's biggest triumphs and biggest embarrassments .
Mike Lee , ABC News , London .
The shock waves rushed across the country .
In Washington , where the Gore campaign had steeled themselves to lose , in Texas , where Bush and his team were convinced Democrats on the Florida Supreme Court were determined to win this one for Mr. Gore .
Mr. Bush 's lawyers are rushing to the Supreme Court of the United States for assistance .
There was no major reaction on Wall Street .
Markets had closed .
Everywhere else in the country , Americans were stopped momentarily in their tracks to think of the mess that may lie ahead .
First question , how can Florida count the votes in 64 counties when it took this much to get a partial count in three ?
Let 's go back to ABC 's Erin Hayes .
Peter , here in the capital they are just about ready to go .
In Tallahassee in a courthouse , , 000 votes from Miami - Dade County .
Those votes there had been preparations just in case .
If we use 25 teams , then that roughly adds up to little less than 500 ballots per team , and we figure we could probably conclude that within an eight - hour time .
But then , for the rest of the state , some counties have n't separated the undervotes from the rest of the ballots .
Where to start ? and what to count ?
There was almost no guidance from the court on how to do it .
In tabulating what constitutes a legal vote , the standard to be used is the one provided by the legislature .
A vote shall be counted where there is a clear indication of the intent of the voter .
Exactly the kind of ambiguity that has kept the legal battle muddy and ongoing for 31 days .
We do n't know what the standards will be .
We do n't know who will count them .
We do n't know whether or not she will be counted in time for them to count in the Electoral College .
The court was deeply divided .
Judge Wells said -- the concern among many is that this decision now leads so many questions .
T. would appear very little time to find the answers .
Thanks .
Once again there 'll be two presidential candidates missing from the debate .
Pat Buchanan hardly registers on the political radar this year .
And Ralph Nader , who may make the difference between a Gore or Bush win in several places .
ABC 's Linda Douglas was with his campaign over the weekend .
Ralph Nader says his campaign is starting to take off .
Do you feel momentum from last night ?
Yeah .
Well , it was pretty big .
7777
At a Nader rally in Madison Square Garden , 15,000 people joined actors Tim Robbins , Susan Sarandon and other stars to hear his message -- that average Americans are powerless .
They have lost control of their government .
They have lost control of their workplace .
Nader condemns corporations , drug companies , pesticide manufacturers , banks , landlords , the media .
His supporters say they do n't care that he has no chance to become President .
I want to see my vote as a statement that I will no longer compromise .
Nader says George Bush and Al Gore are essentially corrupt .
Here 's the difference between Bush and Gore when it comes to corporate power .
It 's velocity with which their knees hit the floor when corporations knock on their doors .
Applause
In a year when most candidates are afraid of appearing negative , Ralph Nader attacks his rivals with gusto .
George W. Bush is really a big corporation running for President disguised as a human being .
But Nader is most critical of Al Gore , often when speaking to Democrats .
He has betrayed , he has lied , he has deceived , he has dissembled .
Democrats fear Nader may make a difference in some key states , like Washington and Wisconsin , luring voters away from Gore and handing the election to Bush .
You know , some of the Democrats are going to blame you if Gore loses .
They ought to blame themselves .
Who do you think is going to win this year ?
I do n't know .
It 's very close .
Do you care ?
No .
He says this year 's campaign is really about the next election , about building a serious third party and qualifying for federal campaign money .
Thanks for running .
Thanks for voting .
Nader is never happier than when he is taking on the system .
Linda Douglass , ABC News , Piscataway , New Jersey .
Now Mr. Gore .
He was campaigning in his home state of Tennessee today .
Tennessee is not giving its favorite son a free ride .
Here is ABC 's Jim Wooten .
Not a bad place to be from , and not a bad place to come back to .
7777
And although he has n't been here in 2 1 / 2 months , the Vice President 's here today --
It 's great to be home in Tennessee .
Back where he 's run and won 14 times in 24 years , but where this week he 's dead even or maybe even trailing Governor Bush , who is n't in trouble at home , and who just happened to be in Tennessee this week , too , asking his favorite sarcastic question -- `` where exactly is home for the Vice President ? ''
He may win Washington , D.C. , but he is n't going to carry Tennessee !
That has considerable resonance here .
I think he 's been in Washington too long .
I do n't think people consider him a Tennessean anymore .
Gerald Wiser voted for Bush yesterday .
This is one of a few states with early voting .
You have nine people running for President .
And so did the Wrights , Michael and Carolyn , Independents , but not undecided .
The biggest negative for Gore is his association with Mr. Clinton .
The baggage ?
It 's not an example of a prophet without honor in his own land or even here in his own hometown .
It 's just that Tennessee is a genuine two - party state and has been for a long , long time , and although Gore has never lost an election here , he 's never had a landslide either , and this time , little by little , his once - comfortable ad has been whittled down .
His state campaign director insists , `` we expected that . ''
You 've got a Republican governor , two Republican senators , the majority of the membership of Congress are Republicans .
They 'd like nothing better than for them to embarrass him in his own home state .
So , Tennessee 's most illustrious modern political family is having to work mighty hard at home now and spend at least $ 1 million on local TV ads something they did n't plan on .
Can you come out and work hard for him one more time ?
The importance of Tennessee to my family goes way beyond its 11 electoral votes .
Sure , it 's a matter of pride , but in a race this narrow , 11 electoral votes ai n't hay .
Jim Wooten , ABC News , Nashville .
The explosion in Yemen did not help an already tense situation in the Middle East , but there is the very slightest hope tonight , because there 's word of a possible Israeli / Palestinian summit in Egypt in the next several days .
In news overseas , at a United Nations environmental summit in Johannesburg , South Africa , representatives from 122 nations signed an agreement banning the use of 12 highly toxic chemicals .
Among them , dioxins and other chemicals , which are known as `` the Dirty Dozen . ''
They have been linked to cancer , birth defects , and other genetic abnormalities .
Good evening , the United States is bringing most of its investigators home from Yemen .
Things have not gone quite as the U.S. had hoped .
Nearly 200 American agents went to Yemen right after the attack on the `` Cole . ''
A very high profile investigation in a very tense part of the world .
The Yemenis are worried about the threat to their national sovereignty .
We got our closest look at the damage to the `` Cole '' today , but even as we did , and even as the Secretary of State thanked the Yemenis for their early cooporation , investigators in the field think they have hit a brick wall .
ABC 's John Miller reports tonight from the port city of Aden .
The FBI agents moved out in a caravan of trucks and buses , with all their gear in tow .
They are leaving frustrated .
The majority are going home , some will stay on the Tarawa , a Navy ship offshore .
Sources tell ABC News the agents are moving out because of security concerns , but mostly because the Yemeni government is not allowing the FBI to do what it came here to do .
While there has been a great deal of talk about the high level of cooperation between the Yemeni investigators and their American counterparts , in this investigation , there is a growing level of frustration on the part of U.S. officials , because even now , two weeks into the case , no U.S. agent has been given independent access to interview any of the witnesses or suspects .
The FBI was allowed to visit suspected safe houses and collect evidence and fingerprints , but only after Yemeni investigators had been through the houses first .
Yesterday , the American ambassador and a senior FBI official met with President Ally Saleh to complain that Yemeni investigators were not sharing leads or information .
Some U.S. officials believe the Yemeni are concerned about sharing information that could be embarrassing to a country that has been called a haven for terrorists , but U.S. officials say without access to the witnesses here , the future of any American prosecution for the murder of 17 sailors is in doubt .
John Miller , ABC News , Aden .
President Clinton is on his way to Egypt to attend tomorrow 's emergency summit .
Tensions in the Middle East remain very high after two weeks of violence and the immediate goal tomorrow is to stop the killing .
President Clinton played a supporting role today in New York City , where the first lady , Senator Clinton , was honored at Madison Square Garden .
It was the first time since the election that the President and Vice President Al Gore appeared on the same stage .
Two other elections of interest to many Americans -- in Israel , Ehud Barak facing a vote of no confidence has called national elections for May , which means another deadline for him to make an agreement with the Palestinians .
But first to the serious business --
George W. Bush 's nominees for his cabinet are still getting a going - over in Congress and President Clinton is causing a mild stir here by his reluctance to slide out of the spotlight .
Mr. Clinton asked for seven minutes on television tonight to say good-bye and he will get it , from us .
Here first , down at the White House is ABC 's Jock Cochran .
He will point out challenges facing Mr. Bush tonight , implied and that is some disapproval for Mr. Bush 's tax cut proposals .
He will also say America must stay engaged with the world , and the President will talk about the importance of building one America , including racial reconciliation .
Mr. Clinton hopes history will look kindly on tonight 's speech , but history ignores most presidential farewells .
Exceptions include the first one , from George Washington , and war hero Dwight Eisenhower 's surprising warning about the influence of the Pentagon .
Richard Nixon made the history books , but only because he said -- I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow .
Even the Great Communicator , Ronald Reagan , got only middling marks for his farewell .
America is respected again in the world and looked to for leadership .
George Bush the Elder left by saying nothing -- no farewell address .
`` It would just be an ego trip , '' he told friends .
Would n't be prudent , but Bill Clinton could not pass up his last chance to use the bully pulpit .
This is someone who wants to create a place for himself in the politics of the future , even if it 's simply campaigning at the side of his wife .
Therefore , what Bill Clinton says tonight is said in large part with an eye to his own political future , but for Bill Clinton , tonight 's speech is a real change , for , as you noted , Peter , this one will be short -- very short , only about seven minutes .
Short for Bill Clinton , certainly .
Thanks , John Cochran .
Good evening .
George W. Bush has chosen the person he wants to be Attorney General .
He is the 58 - year - old , soon to be former Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri .
Senator Ashcroft lost his bid for re-election this year .
The senator is a former law professor and former Attorney General of Missouri and Governor , from the conservative wing of the Republican Party , and some of the positions he 's taken as a politician have galvanized liberal opposition to his nomination today .
ABC 's Mike Von Fremd is with us this evening from Austin , Texas .
Mike ?
Reporter :
Peter , Senator John Ashcroft is clearly the President - elect 's most controversial nominee to date .
Many of his positions are bound to upset Democrats .
He said Ashcroft would serve everyone .
He will be faithful to the law , pursuing justice without favor .
Reporter :
The American Conservative Union gives him a top approval rating .
He has voted against some tobacco regulations , against expanding hate crime legislation and against allowing abortions at military hospitals .
A record that troubles most Democratic constituencies .
For a President - elect who is committed to uniting the country and not dividing it , this nomination is one of the most divisive he could have chosen .
We are tremendously concerned that this is a harbinger of things to come .
Reporter :
Mr. Ashcroft has also angered civil rights groups .
He blocked the nomination of Missouri Supreme Court Judge Ronnie White to the federal bench .
Judge White was the first black member of Missouri 's Supreme .
Ashcroft said the judge was soft on criminals .
He had his reasons for blocking a single nomination , and I thought about that , and I looked at the facts , and I listened to him , and there 's no question in my mind that this is a person who believes in civil rights for all citizens .
Reporter :
If he is confirmed , the outgoing senator said he would be an effective Attorney General .
I will enforce the laws of the United States of America with integrity .
Reporter :
Ashcroft said his recent loss in the U.S. Senate race has given him time to reflect .
Political defeat brings more than emotion and pain .
It brings perspective , and today , for Janet and me , it brings a renewed and noble call to public service .
Reporter :
Now this is the first nomination to have been even mildly controversial , but it does go a long way to satisfy the conservative wing of Mr. Bush 's party .
And Peter , he 'll need them when he begins to govern .
Thank you very much , Mike Von Fremd in Texas tonight .
Good evening .
After an exhausting presidential campaign and 36 long days spent fights over the outcome for President - elect Bush , the real work is just beginning .
The time for the transition to the new administration is dramatically reduced .
The stock market again signaled worries that recession may be looming and a sharply divided Congress is poised for grid lock .
Bush plans a conciliatory meeting with Vice President Gore next week and he enters the fray with good wishes from Republicans and Democrats alike .
From the wounds of a bitterly fought presidential contest in history , the President - elect has his work cut out for him .
We will look at challenges Mr. Bush is facing .
We begin where he began this journey , in Austin , Texas and NBC News correspondent Campbell Brown .
Bush spent most of the day on the telephone and in meetings , moving ahead at lightning speed putting together his administration .
Surrounded by friends , family , and top advisors , President - elect Bush and wife Laura attend a private prayer service .
He wanted to begin with a message of healing .
At the governor 's mansion Bush 's new presidential limosine arrives .
The President - elect writes thank - you notes and fields phone calls from leaders among them Tony Blair .
President wants America and Europe to stand side by side in the world .
I know he Britain and a friend of Europe .
Bush also reaches out to Senate and House leaders on Capitol Hill and receives a call from the Reverend Jesse Jackson who talks about healing the nation and election reform .
Bush spoke to Clinton and accepted an invitation to meet with Clinton in Washington and told the President he looks forward to working with the senator , Mrs. Clinton .
All of us have a responsibility to support President - elect Bush and unite the country in a search for common ground .
Bush 's trip to Washington as President - elect early next week .
He plans to meet with lawmakers from both parties , potential cabinet members and on Tuesday face - to - face with Vice President Gore .
Bush has been invited to the Vice President 's residence for that meeting .
Forrest , he has another interesting meeting tomorrow , he will sit down with John Breaux .
A Democrat , he has praised him on his work on Medicare reform .
He wanted to reach out to Democrats .
Tomorrow 's meeting could signal a possible job offer for Breaux .
We realize that many of the people joining us here tonight for this broadcast are doing so to try to get more information .
These are uncertain times .
The nation has yet to elect a President - elect .
It 's something Mike Barnicle said earlier on our air today that caught our eyes and ears and we 'd like Mike to come back here live .
You were talking about this country , how it felt to be an American today .
Yeah , Brian .
There is a sense of I think increasing despondency in the country as we continue on this .
Tuesday night was the longest night and it 's turning into perhaps the longest month .
People are depressed enough about politics .
There 's probably reason why these two candidates split this vote so evenly down the middle .
Neither one managed to ignite the hopes and dreams of Americans .
In `` U.S.A. Today '' there is a map 'am of the vote on Tuesday , the red for Bush , blue for Gore .
County by county assessment of how the vote went on Tuesday and it 's sort of looking at the nation in terms of Wal - mart versus Martha Stewart .
People who believe in school player , gay marriage , people who drive Ford Explorers and who drive Volvo station wagons .
There are these splits in the country ands with as we increasingly head toward litigation in terms of who the next President of of the United States is going to be , more and more people are becoming more depressed about the process .
It gives them a sense of what they have felt for too long now , that politics is just name - callers , increased partisanship , special prosecutors , reliance on lawyers and things that do n't affect the ordinary person , that all that has now mushroomed into something called the Presidency of the United States and how we elect a President .
The fact that as we continue on this road and continue to talk about what 's going to happen in Florida , the judges have really already spoken on this , the ultimate judges , the people .
Their decision is now being reviewed .
Accurately , I think , and what more people seem to be saying to me is that they want an accurate recount .
They want a legitimate recount , an announcement of it , they want a winner declared and they want a transition to begin .
NBC they on Tuesday .
They want a winner .
Mike Barnicle , `` New York Daily News . ''
Thank you for coming on tonight and repeating that for us .
For a late update , live from the campaign trail we 're joined by NBC News correspondent Campbell Brown Ho who 's traveling with the Bush effort , and NBC News correspondent Chip Reid traveling with the Gore campaign in Kansas City Missouri .
Good evening to you .
Good evening , Brian .
Well , Bush ended the day with a big rally here .
We 're just outside of Tampa .
And I 'll tell you , these evening rallies really have the feel of a rock concert , or maybe a pro wrestling match .
You have strobe lights , you have screaming crowds , all designed to make Bush look like a winner .
But he is not a winner yet in Florida .
There is one new poll out that actually puts Gore ahead here .
There are still several polls that say Bush is still ahead in Florida .
Bottom line , as we heard David Gregory report , this is not the position the campaign wanted to be in at this stage of the game .
Bush 's central message on this bus trip across central Florida today was to his diehard supporters telling them go out , tell your friends still on the fence why they need to vote for me , and it 's a message the campaign hopes it was able to convey today , because while Florida is a must - win , they also can not ignore the other battleground states .
Brian tomorrow morning , Bush flies to Pennsylvania , another swing state with 2023 electoral votes , just two less than Florida .
Pennsylvania traditionally , a Democratic state , but one where there 's a popular Republican governor , Tom Ridge , and there 's a lot of pressure on Ridge right now to deliver Pennsylvania .
He 'll end up tomorrow night in Ohio , and then end the week in another two crucial states , Wisconsin and Michigan .
Thank you for that .
Hold that thought , Dafpblet here 's the Secretary of State in Florida .
Good evening .
On Tuesday evening , I requested those counties contemplating manual vote recounts to submit a written statement to me of the and circumstances justifying any belief on their part that they should be allowed to amend their certified returns previously filed by them in accordance of law .
All three counties -- Palm Beach , Miami - Dade and Broward , responded by the 2:00 p.m. deadline today and I thank them .
Copies of the responses have already been distributed .
Additionally , Colier County asked about the possibility of an amendment to their return , unrelated to the manual recount issue .
A copy of that letter has also been distributed .
For the past week , I 've devoted a substantial amount of my time to issues surrounding the manual vote recount .
After Judge Lewis ' decision yesterday morning , my staff and I , along with counsel , developed criteria appropriate to the exercise of my discretion under Florida law .
This criteria is clearly set forth in Florida case law .
For the past six hours , I 've applied these criteria in deliberating upon the specific requests of the counties , contemplating manual vote recounts .
As a result of these deliberations , I 've decided it is my duty under Florida law to exercise my discretion in denying these requested amendments .
The reasons given in their requests are insufficient to warrant waiver of the unambiguous filing deadline imposed by the Florida Legislature .
I have communicated this decision with these counties in letters detailing the criteria I used in making my judgments , and the application of these criteria to the stated circumstances , and copies of these letters are also available .
Because it is my determination that no amendments to the official returns , now on file at the Department of State , are warranted , the State Elections Canvasing Commission , acting in its normal and usual manner has certified the results of Tuesday 's election in Florida , including the presidential election .
Copies of that portion of the certification relating to the presidential election and the signature pages of the certification are also available .
As I previously indicated , I expect that after the receipt , tabulation , and certification of the overseas ballots by the counties , the State Elections Canvasing Commission will finally certify the presidential election in Florida on Saturday .
The schedule , of course , is subject to judicial intervention .
In that context , I once again will be unable personally to answer questions .
However , I have with me our general counsel , Debbie Kerny and two of our outside counsel , Joe Clock and Deborah Blanton and asked them to remain behind and answer appropriate questions from you .
One final comment .
I want to reassure the public that my decision in this process has been made carefully , consistently , independently , and I believe correctly .
I 'm very grateful for your patience and your understanding .
Thank you , and God bless .
Mr. Clock ?
Thank you .
And in Yugoslavia tonight , the most serious challenge to Slobodan Milosevic 's 13 - year rule .
He 's still refusing to concede defeat in last week 's election , so tens of thousands of striking workers are trying to drive him from power play .
Protesters blocked roads across Yugoslavia and so many coal miners walked off the job , the government - run electric company may start to to turn off power .
Milosevic said he received enough votes on Sunday with the opposition candidate .
Milosevic 's candidate says there will be no runoff election .
Finally tonight , humor as perspective , and for that , we depend on the staff and crew of `` Saturday Night Live '' who this weekend took on the deadlocked election .
Here now a sampling .
Good evening , America .
I 'm Vice President Al Gore .
And I 'm the Governor of Texas , George W. Bush .
As you know , this election has been the closest in history , and the results is still in dispute .
That 's right .
It 's in dispute because some people do n't know when they got beat .
Like in Florida , I got 2,910,198 votes , and he got a measley 2,909,827 .
Eat it , Gore .
It 's also in dispute because some people in this race can not accept losing a popularity contest .
Ay if you 'll check the national popular vote , you 'll see that I Al Gore have been proven to be ipso facto , the most popular man in America .
Heck , I 'm this close to having teenage girls throw their panties at me .
But listen .
We may have our differences , but I do n't want to be dividers .
We want to be unificators .
Unificators .
So a solution has been found that 's both fair and consistent with the will of the American people .
We 're both going to be President .
Heck , you all did n't know who you wanted anyway .
It 's true .
It 's going to be great .
Hey , C.J. , roll that tape .
On November 7 , George W. Bush and Al Gore ran for President , but there was no clear winner , so they decided to govern together .
Could they share the White House without driving each other crazy ?
Man , that was cool .
`` Saturday Night Live '' continuing to set the agenda for campaign coverage .
There are new terrorisms concerns to report in the Persian Gulf tonight .
Those in the region are in the highest state of alert after U.S. intelligence has picked up , serious , incredible threats there .
All of this comes as the USS Cole is being carried home , a destroyer carried home on the deck of a larger ship after a hole was blown in its side .
Our report on all of this tonight from NBC News Pentagon correspondent Jim Miklaszewski .
20 miles out to sea , the crippled Cole is loaded on to the heavy lift ship , Blue Marlin .
In this video , the Marlin submerges .
Tugs push the Cole into position over the deck and the Marlin rises to lift the 8,000 - ton warship out of the water .
The Cole will take the long way home , around the southern tip of Africa , avoiding the Suez Canal because of ongoing terrorist threats .
The entire trip will take 35 days .
Yemen authorities are still not fully cooperating with the FBI and U.S. investigators still do n't have any firm evidence to directly link any suspects to the attack on the Cole .
Jim Miklaszewski , NBC News , the Pentagon .
Good evening .
The front page of tomorrow morning 's Wall Street Post .
We 'll report that for the first time since before the Democratic convention , George W. Bush has grabbed the lead in the race for President .
Here 's what they 're basing it on , the newest `` Washington Post '' / ABC News poll showing a 50 % , 46 % race .
Much closer , however nrk our own tracking poll , a statistical dead heat at 43 % , 42 % .
But the trend line is clear .
Over the past several days , Gore 's loss is quite literally Bush 's gain .
So the stakes could tpwhot higher .
Tomorrow night , Winston Salem , North Carolina , seated at a table with Jim Lehrer , both candidates will face off for 90 minutes with Americans listening for closely at home so .
We begin tonight with a new leader in some of these polls , Texas governor George W. Bush .
NBC News correspondent David Gregory is traveling with him .
Bush in Tennessee today where the race on the home turf is surprisingly tight , announcing the endorsement of prominent Democrats including Griffen Bell , and taunting Gore who earlier this year was accused by a tenant of failing to properly maintain rental property he owns in the state .
Tennessee is a fine place to live , I guess it depends , though , on who your landlord is .
Both sides have gone negative , but advisors say Bush will avoid getting personally involved for fear of a backlash , leaving his top aides to attack Gore by calling him a serial exaggerator .
A bigger worry to some advisors is it 's Bush himself giving Gore room to attack his readiness to be President .
Over the weekend in Florida , Bush offers a tangled description of his tax plan and has to turn to his brother to ask if the numbers add up .
I was trying to do some fuzzy math .
Late last week , a labored attempt to give an undecided voter a reason to support him .
I 'm groping for the right answer , as you can tell .
I 'm weaving around .
You tell your friend that I think I 've got the capacity to reach across the partisan line .
Advisors maintain such gaffes are hardly decisive that the election will turn on a general comfort level that undecided voters have with both candidates , terrain where they believe Bush still has an advantage .
David Gregory , NBC News , with the Bush campaign in Greensboro , North Carolina .
We have an update tonight on this , the volcano in Mexico , they call El Popo .
Just 24 hours after its first erruption in more than 1,000 years , the worst appears to be over , but there is still the possibility of great danger to the tens of thousands of people who live nearby .
Our report on this tonight from Kevin Tibbles .
As the sun rises over Mt. Popo tonight , the only hint of the fire storm inside , whiffs of smoke , but just a few hours earlier , the volcano exploding spewing rock and red - hot lava .
The fourth largest mountain in North American , nearly 18,000 feet high , erupting this week with its most violent outburst in 1200 years .
They say it is an especially dangerous volcano because of its steep slopes .
It could potentially wipe out everything in its path .
40,000 people live in the path .
Here at the National Natural Disaster Prevention Center , they are working around the clock .
It is here they take the volcano 's pulse , calling it unstable , saying Popo is simply recharging , getting ready to erupt again .
It 's acquiring more pressure , and eventually this pressure will be released in the future days .
The danger ?
The heat from Popo 's lava flow is melting the glaciers on the sides of the mountain and could trigger mud slides .
It 's like concrete coming down instead of water .
So , they will destroy anything that tries to stop them .
The Mexican government is taking no chances .
It sent out 1,000 troops to force an evacuation inside an eight - mile radius .
Tonight , 20,000 people in shelters , but another 20,000 refuse to leave , worried about their corn harvests or who would feed their animals .
If a major danger was to come , says this man , then we 've got to run .
There 's no other choice .
Scientists say Popo has a huge crater about half a mile across , about 300 feet deep and a lava dome is building up like an upside - down grapefruit .
In contrast , Mt. Saint Helen had a dome , almost as if it was pregnant .
Randy White , who has done on - site studies of this mountain , monitors the rhythms .
It is blowing in its own way .
It could get bigger .
We do n't know how to predict it exactly .
For centuries here , the people have had almost a mystical relationship with Popo , believing the volcano is a god , showering their crops with rain .
Tonight , they fear it will turn vengeful , bringing destruction after 1200 years of peace .
We are joined by the Reverend Jesse Jackson .
Reverend Jackson , we heard a report earlier this evening that the Vice President had dispatched you , or at least invited you to help in the Get Out the Vote effort tonight .
Is that true ?
Well , not just tonight .
Over the last few months gone about 50 stops around the country .
We did massive voter registration , then Get Out the Vote efforts .
I think we were along with the NAACP and others , worked on the Get your Souls to the Polls on the one hand and on the other hand Stay out of the Bushes and it worked .
Do you know anything we do n't know , because so far we have a tight race here ?
A tight race but fact of the matter is that Jeb Bush 's anti-affirmative action action in Florida solidified women and people of color and basically we won Florida , thanks to Jeb Bush .
Our vote in Michigan , we have done about 10 days of solid work across Michigan .
Workers fighting for right to organize and women fighting for -- and blacks together .
I think when Bush made it clear that he wants a strict constructionist court led by Scalia , attacked affirmative action , attack of women 's rights , point this strong ideological line is shown in these vote totals tonight so far .
Reverend Jackson , it 's going to be said , however late we 're at this tonight , and whoever wins it , that it 's going to be so thin , so narrow , that it will be a victory without mandate .
Well , I think what it means is that we must then deal with some consensus issues .
For example , should there not be a consensus that Social Security should be kept secure and not risked in the marketplace ?
Should we not make a commitment to educate all of our children , not just vouchers for a few of them ?
Maybe something as basic as comprehensive health insurance .
42 million Americans have no health insurance .
many Americans die every day from cancer .
Amounts to a vast majority of the American people .
Reverend Jackson in Florida tonight the thanks very much as always for coming on with us .
S did indeed buy herself a Yankees cap and a $ 200 million house and the next senator from New York will be Hillary Clinton .
Kelly standing by in New York where it will be a joyous affair .
As you announced that Hillary Clinton is calling Hillary Rodham Clinton as the next senator of New York , the crowd behind me burst into cheers , the band started playing , and the party here has begun .
To tell you some of the story behind the numbers that will send Hillary Rodham Clinton to the Senate , let me tell you what some of our exit polling data seems to suggest .
As far as a gender gap , voters who said they voted for Mrs. Clinton , 58 % of them women , 47 % men .
Now on the big issue the people thought would be the heart of this race , the notion that Mrs. Clinton was accused of being a carpet bagger , a woman born in Illinois , made much of her professional life in Arkansas and of course has been living in Washington until last year , voters said 52 % of them , that that issue did not matter to them at all .
Also an important constituency for Mrs. Clinton , the Jewish vote .
It appears she has earned 58 % of the Jewish vote .
This has been a tough race , too , where Rick Lazio , the congressman of eight years from Long Island was accused of being much more tough as a campaigner --
A lot of mud was slung on both sides of this race , but when voters were questioned about that , they said -- 68 % that Mr. Lazio attacked unfairly , and 57 % said Mrs. Clinton did .
So that 's some of the picture that makes up the results tonight that sent Hillary Rodham Clinton to Washington .
Brian ?
All right , Kelly O'Donnell , thank you very much .
And about just how this vote went the way it did tonight in New York , Forrest Sawyer standing by with a look behind the numbers , really .
Forrest ?
A few more of those numbers Kelly was talking about for you to look at , Brian .
As she mentioned , men and women did split their vote .
Let 's look at Jewish voters .
New Yorkers know that this was a huge battle over support for Israel and whether the support for Palestine was strong enough .
As you look at this , though , Jewish voters went by a big margin for Hillary Clinton .
58 % to Rick Lazio 's 41 % .
New Yorkers remember the campaign debate where Rick Lazio walked over to Hillary Clinton and said you 're going to sign this pledge about campaign moneys , you 're going to sign it .
That .
Was she attacked unfairly , 68 % did say yes .
57 % went for Clinton , and as for Lazio 's voters , a lot of people said this was a campaign about Hillary Clinton .
Rick Lazio is this other guy .
In fact they asked of his voters , how many voted against Hillary Clinton --
50 % said we 're voting against her , we 're not voting for Rick Lazio , we 're voting against Senate Hillary , and that shows you that , in fact , as Chris pointed out , she really is a tremendous lightning rod .
This campaign was about Hillary Clinton , do you like her or do you not .
Scombrort of Hillary Clinton voters were voting for Hillary Clinton , not against Rick Lazio , and on the which one attacked the other more unfairly , the voters said that Lazio attacked Hillary Clinton more unfairly , and that possibly played into the gap in the Jewish vote , which is heavily in favor of Hillary Clinton .
In addition to the scene that you mentioned , the debate , where Lazio invaded her space , as they say , he hit very hard in the last two weeks on issues involved in the Middle East .
The Republican campaign , not directly through Lazio , but others was actually associating in certain ways Mrs. Clinton 's sympathies with the Arab sides in the Middle East with the attack on the battle ship Cole .
It got out of hand and so this vote could well be as much a rejection of the Lazio campaign as it is also a very positive setting about Hillary 's numbers , and you remember after Rick Lazio had pressed her right in front of the debate crowd , they said What do you think of this and women said It reminds me of my husband or in some cases my ex-husband and I do n't like it and we see that women and particularly working women went by a large measure for Hillary Clinton , and Lawrence , there is this as well .
Opinions about her husband appear to have been important in voters ' decisions .
2 / 3 approve of the job that Bill Clinton is doing as President .
Hillary won that group 76 to 23 .
Among those who disapprove of her husband , Lazio won 91 , and it 's certainly a different kind of race from the Moynihan races we 've grown accustomed to where the question was would he get 68 % of the vote or 69 % of the vote .
Like Hillary Clinton has come out on top by a very wide margin .
Thank you .
It either says a lot about the '' getting elected in this country or both , but Jay Leno has become a campaign stop in this country .
Our report on the new trend from David Gregory .
It 's eight days before the election , and guess where George W. Bush is ?
Hi .
How many in your party ?
We like our champagne on ice , please .
Sorry I did n't name you Vice President .
Something about the background check .
I think I would have a little bit of trouble .
In a dead heat with Al Gore , tonight Bush puts issues aside instead playing for laughs with the late night comedy .
3 , 2 --
Hey , hi , Governor Bush .
Jay , you ca n't light that in here .
The stuff in the closet is highly flamabable .
I think the word you 're looking for is flammable .
Flamabable .
Flammable .
Jay , look at that sign .
The campaign has hit the late show .
Both Bush and Al Gore realize there 's votes to be had joking after dark .
If you 're elected President , how do you prepare yourself for the next four years of Jay 's monologue .
Sorry staff working on the Jay chip .
Really ?
In this case Jay stands for you .
Any political offensive humor is automatically --
Oh , just wiped out .
And you 're not kidding .
I can see that grin .
Why do you think it 's so important to do these shows ?
I think it shows a different side -- at least it does for me .
It gives people a chance to show I know how to laugh .
Not only laugh with people , I can laugh at myself , which sometimes I need to do during the course of the campaign .
It 's an important way to communicate in a slightly different manner to people that are really tuned in every night .
The odd thing about him is , in the dressing room , could n't be looser or funnier .
You 're under a lot of pressure .
It 's a tying race .
Here you 're doing schtick on Jay Leno .
I know it .
Actually , I 'm enjoying it .
I like the man .
I think he 's a unique person .
I think it 's important to have people who help Americans laugh , I think a Leno show is suitable to my personality .
You can take it .
You have a sense of humor .
People say Oh , not a bad sport .
Because ultimately , we 're not a country that values intellectuals .
We like personalities , and if have a good personality , that seems good enough .
That 's scary .
This is more scary .
We 'll be right back .
Here 's a hard - hitting question from Karen .
Do you keep your figure during the campaign ?
Thank you , Karen .
I run actually .
You do run .
What do you do a mile in ?
About 7 1 / 2 minute miles .
Have you challenged Al Gore to a foot race ?
I would be willing to put it all on a foot race .
Really ?
Oh .
Can you come back tomorrow ?
Wow .
When it comes to late night TV , the candidates may be eager to show humor over substance .
If you win , what 's the first meal you will order as President .
What is the first meal ?
Well , if it 's as close as they are saying it is , breakfast , but if the returns come in early election night , probably a Happy Meal from McDonald 's .
Yeah ?
But critics question whether voters get cheated because the politicians would rather face comics than tough questions .
The two candidates , the voters are getting screwed !
They 're getting cheated ?
They got screwed six months ago .
What are you talking about ?
Folks getting cheated .
They 've already been cheated .
They do n't even know it yet .
What do you worry more , losing the election or having a joke fall flat ?
I do n't know I 'll let you know after the show .
I 'm not asking you to vote as a citizen but as Jay Leno , who are you dying to have in the White House ?
I would like to get an amendment and get Clinton back .
Fat girls under the desk .
We do n't see that again in our lifetime .
In our lifetime .
It 's all downhill from here .
It 's like `` Happy Days '' after the Fonz left .
It 's Potsy and rat of mouth .
That 's the problem .
We 're losing the Fonz .
Most Americans do n't yet have a really good picture of Laura Bush .
To discuss the new first lady , we are rejoined by our panel .
David , why do n't you take a whack at this .
Have you ever met her ?
No , I have n't .
I think it is clear , though , from watching her throughout the past year and a half she is more of the traditional mold of predecessors of Hillary Clinton than like Hillary Clinton .
She is not going to try to break the mold like Mrs. Clinton did by taking an active role in policy making .
A lot of Americans were uncomfortable with that and I think ended up being a mistake .
Joyce , it looks like you want to say something .
I quibble with the idea she is of another generation .
Not every wife necessarily wants to be in politics just because her husband is in politics .
That does n't make her a throwback .
, I believe it is probably true , and Hillary also learned in time that it is n't a good idea for the first lady to become too identified with specific policy initiates , at least publicly .
I think she herself pulled back on that .
Well , Deborah , let's us pay proper respect .
She is a teacher and cares about something tremendously important to this country , literacy .
Exactly .
She has worked hard on this issue .
She will tackle the issue the same way Barbara Bush did , encouraging reading .
I 'm sure she will have programs and initiatives .
Hillary Clinton did a lot of things too .
She is out with another book , Entertaining at the White House and Redecorating the White House .
Doing what we think of as more traditional first lady things can be very , very effective .
Deborah , you remember that Mrs. Clinton chafed at the idea of being in the traditional role .
She was not at all happy about it .
In the first campaign she talked about having to bake cookies .
She was n't pleased with that .
That is right .
Joyce makes a good point , too .
After health care reform failed , he changed her steages a bit .
She pulled back .
She began doing more traditional things in public , whereas in private she did still work on the causes she cared about , she advocated and lobbied in a quiet , behind the scenes way .
She did n't make a big deal out of being a co-president anymore .
That is exactly my point , Joe .
Mrs. Clinton wants to deal with policy .
She loves that and is steeped in it .
Clearly Mrs. Bush does n't want to go down that road .
It depends .
Literacy is a big problem in this country .
Nothing that Barbara Bush did or said , with due respect , addressed it in an important way .
It was more of a show .
What needs to be done about literacy is to spend a lot of money , which President - elect Bush proposed .
That was a large spending program , a $ 5 billion literacy program .
Laura Bush could be a big help with that , not like Hillary Clinton with health care , but a symbol with teachers , librarians , people who care about reading and believe every American should be able to read and put clout behind it .
In that way she could be a great asset .
It is a policy that is very hard to disagree with .
She could be the symbol of really doing something .
Let us hope so .
Thank you for talking to us .
If you ask the Gore campaign , the fight is far from over .
Their position was to stand and fight today .
Our report tonight from Claire Shipman .
A confident and seemingly relaxed Al Gore out for a run in Nashville .
Mr. Vice President , did you win the election , sir ?
We 're having here .
He is effectively starting a second campaign for the White House , this one in the court of public opinion .
His campaign chairman in Florida with a tough message .
What we have learned has left us deeply troubled .
Calling for a hand recount in some Florida counties and announcing , campaign will support lawsuits over the issue of ballot irregularities in Palm Beach .
If the will of the people is to prevail , Al Gore should be our next President the .
Former Secretary of State Warren Christopher also pushes the issue hard .
Arising out of this the need for redress to make sure the will of the people can be properly honored in this situation .
And Daley , turning up the rhetoric substantially , criticizes the behavior of the Bush campaign .
I believe actions , to try and put in place a transition , run the risk of dividing the American people and creating a sense of confusion .
Gore officials , meanwhile , under siege by reporters in Nashville .
I think we need our seat belts on .
They say Gore is not simply trying to drag out the inevitable , that he does have a shot at winning with a careful shot of legal and public relations tactics .
New information to report tonight involving the attack on the USS Cole .
Were warned not once , but several times about a possible terrorist attack in Yemen .
With the latest tonight on the investigation , here 's NBC News Pentagon correspondent Jim Miklaszewski .
With the damaged Cole as a grim backdrop to the ongoing investigation , Yemen authorities detained a carpenter who they say actually helped the terrorist load the bomb on the suicide boat at this safe house .
The Yemen President also claims the attackers were members of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad with close ties to Osama Bin Laden .
While in Washington today , a potential bombshell .
During a congressional hearing 's revealed the National Security Agency , a super secret intelligence service issued a warning about a potential terrorist attack .
They talked about one individual and one group which we know the name of that was deliberately going to take action against the U.S. and or Israel in Yemen , and a top Pentagon official testifies the warning was actually , , issued only hours before the Cole was bombed .
That report , as I understand it , was , in fact , disseminated some 12 hours before the explosion .
A second , even more specific warning was also issued a few hours after the attack .
Pentagon officials still insist the flfings was too vague to prevent the Cole bombing but there were apparently earlier warnings as well .
In a separate hearing today , it was revealed a Middle East analyst with the Defense Intelligence Agency also warned of impending attacks then resigned in frustration the day after the Cole bombing .
He also warns that two or three more attacks could come in the next few weeks .
The Pentagon tonight says the analyst reports could not have pinpointed the Cole attack , but there 's a growing consensus on Capitol Hill that officials here should have seen this disaster coming .

That same storm system derailed a fundraisings trip from Bill Clinton , and for a brief time it made it impossible for the head of the free world to watch his Vice President debate on public television .
It was in all not a good day for Bill Clinton yesterday .
Air Force One was stranded grounded by the heavy rains .
At the hotel , the storm knocked out the cable TV .
The President tried the TV in the bar .
No luck .
The President 's aides arranged for him to watch it in a big screen TV in the denial of a big campaign donor .
He missed 45 minutes .
Tonight his bullet and bomb proof limousine broke down .
Repair attempts were unsuccessful .
He was switched to a backup car .
The day got worse when he urged all Americans to vote on November 2 .
The election is on November 7 .
Late pictures into us during the commercial break .
A volcano in Mexico that 's just started spewing molten rock , known to the locals as Po - po .
If you 've landed in Mexico City , you 've seen it .
About 40 miles outside town .
When it started showering ash a few days ago , authorities there started urging tens of thousands of people nearby to leave .
A lot of people however still refusing .
The volcano is almost 18,000 feet high .
Molten rock is spewing , is reportedly setting trees afire , in the area .
And good evening to you .
There is still no clear winner in the election that was now two nights ago .
A recount under way in Florida , and it may not end there .
Here is the status of the recount as of this hour .
The two candidates separated by only 225 votes , with 65 out of 67 counties reporting .
It has narrowed dramatically all day long .
Today the Gore campaign seemed to say the case belongs in Florida state courts .
The Bush campaign chided right back that the other side wants to keep voting until they like the and increasingly across the nation you can hear it and feel it .
The split now palpable .
There 's and among partisan , anger .
Americans remain glued to their television sets , but no answer is coming out and even Cuba remarked tonight in an official statement that it sure is taking America a long time to pick a .
Odd pairings tonight at the White House when all the nation 's living presidents except Reagan were together at the White House celebrating the 200th anniversary of the grand house .
There was George W. Bush 's dad alongside the President tonight for a photo op .
We have correspondents tonight .
First to the Florida capital and legal correspondent Dan Abrams in Tallahassee .
Brian , this was supposed to be the day when we were going to have a final decision , we were going to know what is the result of the recount in Florida .
Not to be the case .
The official results showing only 53 of the 67 counties have issued their recount results and provided them to the state government here .
On the other hand , as you reported just a moment ago , the Associated Press reporting that 65 of the 67 counties have reported .
The problem is the numbers are so very different .
On the one hand you have the Associated Press saying 225 - vote difference after 65 counties .
You have the officials here saying after 53 counties , exactly the same number difference that it was when the recount began , 1,784 , and if you watch the way these numbers have been coming in , the Associated Press numbers have constantly made it closer and closer , Gore gaining ground on Bush with almost every county 's result .
On the other hand , the official numbers that have been coming in keep seesawing .
Bush gets a few more , Gore gets a few more and we 're back to even again , according to state officials .
So when we get the two remaining counties will that be the best number going ?
I do n't know if to be the best number .
I just ca n't believe these numbers are going to end up matching at the end .
MSNBC
Because as A.P. has continued with its numbers the progression has been consistent .
Every time they gave you a set of counties that have been evaluated , Gore was getting closer and closer .
On the other hand , with every group of counties reporting officially it remained about even .
So in the end , Brian , I think the official numbers will be the numbers that apply but we 'll have to wait and see when all 67 are counted by both .
Thank you for that .
And there are still several thousand absentee votes .
And we continue tonight to try to measure just how this story is playing overseas as we 'll be doing each night all week .
Tonight , the anchor of the Israeli network evening newscast on Channel 2 Jerusalem Jacob Elon on what Israelis are thinking and saying about America 's long wait for a President - elect .
Frankly , we are shocked here .
We are used to the Israeli political system , always tied and always tied up , and election nights here too close to call more often than not , but what you 're experiencing over there is really inconceivable to Israelis .
They spend a lot of air time here trying to convey the electoral system to my viewers here , and the election action I got was basically Hey , this is undemocratic .
This is the greatest democracy we 're talking about , and the system is undemocratic , and the turnout as well I felt 's over 90 % here usually , and it 's hard for Israeli citizens to grasp 50 % .
Since we 're talking about Israeli reel and the Middle East , it 's not , you know , the major headline every day , but it certainly was a major story .
On the election day , we had hours and hours of broadcast here live , same as in the States , and we 've been following this story , of course , every day , but here as usual , I might say , we have news of our own .
Actually today , we just had four Israelis killed in three separate terrorist acts .
The peace forces do n't like uncertainty , I would say even less than the stock market , and things here are getting worse day by day .
Israel is usually looking up to the President of the United States for some help .
Some Israelis at least , if not most of them , are still hoping that President Clinton might be able to intervene and help in the short time he has left , but the more things are complicated and uncertain back there in the States , I think more and more Israelis are worried that there 's nobody to turn to , and I think what happened in the past few days among Israelis here is a new perception that maybe things in the United States are not as perfect as they might have thought .
Actually , they 're far from being perfect , and they are sounding and looking to us here more and more like what we know from our own political system .
That insight tonight from Jacob Eilon , the anchorman Israel 's Channel 2 network news .
He took time out from covering the death of Lea Rabin , widow of Yitzhak Rabin .
She died yesterday of cancer at the age of 72 .
Let 's check in with the court where it 's the law enforcement watch .
Dan Abrams outside the building .
Dan , if you had to make a case that it could be tonight , what are the signs ?
Well , I think the number one most important sign is looking at what happened last night , and that is last night at about 7:00 , the public information officer of the court came to us and said we 're going home .
We are told , in effect , there wo n't be a ruling tonight .
That has n't happened tonight .
Now , you know the time is ticking away and yet they are still here .
Everyone still here .
All we know is that justices Breyer and Souter have been seen driving away , but that does n't necessarily tell us anything .
There are all sorts of possible explanations for that .
It could be that they 're not actually involved in finishing up writing one of the opinions .
Remember , very often , the justices are joint in another justice 's opinion .
It also could be that the opinion is already finished , and , of course , there 's always the possibility that it 's not finished , but I think the fact that the public information office and many security officers here at the court are still here tells us that the court is in all likelihood still working on this case .
Dan Abrams , outside the , still active court tonight .
Thank you for that .
Now to the terrorist bombing of the USS Cole .
The damage , much worse than previously believed .
It 's in the form of new pictures obtained by NBC News .
For the first time with the Cole out of the water , the full impact of the catastrophic blast , clearly visible .
In these photos obtained by NBC News , the damage much larger than first imagined , extending well below the water line .
Workers on deck , large sections of the hull buckled inward .
A crewman Sean Powell back home in Florida said inside the Cole it was chaos , it got dark , we lost power , the ship started to list , that 's what scared everybody .
Navy officials predict the Cole can be repaired for about $ 150 million and put back into service , but Justice Department officials say in Yemen , the FBI 's investigation is dead in the water .
Senior U.S. officials tell NBC News the Yemen government has all but shut down all cooperation in finding those behind the Cole attack .
Evidence is either withheld or tampered with .
A surveillance video at the harbor at the time of the attack was so heavily edited it did n't even show the blast itself .
Why ?
Yemen is a terrorist hot bed .
U.S. officials say some members of the President 's own cabinet have direct ties to radical Islamic extremists and terrorists .
It 's hard to see exactly why it is that the President there would ever want to cooperate with the United States and possibly put himself in jeopardy .
Even though cooperation from Yemen is at a stand still , U.S. officials tell NBC News they 're making substantial progress in the investigation and are fully confident they 'll eventually gather enough evidence to retaliate against those responble .
