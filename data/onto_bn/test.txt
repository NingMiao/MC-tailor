Thank you very much , Tony .
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is expected to return to the White House late Tuesday for more talks with President Clinton .
Mr. Arafat made no comment after Tuesday 's first round of White House talks moving quickly past journalists to a waiting limousine .
A White House spokesman said the talks are aimed at establishing the parameters for resuming Israeli - Palestinian negotiations .
Palestinians have demanded clarification of US proposals for achieving a final peace accord .
Egypt 's President Hosni Mubarak has called on Israeli leaders to stop talking about war and to make peace with the Palestinians and Syria .
In an interview with Israeli Television Monday Mr. Mubarak said Israel knows what is necessary for peace , the return of lands captured in the 1967 Middle East war .
He also acknowledged the Palestinian refugees ' right of return .
In another interview Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said the Israelis and Palestinians had made real progress Red Sea resort of Taba , but Prime Minister Ehud Barak has suspended contacts with the Palestinians until after the February 6th election .
Correspondent Laurie Cassman has a report .
Prime Minister Barak 's decision not to meet Yasser Arafat this week comes after the Palestinian leader 's angry speech on Sunday at an economic forum in Switzerland .
Mr. Arafat accused Israel of waging a savage and barbaric war against his people .
One day earlier Israeli and Palestinian negotiators had announced that a week of marathon talks have brought them closer than ever to a final agreement .
After the angry outburst Mr. Arafat reaffirmed his commitment to peace and his willingness to meet Mr. Barak .
The meeting was expected later this week in Stockholm , but Mr. Barak 's security advisor told Israeli Radio Monday such a meeting now is out of the question .
He described the Arafat speech as inflammatory .
Mr. Barak can not risk the controversial meeting ahead of next week 's election .
He still trails far behind the hard line Likud Party leader Ariel Sharon in the opinion polls .

The head of official Palestinian television has been assassinated .
Hooded men gunned down Hisha Mickey at a hotel in Gaza City .
The Palestinian leadership accused the collaborators with Israel for killing Mr. Mickey .

Mr. Mickey was in charge of Palestinian television and the Palestinian satellite channel .
Reports from China say North Korean President Kim Jong Il is planning to announce economic reforms for his country .
Mr. Kim visited a center for high technology business in Shanghai on Friday .
The United States has issued a worldwide caution to Americans warning of possible terrorist threats .
No threats are specified but the US embassy in Rome was closed Friday for what officials called security reasons .
The embassy could reopen as early as Monday .
The State Department periodically issues worldwide cautions .
One was issued last October following the deadly terrorist bombing of the USS Cole Navy destroyer in Yemen .
I am David Coler , VOA News .
Israel and the Palestinians have resumed high level peace talks .
The two sides met into the early hours Friday at the crossing between the Gaza Strip and Israel .
Israeli officials say Israel is still hopeful that a framework peace agreement can be reached before the unofficial deadline , the end of President Clinton 's term in office on January 20th .
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said Wednesday , it is important to help spread democracy around the world .
VOA 's Breck Ardery reports from the United Nations .
In a new report , the Secretary General says democratization has now taken root as a universal norm and that the United Nations should strengthen its commitment to assisting nations that are moving toward democracy .
Commenting on the report , UN Assistant Secretary General for Political Affairs Danilo Turk told reporters the principle of national sovereignty does not preclude support for democracy .
We are usually not sufficiently clear , we meaning the Secretariat , in explaining that sovereignty and final analysis belongs to the people and sovereignty should be seen in a democratic context .
Sovereignty is not simply a quality of statehood , but it has to do with the power of the people and democratic structures which make sovereignty an important human value .
Mr. Churk also has said that a lack of democracy is the root cause of many contemporary armed conflicts .
The Secretary General 's report says democracy can develop anywhere and that it is a common misperception that democracy is a Western concept .
The report was issued in advance of a UN - sponsored conference on new and restored democracies that will be held in the African nation of Benin in early December .

Israeli helicopter gunships struck Palestinian targets in the West Bank and Gaza Strip , Thursday .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said the attacks were in retaliation for the killing of Israeli soldiers .
This morning , the entire world was the witness of a cold - blooded brutal lynch of two or three Israelis within a Palestinian police station in Ramallah in the Palestinian - controlled territories .
Late Thursday , Mr. Barak invited Likud opposition leader Ariel Sharon to join him in a government of national emergency .
It was a visit by Mr. Sharon to a Jerusalem religious holy site that sparked the violence that began last month between Israelis and Palestinian protesters .
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan who is leading mediation efforts in the Middle East urged Palestinians and Israelis , Thursday to show restraint .
Both Jordan 's King Abdullah and Syria 's President Bashar al - Assad charged Israel with insulting Arabs and Muslims by violating their rights at holy sites .
The United States and the European Union will start lifting economic sanctions against Yugoslavia today .
Among the sanctions imposed against the regime of former President Slobodan Milosevic during the fight over Kosovo are an oil embargo and a ban on commercial air traffic .
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said Sunday that relieving the pressure on Belgrade 's devastated economy is the first step towards supporting the new President Vojislav Kostunica and reintegrating Yugoslavia into a democratic Europe .
Russian and Norwegian divers searched the fourth compartment of the wrecked submarine Kursk , Sunday , but they found too much damage to proceed with the task of recovering bodies .
A spokesman for Russia 's Northern Fleet says the divers were only able to venture about one meter into the compartment because of poor visibility .
The Voice of America presents differing points of view on a wide variety of issues .
Next , an editorial expressing the policies of the United States government .
This month 's visit of Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to Washington is further evidence of the strengthening ties between the United States and Bangladesh .
It follows a visit last March by President Bill Clinton to Dhaka , the Bangladesh capital .
That was the first time a US President had visited Bangladesh .
The US is Bangladesh 's largest trading partner and foreign investor .
US investment in Bangladesh has increased over the past four years from 20 million dollars to around 800 million dollars .
Prime Minister Hasina and President Clinton expressed the hope that this trend will continue .
It will depend on the implementation of investor - friendly policies .
Both the US government and American businesses , welcomed the willingness of Bangladesh to embrace innovative approaches towards sustainable economic growth .
Among other things , the US has worked with Bangladesh to establish the Tropical Forest Conservation Fund , the first of its kind in the world .
The Fund will make it possible for Bangladesh to redirect some debt repayment money to projects and at preserving unique eco-systems and protecting the environment .
The Bangladesh government also deserves credit for making significant progress toward eliminating child labor in the garment industry .
The US is committed to working with Bangladesh on this and other core labor standards including freedom of association and collective bargaining .
In addition to growing economic ties , the US and Bangladesh share a commitment to democracy at home and to meeting responsibilities abroad .
Bangladesh is one of the largest contributors to international peacekeeping operations .
Its personnel have served with US forces in Somalia , Haiti , Bosnia , and Kosovo .
Bangladesh is also the first South Asian nation to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty .
President Clinton and Prime Minister Hasina agreed that it is essential for the US and Bangladesh to coordinate positions on major issues , that come before the United Nations and other international bodies .
As President Clinton has said , the US and Bangladesh grow closer every day , through expanding trade , through the internet revolution and through a shared interest in building a world more peaceful , more tolerant , more prosperous and more free .
President Clinton has told a memorial service for the victims of the deadly bomb attack on the USS Cole that justice will prevail .
Mr. Clinton promised the gathering at the Norfolk Naval station Wednesday that those who carried out the deadly attack that killed 17 sailors will be found .
To those who attacked them , we say you will not find a safe harbor , we will find you and justice will prevail .
Meanwhile , in Yemen President Ali Abdul Salay said important evidence had been uncovered in the investigation .
President Salay was quoted as saying two people responsible for the blast were killed in a suicide mission and that the attack had been planned for a long time .
His comments were not immediately confirmed by US officials who are leading the investigation with Yemen 's help .
The US Navy destroyer damaged apparently by a terrorist bomb while refueling at the Red Sea port , Aden has begun its journey back to the States for repair .
As Dave Gavlak reports , the US Cole was towed out of the Aden Harbor to a waiting Norwegian transport ship , that will actually carry the damaged destroyer home .
The American national anthem played as four tug boats pulled the USS Cole slowly out of Yemen 's southern port of Aden .
The Cole was badly damaged two weeks ago in an apparent suicide bombing that killed 17 US sailors .
Security was tight as the ship was towed out .
American and Yemeni patrol boats mounted with machine guns escorted the Cole out to open waters while American helicopters flew overhead .
Some Yemenis expressed relief to see the ship leave .
Many locals said they feared the bombing of the ship would serve as an excuse for continued US military presence in the Gulf country .
Diplomats and analysts have commented that a joint investigation into the attack may in fact strengthen ties between the world super power and the poor , but strategic Arab state .
US and Yemeni officials say they believe Islamic militants may have carried out the bombing .
So far two little known Islamic groups have claimed responsibility for the attack .
Yemeni authorities claimed they have detained over 70 people for questioning .
These include some Afghan - Arab volunteers who came to Yemen after fighting against Soviet forces in Afghanistan in the 1980s .
Dave Gavlak for VOA News , Cairo .
A note scribbled by an officer on the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk has revealed that at least 23 of its 118 crewmembers survived the explosions which sank the vessel .
The note was found in the pocket of Lieutenant Dimitri Kolesnikov whose body was one of the first to be recovered the explosions that shattered the submarine .
Most of the Kursk 's crew apparently died instantly in the explosions that tore open the Kursk 's first six compartments or within minutes as water roared into the submarine .
Lieutenant Kolesnikov 's note indicates some crewmembers survived for several hours .
President Clinton arrived in Brunei Tuesday , getting a red carpet welcome from officials of the tiny Islamic sultanate .
He is scheduled to deliver the keynote address today at the Pacific Rim Conference .
The Pacific Rim leaders will discuss an array of economic issues Wednesday and Thursday , including high oil prices and the boom in electronic commerce .
Welcome to another hour of news and information here on the Voice of America .
I 'm Victor Moralis along with David Chadwick on VOA News Now .
India has signed a series of deals with Russia to acquire an aircraft carrier , fighter jets and tanks .
The deals were signed as Russian President Vladimir Putin concluded his talks with Indian leaders in New Delhi .
The two countries also signed a strategic partnership agreement , obligating both countries to avoid joining political or military alliances against each other .
They also agreed to form a joint working group for mutual concerns on terrorism .
News Now 's Susan Yakie spoke with our New Delhi correspondent Jim Teeple about the Russian leader 's visit and his comments about the situation in the disputed Kashmir region .
He said exactly what the Indians wanted to hear , which is that the dispute over Kashmir between India and Pakistan should be solved bilaterally and that there should be no outside interference , as he put it in this question .
Now this is something the Indians have been saying all along .
Of course , Pakistan wants international attention focussed on Kashmir , and Mr. Putin also said that he supports India 's tough approach to the external violence in Kashmir as he described it .
This is another thing that the Indians were glad to hear him say , and he also said that both India and Russia suffer from the same sort of terrorism , as he put it , referring of course to the separatist militancies in Chechnya and Russia and in Jammu and Kashmir .
So on balance I do n't think that the Indians heard anything from Mr. Putin that they did not want to hear .
What sort of hold does Russia have on India and Pakistan ?
Russia has very little influence with Pakistan , but of course Russia supplies India with 70 % of its military hardware and that was of course the second pillar here of Mr. Putin 's visit , which was to finalize some very substantial arms deals .
In fact , we 're hearing that those deals have now been finalized , that Russia will sell India 300 tanks , T - 90 tanks , very advanced tanks , that Russia will also sell to India some Sukoi - 30 bombers , fighter - bombers .
They are going to allow India to assemble about 140 of these bombers here in India , and they are also going to finalize a deal whereby India will acquire the Admiral Gorshkov .
That 's an old Russian aircraft carrier that India has wanted to get for some time because India only has one other aircraft carrier , and this carrier in particular would allow the Indian Navy to extend its strategic strength much farther than it currently can now .
So indeed Russia does have quite a bit of influence here .
These ties have gone way back , nearly 40 years , and they were strengthened considerably by this visit .
In fact both countries have now agreed to combat what they call terrorism with joint groups .
They have also set up a joint working group on Afghanistan , which is of course a cause of concern for both countries .
Mr. Putin 's visit is the first by a Russian leader in seven years .
Why does the trip come now ?
Well , his trip has actually been delayed for a couple of years .
Russian President was supposed to visit India as early as 97 - 1998 , but of course Boris Yeltsin 's health problems got in the way of that , and then of course , Mr. Yeltsin 's abrupt resignation last year another visit and then the subsequent election campaign and inauguration of Vladimir Putin took some time , so it 's been put off for a couple of years .
But there have also been a lot of delays in other areas .
These arms agreements that we were just speaking about have taken quite some time to finalize .
How does this visit by Mr. Putin compare to President Clinton 's visit earlier this year ?
That 's an interesting question because Vladimir Putin on Wednesday addressed the Indian Parliament just as Bill Clinton had done six months ago , and I think it 's safe to say that Mr. Putin actually probably accomplished more than Mr. Clinton did in the hard concrete terms of arms sales and that sort of thing , but it was Mr. Clinton that stole the Indian lawmakers ' hearts .
Of course you will recall when he spoke to the parliament there was an ecstatic welcome for him .
The Indian lawmakers were sort of clambering over each other to shake his hand as he left the parliament building .
There was none of that for Mr. Putin , but he did receive a very warm welcome , although most ordinary Indians who were actually rather captivated by Mr. Clinton 's visit did not really pay much attention to Mr. Putin 's visit .
In fact his visit has somewhat been ignored and in fact the main news story here in India has been sort of a local controversy over the roll - back of fuel prices rather than Mr. Putin 's visit , but he did do what he had to do and he certainly strengthened ties in a strategic sense between Russia and India .
That 's VOA correspondent Jim Teeple .
In a joint statement Wednesday , India and Russia called for further measures against Afghanistan 's dominant Taliban faction .
The statement accuses the Taliban of supporting international terrorism .
In the Gaza Strip , Wednesday , Israeli soldiers fired on armed Palestinians trying to cut through a border fence .
The Army says it may have killed two of them .
ISRAELI radio said four Palestinians were killed , but Palestinian security officials deny there were any casualties and they say no such incident took place .
US Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has extended an emergency order to keep electricity flowing to California .
The measure will require western suppliers to sell power to the state for at least another week .
As we hear from Michael Sullivan , the official also proposed an energy price cap for the West , but the suggestion had a mixed response from western governors .
The extension of the federal order will require power suppliers in the West to keep sending their surplus electricity to California .
Electrical resources in the West Coast state are stretched to their limit with a looming threat of rolling blackouts .
California 's utility companies are not able to generate all the power their customers need , so they have turned to outside suppliers and in the face of rising prices the state 's two largest utility firms have sunk more than eight billion dollars in debt .
Suppliers outside California had threatened to cut off the power , afraid that the cash - strapped utilities were not able to pay for it .
The emergency order last week and the extension announced in Denver at a meeting of western governors will keep electricity flowing to California through the middle of next week .
The crisis began three years ago when California imposed a price freeze on its private utility firms to protect consumers while the state deregulates its energy sector , but the lifting of market controls led to wild price fluctuations on the wholesale market .
This was made worse by several factors .
No new generating stations have been built in the state in recent years and some existing generators are offline for repairs .
At the same time California has been growing .
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson says it is a case of demand outpacing supplies .
I know in California alone in the last year electricity demand has increased 13 % .
California 's wholesale electricity prices , which had been capped at 250 dollars per megawatt hour in a regulated market , have peaked under deregulation at 1400 dollars per megawatt hour .
With the current price freeze , utilities have been prevented from passing along the increase to consumers .
Wednesday , Energy Secretary Bill Richardson suggested a new price cap for electricity throughout the western states .
Oregon 's Governor supports the idea .
Some other western leaders are not convinced that a price cap will solve the problem .
Energy suppliers oppose a cap , saying instead they need incentives to build more generating stations .
Last week federal regulators imposed a so - called soft cap on California , which requires power firms to justify prices above 150 dollars per megawatt hour .
The measure does not however prevent them from charging above that level .
One large utility company , Southern California Edison says it may have to file for bankruptcy unless government officials can offer some relief .
The privately owned company is now three and a half billion dollars in debt .
Consumer activists are skeptical .
They know the utility recently declared a dividend for its stockholders , but Edison 's Tom Higgins says the firm can not continue to pay high prices for electricity while keeping prices low for its customers .
Our books are an open matter .
It 's not hard for anybody to see .
They can talk to the banks themselves and see that you know , clearly we do n't have the ability to do this .
We do n't print money in the basement .
California 's Governor this week warned that intermittent cutoffs of power around the state may begin as early as next week if nothing more is done to alleviate the crisis .
Mike O'Sullivan , VOA News , Los Angeles .
International aid agencies have warned that proposed United Nations sanctions against Afghanistan 's Taliban authorities could paralyze efforts to provide humanitarian assistance to the victims of drought and conflict .
The new sanctions proposed by the United States and Russia would impose an arms embargo on the Taliban .
Among other things , they would also freeze Taliban assets abroad and restrict foreign travel by Taliban officials .
The UN Co-ordinator for Afghanistan said in Geneva , the proposed UN measure could block badly - needed aid shipments .

Violence between Israelis and Palestinians continued in its third month , though at a slightly reduced level overall .
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators met separately at the White House with President Bill Clinton in hopes of restarting direct negotiations between them for a final settlement .
RUSSIAN officials say Cuba has no interest in completing construction of a Soviet era nuclear power plant on the island .
Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday , Moscow has no plans to press Havana to finish construction of the Juragua nuclear facility .
He made his comments on the last day of his official visit to the Communist ruled island .
Construction halted on the Juragua plant in 1992 , following the collapse of the Soviet Union , which provided funding and technology for the project .
Friday 's announcement coincided with the permanent closing of the Chernobyl nuclear facility , which was the scene of the world 's worst nuclear accident in 1986 .
Israeli soldiers have killed another Palestinian in the West Bank as clashes continue between the two sides .
Meanwhile , Israel has confiscated the VIP card of a senior Palestinian official .
Colonel Taffiq Terrawi , a director of Palestinian intelligence , was briefly detained by Israeli soldiers at a West Bank road block , where they confiscated an Israeli permit that grants him free movement in and out of the area .
Colombian authorities say the country 's largest Marxist rebel group has shot and killed a leading opposition congressman and five others in a roadside ambush in a rebel held area of southern Colombia .
Police say the gunmen attacked lawmaker Diego Turbai and his entourage Friday .
And if you are in South Asia , perhaps you heard the Radio Canada International test transmissions to your part of the world back on the 8th , 9th , and 10th of November .
They were via Radio Netherlands at Flavo , the Netherlands 15:00 - 16:00 UTC on 15360 and 17820 , that according to Andy Senet , via Glenhouser .
RCI tells me that it is not yet decided whether it will start a permanent service to South Asia .
Meanwhile , four Palestinian policemen were killed Wednesday during a nine - hour battle with Israeli troops near a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip .
Meredith Bewl reports from Jerusalem .
The Israeli military says Palestinian gunmen at the Khan Younus refugee camp in the southern part of the Gaza Strip opened fire on Israeli forces and the soldiers responded .
Palestinians say Israeli rocket fire hit a police post and killed at least one Palestinian security officer .
At least three other Palestinian policemen were killed in the fierce clashes , which went on for hours .
In the West Bank town of Hebron , Israeli soldiers gunned down a Palestinian member of the militant Hamas group as he was standing outside his shop .
Palestinians called the shooting an assassination .
The Israeli Army said it was checking the reports .
The shooting appeared to be the latest in a series of targeted attacks against anti-Israeli militants .
Deputy Defense Minister Irfan Sneh said this week Israel now has a policy of tracking down Palestinians who attack Israelis .
Meredith Bewl , VOA News Jerusalem .
Some overseas news .
Barak , who has been forced to call national elections , offered to recognize a Palestinian state .
There 's one very difficult condition .
There could be no discussion for now about who will have what status in Jerusalem .
Palestinians do n't like it .
In Bethlehem , where Christians believe Jesus was born , Christmas plans have been scaled back because of the violence .
Good evening , everyone .
We begin tonight with a couple of urgent questions for the government .
There 's a man on trial in New York for bombing the American embassy in Kenya two years ago .
The FBI says when they questioned him , he told them of another plot to bomb an American ship in Yemen , where the `` USS Cole '' was ultimately attacked .
Question one , did the FBI make it clear what the man had told them ?
Question two , did the Pentagon and the CIA get the message and do nothing about it ?
Here 's your national correspondent , John M Wethy .
In the days after the bombing of the American embassy in Nairobi , Mohammed Al - owhali was arrested by Kenyan authorities and interrogated by the FBI .
He told the FBI he participated in the attack under direction of terrorist leader Osama Bin Laden .
ABC News has learned he also provided details of a plan to attack an American warship in Yemen .
Al - owhali said it would be a rocket attack , conducted by a Bin Laden terrorist cell , and it would come in the next few months .
The next morning , August 1998 , the FBI sent out a classified message , under Director Louis Freeh 's name , warning of a plot to attack a U.S. Navy ship in Yemen .
The FBI message went to three Pentagon agencies , and as a result , the visit of one American warship to Yemen was canceled .
The warning came as General Anthony Zinni was finalizing an agreement for refueling ships in the Yemeni port of Aden .
It apparently left no lasting impression .
Zinni testifying after the attack on the `` USS Cole '' -- Aden never had a specific terrorist threat .
All the other ports that have been mentioned here that we should have considered as options have had specific threats .
So what happened to the FBI warning ?
CIA officials say they never received it .
FBI officials say they did copy the CIA .
Pentagon officials say they got the warning , but had no idea the source was such a well - connected insider within Bin Laden 's organization .
This raises a fundamental question -- if the message had been more clearly communicated and understood , would American lives have been saved ?
John M Wethy , ABC News , the Pentagon , still looking for answers .
The Indonesian billionaire James Riady has agreed to pay $ 8.5 million and plead guilty to illegally donating money for Bill Clinton 's 1992 presidential campaign .
He admits he was trying to influence American policy on China .
Tomorrow 's summit meeting will bring Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat to the resort city of Sharm El - eikh .
Getting both to attend was not an easy task .
The last thing President Clinton did today before heading to the Mideast is go to church -- appropriate , perhaps , given the enormity of the task he and his national security team face in the days ahead .
We do have to try to reduce the violee and take a turn back for a period of calmness so that we can move back to a peace process , but even if the violence subsides , Israelis and Palestinians will still have to deal with an open wound -- a scar so long and so deep from these last two weeks , it may be years before there is a real effort at talking peace again .
Both sides have almost stepped back six years in terms of their statements and attitudes , six years or more -- before the Oslo accords , when the Israelis promised land and the Palestinians promised security .
Today there is only finger pointing .
Arafat deliberately launched it in order to attract the attention of the world by paying with the blood of his own people .
I urge Mr. Barak to lift the siege of Palestinians , to speak to the Palestinians as its neighbors because they are his neighbors .
The Palestinians clearly face the greatest pressure in this summit , since the Israelis are not the only ones blaming them for the outbreak of violence .
I think we all know that Arafat is in charge of the Palestinian Authority .
He has the responsibility for controlling the violence .
But it may not be so easy for Arafat .
Today , thousands of Palestinians are calling for continued fighting .
Half of the Palestinian population is under the age of 14 and many have been influenced by military factions like Hamas and Hezbollah -- not by Arafat .
When you talk about Arafat and the people around him , you have to understand how young this population really is -- how volatile , how close to exploding it really is .
Almost no one seems optimistic about the future of the Mideast .
That 's the heartbreak of this region says one State Department official .
Whenever you take a step forward , you are bound to be pushed way back .
Martha Raddatz , ABC News , the State Department .
We are going to take `` a closer look '' at the great Wind Cave in South Dakota .
No easy matter .
We know caving is a popular pasttime for some Americans , a horrifying thought for others , especially anyone prone to claustrophobia .
We asked Judy Muller if she would like to do the story of a fascinating man .
She took a deep breath and said , okay .
This wild landscape in South Dakota may evoke images of the frontier West , but the real frontier is far beneath .
Elevation plus 11 .
The real pioneers are men like John Sheltons who explore underground caves .
The most fascinating is the maze known as Wind Cave .
When you find one where no one has been there , you are the first person , the adrenaline is phenomenal .
He first came here as a tourist 30 years ago .
He offered to map it for the Park Service .
I thought would take a week or two .
It 's now 30 years down the road .
I 'm no closer to completing the agreement .
The cave is seemingly endless .
3 miles of the cave have been surveyed , every inch logged by hand , then fed into a computer which plots every nook and cranny .
We 're only representing about 5 % of the known volume that could possibly be here .
95 % of the cave is unmapped ?
Yes .
The first recorded discovery of the cave was in 1881 .
A cowboy hunting in the area heard the sound of rushing wind .
He followed it to this narrow opening .
The wind was so strong , or so the story goes , that it blew his hat off his head .
Since then , many visitors have been drawn into this world of crystals , fossils and calcite formations known as forecast work and popcorn and rarest of all , fox work .
Each new discovery means heading down another tight , dark hall .
Your stomach is against the floor and your back is against the wall .
As we crawled along , we found an item left by earlier explorers .
A 103 - year - old newspaper .
The ultimate payoff is when they find a new chamber .
The knowledge that our lights are the first to light it up , our footprints were the first , our eyes were first to see it .
He calls it addictive .
You get withdrawal .
I want to find more , something bigger or deeper .
He no longer expects to see the end of the cave in his lifetime .
That , he says , is just fine with him .

Some camera team as well .
Back to the Middle East tonight .
the truce brokered by President Clinton between Israelis and Palestinians allegedly is in tatters .
Palestinians now talking about a battle for independence .
Israel says it may abandon the peace negotiations altogether .
Nine Palestinians were killed today .
More than 70 people have been wounded , mostly Palestinians , but also several Israeli soldiers .
ABC 's Bob Woodruff is in the Palestinian territories tonight .
Violence ripped through almost every major Palestinian town today .
The worst was in Nablus .
Four Palestinians were shot and killed .
In Ramallah , thousands of Palestinians rushed the Israeli checkpoint , then faced down Israeli guns .
From Hebron to Gaza , the wounded were carried off so fast it was difficult to count them .
As is so often the case , much of the trouble started with funerals that escalated into fury .
Most significant , demonstrators who had been throwing stones this week , today turned to gasoline bombs .
Israelis who had been firing rubber bullets stepped up their use of real ones .
This was supposed to be the day the truce went into effect , when both sides would call off the violence , but that clearly has not happened , and here in the streets , peace seems very unlikely .
Tonight on Israeli television , Prime Minister Barak said we can not go on as if nothing happened , and if the demonstrations do n't stop , Barak 's spokesman said Israel will continue to use live ammunition .
They leave no other way for us but to respond with fire , we 'll have to do this .
Palestinian leaders said their people no longer want a cease - fire , they want their own country .
We are under occupation and subjugation .
The question should be what the Hosni Mubarak are they still doing there eight years after the peace process began .
It is one of the major questions that was supposed to be addressed after the stoning and shooting had stopped .
It certainly has not stopped .
Not yet .
Bob Woodruff , ABC News , Ramallah .
There is other news tonight overseas and at home .
While all this is going on , Mr. Clinton is overseas .
President Clinton was in Northern Ireland when he heard the Supreme Court decision .
He talked to Al Gore on the phone from Belfast .
This is Mr. Clinton 's third visit to Northern Ireland , and the Irish Republic to do what he can to generate a lasting peace .
We have a major development to report tonight involving the crash of that Singapore Airlines 747 in Taiwan this week .
Taiwanese officials thousand now say .
They confirm the pilot made a wrong turn , simply down the wrong runway .
Correspondent Ned Colt has our report .
Tonight it appears at least 82 are dead from what may have been a wrong turn .
Sources close to the investigation tell NBC News that Singapore Airlines flight 6 tried to take off on a runway closed for repairs .
She crash site today , the trail of evidence on the closed runway .
Chunks of wreckage , fuselage , stretching in a straight line for hundreds of yards .
Twisted overturned construction equipment .
This is what the 747 slammed into Tuesday night in a blinding rain storm .
Today investigators say the pilot had confirmed with the control tower moments before taking off he had turned onto the correct runway but pilots behind him say he turned onto the wrong runway .
They say the plane took off , clicking the construction equipment , slamming into the ground and then breaking up .
As the plane was taking off this passenger noticed she did n't see any runway lights .
I used to see the lights going by and I looked out and said it 's pitch black out here .
Reporter Lee , flying in from California , unsure if his wife was alive , today , identifying his remains , and tonight survivor John Diaz begins the long trip home to California .
I just want to get home , never been so ready to get back to the United States .
His flight number a reminder Singapore Airlines 006 , the same flight he survived Tuesday night .
Gregg Jarrett , they did get a unanimous court for this decision .
Absolutely , Brian .
It was very stern , very direct and it left no question , I think , in the minds of anybody that this court unanimously believes that certification should include the manual recount , and that is a clear victory for Vice President Al Gore .
The language here , really leaves no doubt .
The right of the people to cast their vote , the court said , is paramount .
The amended certifications must be accepted by November 26 .
The reason they are picking that particular day is it allows , Brian , enough time for the aggrieved party , the losing party to file within 10 days a contest of the certification and that still allows enough time for the contest to be litigated through the courts primarily the circuit court and back to the Supreme Court if necessary and still meet the December 12 deadline for the Electoral College vote here .
Now , Greg , the only question that means anything at this hour .
We know their view is the hand counts should now be included .
Will it put Al Gore over the top in the race to match and exceed the votes of George W. Bush ?
It very well could , although , I must say that the Gore campaign has been somewhat disappointed by the number of votes they have not received thus far in the counties that are undertaking the manual recounts , Brian , but a lot of hand counts still must be tallied .
We are also including the undervotes of 10,000 in Palm Beach and junt votes of 10,000 in Miami - Dade as well .
Keep in mind , those were not registered by the computers because they either had a hanging chad or dimpled chad .
Those must be gone over by hand by each respective canvassing board .
So there are a lot of votes remaining there .
This is a Gore campaign to the White House .
Greg , just a logistic question , How long is it going take you to get the opinion run to you from the building behind you ?
I would say we should have it here in the next five minutes .
It depends how quickly the line moves .
We have two producers , I believe , near the front of the line .
It how quickly they get handed .
It reversed the two orders of the earlier trial court , Circuit Court Judge Terry Lewis .
The bottom line , this court rules unanimously the right of the people to have the votes counted is paramount , thus , the amended certifications to include the hand counts must be accepted by November 26 .
In fact , it seemed to have some language here .
In fact , Brian I do have it handed to me now .
Let me take a the .
Brian , if for some reason the Secretary of State would n't accept by the 26th , the certification , it could be certified elsewhere .
Gregg Jarrett .
I should point out , he is a former lawyer himself and so can help put this into English .
Greg , go ahead , if you come to a passage we should hear .
I 'm flipping through the summary of enacts because that is not important .
The summary of facts .
You flag us when you come to the first portion we should hear aloud .
And not far from Lebanon , a source at the Syrian interior ministry said that the military commander of the Tawhid Wal Jihad Organization in Syria blew himself up after being chased by the security forces at the Jdeidet Yabus border crossing .
The source said that the man , called Omar Abdullah , also known as Omar Hamra , was carrying nine , uh , forged identity documents .
The statement of the Syrian interior ministry said that Omar Abdullah , 28 years old , was first to open fire with a pistol in his possession , on security men who were suspicious of his identity .
The young man , who leads the armed wing of the Tawhid Wal Jihad Organization , tried to escape but the security forces surrounded him , and he had no alternative , either to surrender or to commit suicide , so he chose the latter by detonating an explosive belt he had tied around his waist .
In addition to the terrorist , as the authorities call him , two Syrian security men were injured .
These incidents took place on the Syrian side of the border with Lebanon at the Jdeidet Yabus crossing point , at a distance of a few kilometers from the Masnaa post on the other side of the border .
The official version says that Omar Abdullah , also known as Omar Hamra , was carrying nine different , forged identity documents .
It is not known whether he succeeded in moving around using them in the past or if this was the first time he tried this dangerous journey .
The man was wanted by the Syrian Security Services because of his connection with an organization they describe as extremist , in reference to the Tawhid Wal Jihad which the authorities consider a twin of the Jund Al - Shaab Organization .
This organization , which was founded in Afghanistan by Islamists from Syria , Palestine and Jordan , is blamed for a number of incidents that have taken place in the country in the past two years .
An attempt to attack the American Embassy last September was foiled by the Security Services and led to the death of five people , including four of the attackers .
The Security Services also carried out what they call preemptive attacks in each of the following : Daff Al - Shawk in the capital , in Aleppo , and Khasham in the Al - Hasakah Governorate , in the north of the country .
They also clashed extensively with gunmen in Hama , the city that is famous for the killing of thousands of its people in 1982 , when the authorities were engaged in quelling the Islamist movement there .
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia expressed its support for the principle of fair geographic representation in the United Nations Security Council , in both its permanent and non-permanent memberships .
It expressed the view that the purpose of developing the Security Council structure should be to strengthen the capabilities of the council to perform its role in an effective way , to achieve the desired objective of the international community in maintaining international peace and security .
This came in the Kingdom 's speech before the General Assembly , in the sixty - first session on articles ten and one hundred and eleven , regarding the Security Council 's decision on the issue of fair representation in the Security Council , increasing the number of its members and the related issues , which His Royal Highness Prince Mishal Bin Abdallah Bin Abd - al - Aziz , Minister Plenipotentiary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , gave yesterday before the council .
His Highness said that the Kingdom confirms the extreme importance it places on the Security Council 's performance of its role and the full responsibility assigned to it to preserve security and peace in an effective way in all regions of the world .
His Highness said that the Kingdom at the same time expresses its disappointment at the effect of the resolutions and work procedures of the council and its double standard policy , which has prevailed in some of its works , especially those related to some security and peace cases in the Middle East region .
His Highness added that the whole world watched the Israeli assaults on Lebanon and on Palestinian lands in a full - scale war aimed at the deliberate destruction of the infrastructure , and violations of human and national rights that targeted innocent civilians with assassination , detention and torture without any consideration for international agreements and treaties or humanitarian considerations .
Philippine President Gloria Arroyo has declared that the Philippines is a disaster - stricken country because of the hurricane which hit the country last Thursday .
At the same time , devastated villages began to bury their victims as officials attempted to obtain food and water supplies .
Rescue teams continued search operations for more bodies under the volcanic rubble , rocks and mud amidst predictions that the death toll would rise to around 700 .
This is how the villages looked , buried by the mud , flood and rain waters which accompanied the destructive hurricane that swept across broad expanses of the eastern Philippines .
At the same time , the country began a relief operation to reach the victims of the natural disaster which left behind around 700 dead and thousands of homeless , injured and missing people .
The country 's president Gloria Arroyo Macapagal declared the Philippines a disaster - stricken country entitled to aid .
She called on the countries of the world and on international relief organizations to quickly send convoys of humanitarian aid which include medical and food aid and the necessary equipment to extricate bodies buried by mud under the rubble of their homes in poor villages .
This comes as the disaster - stricken villages , as a result of the mudslides in the east Philippines , began to bury their dead in a painful picture which reminded the world of the tsunami that struck the coasts of Asia at the beginning of last year .
Rescue teams continued their search operations for more bodies under the volcanic debris , rocks and mud at the foot of Mayon volcano in the Albay province at a distance of 330 kilometers south of the capital Manila .
For its part , the National Disaster Coordinating Council confirmed that at least 285 people had been killed in the province of Albay , the majority of their deaths caused by mudslides resulting from Hurricane Durian .
At the same time , at least 292 people are still amongst the missing and it is feared that they may have died as well .
The council said that Hurricane Durian which hit the east Philippines coast last Thursday with a maximum wind speed of 195 kilometers per hour caused the deaths of 18 other people in the provinces of Camarine Sur , Catanduanes , Quezon and Oriental Mindoro .
A local Red Cross official in Albay said that statistics suggested that the number of missing people could reach 779 people .
Experts said that the torrential rain which accompanied Hurricane Durian stirred up volcanic ash sediments on the upper slopes of Mount Mayon causing severe mudslides which buried the surrounding areas .
Hurricane Durian is still leaving more victims and destruction in its path .
The hurricane caused the deaths of around 1200 people in the Philippines and dozens in Vietnam while authorities in the disaster - stricken areas fear an exacerbation of the situation and an increase in the number of victims of the sweeping hurricane .
From here Hurricane Durian swept over southern Vietnam , leaving no less than 37 people dead after killing over 1200 people in the Philippines .
The hurricane was accompanied by winds at a speed of 120 kilometers an hour which pushed the Vietnamese authorities to evacuate 3500 people from different areas .
The authorities fear the toll will be worse in this flat region exposed to the winds .
On the island of Fukio , winds destroyed hundreds of boats moored off the shore , tore the roofs off houses and pulled up electricity poles as well as cutting off some roads .
8000 people were evacuated from Ho Chi Minh City .
In spite of the deaths left in the wake of the hurricane , material losses and the loss of roofs from houses , life quickly returned to the streets of Vietnam where some shops opened and the roads teemed with bicycles , the well - known means of transportation there .
Tropical Hurricane Durian cut off electricity at the beginning and sank over 800 boats along the southern coast of Vietnam until the storm changed course suddenly to head for south - west Vietnam .
The National Search and Rescue Committee said that telephone and electricity lines had been cut off and roads closed because of falling trees in the village of Fong Tao to the east of Ho Chi Minh City .
The number of people affected by the storm in three provinces was at least 50,000 .
So in just a few seconds , Hurricane Durian transformed more than one province into ruins and carried away dear ones , leaving behind lakes of water , mud , destruction and sorrow .
Clashes continued today in the West Bank and Gaza .
Palestinian gunmen fired on an Israeli car killing the driver .
Earlier today Israeli soldiers guarding a Jewish settlement shot and killed a Palestinian man who was later identified as an intelligence officer .
The Israeli Army said the man had been approaching the guard post in a suspicious manner .
Former U.S. representative Sidney Yates has died .
When he retired last year , he was the oldest and longest serving member of the house .
NPR 's Sheryl Corley reports from Chicago .
Sidney Yates was first elected to the U.S. house in 1948 , when Harry Truman was President and for more than 4 decades he trounced every challenger to face him in congressional election .
He sat out 1 term after losing a U.S Senate race in the 1960s , but for 24 terms , Yates represented Chicago 's northern lake front and northern suburbs .
The congressman was known as a fervent liberal and supporter of the arts and he was noted for his success in getting congress to finance for national endowment for the art .
In 1993 , Yates was awarded a Presidential Citizen 's Medal for his efforts .
Yates was born in Chicago and he was one of the few politicians who successfully walked the tight rope between the Chicago machine and its independent critics .
He died yesterday of renal failure and complications from pneumonia .

With this month 's ouster of strongman Slobodan Milosevic , Yugoslavia is rapidly joining the international community .
Today , the country was admitted into an international Balkan development program .
Belgrade now hopes to join the United Nations , the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank .
At home , President Vojislav Kostunica says that he intends to promote democracy and free speech , but Kostunica just might have second thoughts , once a theater group that roasted his predecessor over the coals starts turning him on a spit .
The World 's Nened Chebeck reports from the Yugoslav capital .
These days at almost every street corner in central Belgrade , there is a stall selling compact discs with protest songs against the former regime , and the most popular tune blaring out of the speakers goes like this , `` attention , attention , last train for Serbia via day stop Kosovo and The Hague is departing with a ten hour delay .
It 's the latest hit by the satirical theater called `` Index '' .
They started off 20 years ago in a local radio station and became an enormous success on stage and not just here in Serbia .
They toured the world and performed wherever there is an emigrant community from the former Yugoslavia scattered by the wars here , from Australia to New York where Index will be returning in late November .
This song is from their latest play , The Last Train for Serbia , which was recorded on the day protestors stormed the federal parliament in Belgrade and the main television stations .
The song speaks of panic in the household of Slobodan Milosevic .
Even before the former President conceded defeat , the Index Theater performed live on an improvised stage outside the parliament , in front of a crowd of some 300,000 people .
Actor Drugewbo Unitich tells how the show began .
The first thing that I told them was please let us close our eyes and just listen .
When they did that and I saw them and I told them in a voice of Milosevic , `` Ladies and gentleman , I am definitely finished . ''
Only 3 or 4 hours after that he appeared on television and said something very similar to that .
Yubitrich is one of Belgrade 's most popular actors and he owes it to his skilful portrayal of Slobodan Milosevic .
Getting into Milosevic 's shoes even on stage , was quite a temptation says Yubitrich .
I always felt when I enter his person , Okay , that I can do whatever I want and I always molested our fellow players you know .
So being Milosevic is something which I can compare to taking a dangerous drug .
But with Milosevic out of the way , what next for Serbia 's most popular satirical group ?
Writer Vojislav Jonetic says he is confident the new Yugoslav government will provide plenty of fresh material .
We will have plenty of politicians , which we can play .
We will have plenty of idiotic situations in Serbian politics .
Political satirical theater is something which you can apply best to the societies , which are in some kind of crisis .
We are still in crisis and we will be I think for a while , but the current crisis Jonetic hopes will at least be one where government critics will not be branded as traitors and be banned from public performances .
Index Theater is planning a huge comeback now with a series of shows in Belgrade , but even though Milosevic is under de facto house arrest in Belgrade , he is very much present on the repertoire of political humors , says his impersonator , Dragewbo Yubitrich .
I would like to share one joke with the listeners of The World .
It 's the year of 2004 .
In Serbia it is 57th round of elections from September 2000 and Slobodan Milosevic appears on national tv and says , `` I want to greet you as your new President , my name is Vojislav Kostunica '' .
Yubitrich says , he has already set his sights on the new Yugoslav President , Kostunica and will most likely be impersonating him in the future .
He is not as easy to make fun of yet Yubitritch says , unlike Milosevic , but that does n't mean he will escape the scrutiny and sharp wits of Index Theater .

In Haiti , Jean - Bertrand Aristide has been declared the winner in last Sunday 's controversial presidential election .
NPR 's Jerry Hadden reports .
Former President Aristide won with 92 percent of the vote according to Haitian election officials .
The sweeping victory was expected since Aristide ran virtually unopposed .
Opposition candidates boycotted the vote citing tainted legislative elections last May .
Aristide was elected President for the first time ten years ago and served just months before a military coup sent him into exile in the United States .
He now faces huge obstacles as Haiti 's leader .
His country is the poorest in the hemisphere and much of the world community has shunned him .
On Wednesday UN Secretary General Kofi Annan called on his organization to close its mission in Haiti citing the unstable political climate .
Though a spate of pre-election violence kept some Haitians away from the polls on Sunday , the voting itself went relatively smoothly .

China released a government policy paper today about population and development .
The paper said Beijing hopes to cap its population at 1.6 billion by the year 2050 .
NPR 's Rob Gifford reports from the Chinese capital .
The Chinese government today credited the one child policy with dramatically improving the quality of life for citizens of the world 's most populous nation .
China 's population currently stands at 1.26 billion , still the largest in the world , but the paper says that if it were n't for the one child policy that figure would be 300 million higher .
The white paper says the economy still faces a daunting challenge coping with the net annual increase of 10 million people over the next decade .
At the same time , it says , China will grapple with problems associated with a rapidly aging population and lack of an extensive social security system .

In what may have been a ripple effect of the Middle East crisis , an explosion today killed at least four sailors on a US Navy destroyer in the Yemeni port of Aden .
American investigators are going to the scene but in Washington at the White House , the Pentagon and the State Department , US officials are already expressing suspicions that today 's explosion was an act of terrorism .
The World 's Clark Boyd reports .
The blast , which occurred just after noon local time in Yemen , ripped a 20 x 40 foot gash in the USS Cole , a state - of - the - art destroyer that had stopped in Aden to refuel before joining the carrier George Washington in the Persian Gulf .
Speaking at the Cole 's home base in Norfolk , Virginia , Admiral John Foley said that the Navy is investigating the incident .
I do n't know whether it was terrorism or not .
It was an act of certainly a severe belligerence but we do n't know the source , nor can I comment any further on that .
But in Washington , Pentagon officials went further saying that they had every reason to suspect that the blast was caused by terrorists .
The officials said that reports from the scene , including one from an Army officer working in Aden Harbor , suggested that a small rubber craft that was helping the Cole dock came alongside the destroyer and caused the blast .
Many , including retired Admiral Eugene Carroll , are suspicious that the small boat may have been loaded with high - power explosives and that the attack was planned .
That craft that approached the Cole is a rubber boat , not a big craft , but they would have had to pack it fully with explosives to do the amount of damage that they did to the Cole and that certainly would have taken time to get that put together .
While both the Pentagon and the Justice Department today dispatched teams of experts to Yemen to investigate the explosion , Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged caution saying it was too early to jump to any conclusions .
Still , she promised that the United States would take appropriate action if terrorists were found to be behind the blast , a sentiment echoed later in the day by President Clinton .
If , as it now appears , this was an act of terrorism , it was a despicable and cowardly act .
We will find out who is responsible and hold them accountable .
If their intention was to deter us from our mission of promoting peace and security in the Middle East , they will fail utterly .
For some terrorism experts today 's attack , which occurred against the backdrop of intense clashes between Palestinians and Israelis in the Middle East , has an eerily familiar ring to it .
Bruce Hoffman is the director of the Rand Corporation 's Washington office .
We have seen often in the past how violence and conflict and tensions in the Middle East often embroil the United States .
One only has to recall the bombing of the US Marine barracks in Lebanon in 1983 , also a month before presidential election , also at a time when Israel was involving suitable ferment at that point in Lebanon now with the Palestinians , where the United States was also attempting actively to provide some stabilizing influence and unfortunately and tragically got caught up in the maelstrom and that seems to be the salient fact of this attack .
And if this attack turns out to be the work of terrorists , Hoffman says it would signal a dangerous new trend .
Maritime or marine - borne terrorist attacks are actually quite rare .
That being said it could well be the beginning of a new pattern .
We have made it far more difficult , appropriately so , for terrorists to attack our ground forces in the Arabian Peninsula .
So , I think terrorists prevented from attacking their targets using their more conventional means ` truck bombs ' have merely adjusted their tactics slightly and obviously they have been successful with it today .
On Yemeni TV today the country 's President expressed his heart - felt condolences to those who were killed and injured , but denied that the explosion on board the cole was caused by terrorists , although , admits Mohammed Al - Qadhi , editor of the Yemen Observer newspaper in the capital Sana , anti-American sentiment has been running high in Yemen because of events in the Middle East .
The people now in the streets are gathering because they feel that not just as Arabs , as human beings , that what is happening in Palestine is not humanitarian .
Regarding the United States ' attitude in this regard , we find that the United States until now are supporting Israel .
The people here feel that United States should do something .
With tensions running high throughout the Middle East , today 's incident off the coast of Yemen serves as a warning .
US armed forces and diplomatic personnel might be on high alert for sometime to come .

Up next a global hip - hop beat laid down in New York and danced to in the West African nation of Senegal .
The World 's Marco Warman has today 's musical finale .
Imagine trying to translate the lyrics of the Sugar Hill Gang 's notorious rap classic , Rapper 's Delight .
Fortunately for rap fans in the Senegalese capital , Dakar translating these tunes is n't necessary .
The city has its own homegrown hip - hop scene .
It is a hip - hop but African hip - hop with African instruments , you know , African chant , traditional sounds .
That is Amidu Barry , one half of the duo Positive Black Soul or PBS .
They are the doyens of Dakar 's hip - hop scene , the Sugar Hill Gang of Senegal if you will .
Positive Black Soul sings in Senegal 's main language Wolof but if the music sounds like it comes straight out of the Bronx , well , you are not far off .
PBS produce their albums in New York .
Lead singer Amidu Berry says New York producers make hip - hop in any language come out sounding right .
They know how to make a hip - hop record sound good .
They know the sound of hip - hop , you know , and they have got the equipment and the engineers and they know how to handle it .
But Positive Black Soul 's music is first and foremost Senegalese music .
When American saxophonist David Murray recorded his acclaimed afrocentric jazz album , Fo Juke Review in Dakar , he recruited Amidu Berry and DJ Awadi from PBS to show what an edge West African music can really have .
When Awadi and Barry performed , they managed simultaneously to bathe in the group of American hip - hop and they keep a clear sense that they are from Senegal .
This connection to national and musical identities results partly from the fact that many Senegalese artists want to stay in Senegal to live and work says PBS singer Tidia Awadi .
It is because they know they have the inspiration in their country .
I think everybody want to stay in his country , want to die in his country .
If you can stay and make it happen , the place where you was born , where you grew up then try to make it there .
It 's possible .
Senegalese rappers are also identified by what they say in their tracks .
Western hip - hop lyrics often revolve around the accumulation of material wealth and throwing parties .
PBS and other Senegalese rap groups have different concerns .
In the grim lyrics to Leboho Inwa , the executioner is black .
PBS raps that Africans are their worst enemies .
Front man Amidu Barry may look like he got his moves on the streets of Brooklyn but his critique of post-colonial finger pointing in Africa tells a different story .
You know , in Africa every time you know something bad happens , everybody like you know is because of the white man , you know the colonization , the slavery .
They do n't realize that you know the real execution is really black 's black like them .
So before they say it is a white man tangle you know it 's because of a white man that this happens and they got to , you know , check around and they say who is the real guilty .
We got to accept it and try to , you know , change the things , make the things better .
Positive Black Soul are now the oldsters of Dakar 's hip - hop scene and they have established the template of social consciousness that many Senegalese hip - hop groups follow like Bootin Bye , which recently scored this hit about AIDS prevention .
Again Amidu Barry from Postive Black Soul .
When we started there were maybe two or three hip - hop groups in Dakar and now today we got more than 2000 groups only in Dakar , let 's say in Senegal .
Two thousand hip - hop bands ?
Hip - hop bands only in Dakar , not the whole Senegal .
So you know it is amazing .
It 's fantastic , extraordinary .
Just how extraordinary can be heard on a recent French recording .
The Hop is a compilation featuring Dakar 's biggest rap stars from Bidu Bubes to the current kings of Senegalese hip - hop Daura G .
That kind of success needs no translation .

Gao Xingjian arrived in Stockholm this week and when he leaves the Chinese born writer will have something extra in his suitcase , the Nobel Prize for Literature .
Today Gao , who now lives in France , gave the traditional Nobel lecture as part of the festivities leading up to Sunday 's ceremony , and on the same day he collects the prize .
Gao 's 1989 novel ` Soul Mountain ' will be published for the first time in America .
If you want to know what Gao Xingjian is all about , as a thinker and as an artist , our international book critic Christopher Meryl says Gao 's masterpiece is an ideal starting point .
His politics are embedded in his writing and his writing is first and foremost a celebration of freedom .
This novel ` soul mountain ' , which is just being released in the United States this week is in every possible way a celebration of what freedom means .
It 's a large novel , full of all kinds of ideas and incidents and stories and tales and a polyphony of voices .
It is , if you like , the whole world wrapped up in 500 pages .
It is the world at its most carnival - like , and yet it is virtually impossible , is n't it , for a Chinese artist to do something or to make a statement without its having some kind of either political effect or be political in origin .
I mean this man took the trip on which the novel was based for political reasons , did he not ?
Certainly .
He is born in 1940 .
He is a product of the Cultural Revolution .
In fact he had to burn up an entire suitcase full of hundreds of poems and plays and stories at the start of the Cultural Revolution in fear of going to prison , and then in 1983 after being diagnosed with lung cancer , which had killed his father three years earlier and being convinced that he himself was going to die , he gets a kind of reprieve .
He gets a second chest X-ray , discovers that he does n't have lung cancer , recognizes that by virtue of the kinds of things that he is writing , his openness to Western literary ideas , that he is in political trouble again , and so he sets out on an extraordinary odyssey of some 15,000 kilometers , mostly on foot , which he takes through southwestern China .
He had survived , if you will , a death sentence , and now in that new freedom of the life in front of him , he takes to the road in the tradition of old Chinese poets and records what he sees , what he hears , the stories that he is told .
The book is filled with marvelous descriptions of the gorges through which he walks , the mountains that he climbs , indeed the book is called Soul Mountain , the mountain on which he hopes in some way or another to get in touch with his soul , his individual soul , as opposed to that mass kind of soul being enforced upon him by the Communist Chinese authorities , the social realism that the cadres would have him write in .
Not only can this fellow write , he can paint too , ca n't he ?
He is best known among his neighbors in Paris as a painter .
He has had more than 30 one - man shows and his paintings are quite delicately done and there he is also very well known as a playwright .
I think he has published about 18 plays now and he writes his plays in French .
Just one last thing quoting him and I wonder if you could respond to this , Christopher , he said at the very beginning of his wonderful speech to the Nobel Prize Committee , he said , `` I do not wish to waste this talk on literature by saying too much about politics and history , What I want to do is to use this opportunity to speak as one writer in the voice of an individual . ''
Is that true basically not only for him that day , today , but of all of his work ?
Well , the work that we have so far in English translation suggests that , and indeed this novel , which is a celebration as well of the self of the individual , goes so far as to even divide up to the self .
Characters proliferate out of the imagination of the narrator so that at a certain point , you have a new he , you have a new she , you have a you , and each one of these characters tells stories , each story of which is designed to give you a deeper sense of the richness and the complexity of life in China .

Thanks , Christopher .

In the other major story out of the Middle East , Arab Foreign Ministers met today in Cairo in advance of Saturday 's Arab 's summit .
Egypt called the emergency summit to declare support for the Palestinians in the wake of three weeks of violence that has left at least 106 people dead , almost all of them Palestinian .
Violence has abated somewhat since the deal was struck at Sharm el - Sheikh two days ago , but Arab governments are under pressure from their own citizens to take a tough stance against Israel .
James Drummond , covering the Arab summit in Cairo for the Financial Times .
James , there 's a reason why the Arabs wanted this pre-summit meeting .
What is the pressure on them prior to the summit ?
Well , I think they want to try and iron out any potential difficulties before the heads of state come into town on Saturday and Sunday .
So this is a preparatory exercise to reach some sort of agreement beforehand .
Of course , the problem is that not all Arab states are speaking again with one voice .
What do they hope to achieve ? and what can you claim from the statements made today ?
It is difficult to say , Arab 's summit have traditionally been exercises in division .
We have already seen problems from Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on Tuesday who appeared on Al - Jazeera , the pan-Arab satellite channel , and , rubbish , what he said was a draft statement for the end of the summit on Sunday .
And he was very categorical that it was too weak and did not harm Israeli interests sufficiently .
So we have Gadafi on the one hand .
On the other hand we have Egypt which was the first Arab country to make peace with the Jewish state , which is of course also a top recipient of US aid .
The Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is more of a voice of moderation against the other side .
Tell us about what he has been saying .
Well , Mr. Mubarak has been , as you say , a voice of moderation .
He has invested an awful amount in the peace with Israel , and really he can not afford to let it fail .
We have seen some more power techniques perhaps from his Foreign Minister Amre Moussa over the last few weeks , but Amre Moussa today at the Foreign Minister 's meeting was calling simply for the return of East Jerusalem to the Palestinians , in stark contrast to Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al - Shara who was pulling for a complete cut in diplomatic relations between Israel and the two Arab states that happen .
So Egypt is playing a calming role .
It will not want to see anything too strong coming out of this summit due to end on Sunday .
What seemed to be the prevailing voices at this point ?
There are certainly calls for war against Israel .
Is there much support for that ?
Well , actually President Mubarak was very categorical today in condemning calls for war , which he said were very serious and people should understand the implications of just what it meant .
Egypt and Jordan do not want to see any sort of conventional war against Israel .
They have both invested enormous amounts in it , and both regimes would be more vulnerable if the peace process were to fail , because detractors and opponents within each country would have ammunition by which to fire at them .
How much is the United States entering into the conversation and how much pressure seems to be coming from the United States ?
Well today not too much .
I mean Madeleine Albright was in Saudi Arabia yesterday where she met with crown prince Abdullah and the new Syrian President Bashar Al - Assad .
Interestingly enough she is quoted as telling General Sanholi back to the US that she did not really get too much of a reception from Bashar Al - Assad in terms of lightening the traditionally antagonistic Syrian align towards Israel .
Nonetheless , the fact that she did meet with Bashar Al - Assad and it was n't Saudi Arabia which is traditionally being more dovish and has supported US policy , it is significant .
So , as of today , I would say certainly on the surface there has been little US action .
Well , thank you very much for the update .
James Drummond , correspondent for the Financial Times of London speaking to us from Cairo .

Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein has given a defiant speech to mark the tenth anniversary of the Gulf War .
He says Iraq has triumphed over the evil of the West .
Barbara Plett reports from Baghdad .
Saddam Hussein addressed the nation in a speech filled with rhetoric and a declaration of victory .
`` Iraq has triumphed over its enemies , '' he said , `` and it will triumph in the remaining rounds of the battle . ''
The Iraqi leader said the Gulf War was a confrontation between good and evil that continues to this day .
He was referring to his struggle against the US , which strongly supports the economic embargo meant to force him to disarm .
After the speech demonstrators gathered in a public show of support for their President .
A sense of nationalism has grown stronger here as many people rally against what they say is a siege on their country .

I wish I could tell you which site this flag was hoisted in .
We have the pictures coming in from Central Florida , News 13 .
This is that City Hall in Orlando , now I 'm being told .
Quite an emotional scene this morning .
David Williams , one of the POWs whose face we got to know in the coverage that we saw coming from Iraq .
Other POWs from Iraq after they were captured and released , that dramatic release that Sunday morning when they were picked up by a squadron of Marines who had wandered in a town in Baghdad and were told where they were being kept .
Dramatic rescue and then a return home .
Quite an emotional experience and one of us can only imagine what it must have been like to endure .
As we said , quite an emotional moment in Orlando , Florida .
And you see Apache helicopter pilot and his wife Michelle who was talking with us on the telephone the Sunday morning when the video came in of the rescue of the POWs and , she identified her husband and life just got better and better for her after that .
Moving on now , in upstate New York Stock Exchange criminal charges have been filed in last month 's fraternity hazing death at Platsberg State University of New York .
11 members had been charged with negligent homicide for forcing 18 - year - old pledge Walter Dean Jenning to drink an excessive amount of water .
The fraternity also faces more than 150 charges for other hazing activities , as well .
Moving on to the Laci Peterson case Bill , an unusual request from Scott Peterson 's attorney .
A pair of Laci Peterson 's missing shoes could be very important evidence in Scott 's murder trial .
She is asking anyone who finds the pair to give them back .
No sign of Geragos or Peterson in court yesterday when a judge was considering whether to unseal warrants obtained before Scott Peterson 's arrest .
Peterson awaiting trial in the murder of his wife Laci and their unborn son .
Joining us , Beth Caras .
Good morning once again .
Thanks for being with us .
Well , joining us now , the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission , William Donaldson .
MR. chairman , it 's good to have you here .
Nice to be here , Lou .
Let 's start with that surprise , the malfeasance that is crossing your desk .
Are you suggesting corporate America has not learned its lesson yet ?
Well , no .
I think that quote is a little out of context there .
there are 15,000 companies in the United States , and I think the great bulk of them are very honestly managed and so forth .
a number of people have had egregious fraud and so forth .
There 's been a general loosening of morals across the board .
What I was referring to in that quote you had was the number of cases we see day in and day out at the lowest levels , scams and so forth , where considerable amounts of money are being made and lost by relatively small investors .
Is the investor today in your judgment secure ?
Well , I think that the marketplace is becoming increasingly secure .
I think a number of the reforms that have come via the Sarbanes - Oxley Act and a number of things that we have done at the SEC are basically making everybody take a new look at how they 're performing their duty as a director , how they 're performing their duties on audit committees and compensation committees and in Wall Street .
I think the reforms that came as a part of the large settlement are going to change the way research and investment banking are done to the betterment of the individual investor .
And some people are surprised and I might even add pleased in this city that your SEC has been quick to react when Phil Purcell of Morgan Stanley made a statement that your SEC did n't think and that you did n't think expressed appropriate contrition when Bear Stearns stepped out of line in the view of the SEC .
It was n't a polite phone call quietly made , either from your enforcement division or from your office , it was rather public .
Is that the way you 're going to operate ?
Well , Lou , we 're deadly serious about bringing reform into the marketplace .
We 're deadly serious about some of the actions we 've taken , and when we see people who do n't appear to be taking it too seriously , we 're going to get to them right away .
And I think perhaps no one more surprised than some of the people running those firms on Wall Street .
You have also expressed concern about excessive executive compensation , particularly CEO compensation .
Is there really anything that can be done about this problem ?
I think so , Lou .
I think the real next step here is for compensation committees to spend a little more time than they do on what they 're really compensating for .
I think there 's been too much emphasis on performance defined strictly by stock performance and earnings per share .
I think there are a number of other measures that indicate how well somebody 's doing running a company , and I think corporation boards need to spend more time on that dimension .
And with you as Chairman of the SEC exercising your bully pulpit , one assumes that --
Welcome back .
We 're standing by for the White House press briefing .
Ari Fleischer expected to come into the West Wing briefing room to brief reporters on a wide variety of subjects .
We 're all getting , this news in from the speech that the Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge is expected to be delivering at the international press club around 1:00 Eastern at the top of the hour .
We 're expecting that the Homeland Security Secretary will announce , that this Iraqi lawyer , who provided the information to U.S. military authority IES has been granted asylum here in the United States , together with his wife and daughter .
They 're currently in the Washington , D.C. area .
An official tells our justice producer Terry Frieden .
So that development important .
Might get more information from Secretary Tom Ridge when he delivers that speech over at the press club in the next hour .
We 'll be monitoring that as well .
We also have an update on that disturbing development outside Baghdad , about 40 miles or so outside Baghdad in Fallujah where there was a shootout between U.S. troops and Iraqis who had been demonstrating there .
Karl Penhaul is joining us live on the phone with more .
First of all , Karl , how many Iraqis were killed in that incident ?
Now back to `` people in the news . ''
Good to be -LRB- bleep -RRB- King .
Reporter :
With the success of a new television show and last year 's Oz-fest tour ready to kick off , things were looking great for Ozzy Osbourne .
He was sober , he was rich and surrounded by a family who loved him but once again , Ozzy 's high would hit a low .
That July , Sharon Osbourne , Ozzy 's long - time manager , wife and best friend , announced to the world that she 'd been diagnosed with colon cancer .
Every fiber of Ozzy was shaken .
He had to be sedated for a while .
Reporter :
Sharon would have to undergo rounds of chemotherapy all summer .
Ozzy took time off from Oz-fest to tend to his wife .
Ever the rock , Sharon faced cancer head on .
When you go in there and people so much worse than me , and it 's like , How lucky am I to have a great support system .
Reporter :
Even with Sharon trying to make things as easy as possible on her husband , he was still a mess .
His struggle with sobriety would be tested again .
Ozzy 's not doing too good right now .
Drinking ?
Drinking and he 's very delicate .
He 's , like , dealing with it the best he can .
Reporter :
Despite Sharon 's illness , it 's business as usual for the family .
Though pushed back , filming commenced last fall on a second season of `` the Osbournes . ''
Some days when I 'm feeling bad , I say I ca n't do this anymore , and then you wake up and see the crew , and then , you know , you snap out of it .
Reporter :
The larger question loomed .
How could comedy come out of chemotherapy treatments ?
Sharon is dealing with the diagnosis and illness but what 's interesting is humor is the same .
Reporter :
And the humor did remain the same .
The show came back with a vengeance last fall chronicling Ozzy and Sharon dealing with cancer and the kids coping with new - found celebrity and one of the top rated shows .
Ratings for the second season slid .
I 'm not banking my whole life on bringing , you know , number one rated show .
Having a nervous breakdown .
The bubble will burst .
Reporter :
This year , more ups and downs .
Sharon announced in April that the cancer was in remission , but just weeks after that announcement , son Jack entered drug and alcohol rehabilitation in California .
His family said that his party life style caught up with him .
Now , with a third season set to start , will Ozzy 's role as a family man change the image in the annuls of heavy metal mad man ?
I think Ozzy 's the guy that hit a head of a bat , you know ?
Crazy , drug taking , hard drinking , hard living rock n roller .
I think what the show does is also show that you might be those things , but also might be a pretty great dad , too .
I would n't be here now if it was n't for my wife .
I always loved my wife but sometimes I do n't like her and sometimes she does n't like me but we love each other .
I hate these people that go , we 've been married for 56 years and never had a bad word .
They must have been living in a different planet .
Reporter :
Ozzy Osbourne 's life filled with incredible highs crashing into devastating lows .
A manic life , grounded in family values .
Ozzy 's not going to like me saying this , but he 's a very tender , gentle man .
This is a guy whose world revolves not so much around music as around his wife .
Rock `n roll !
Part of the legacy of Ozzy Osbourne is a cautionary tale .
It 's also , you know , tale that includes family love , you know , and a lot of good things .
We have had it .
Reporter :
It 's a tale that continues to unfold .
No telling how long the Osbourne phenomenon may last but the family 's loyal following will always be screaming for more .
Stop screaming !
Reporter :
And so will Ozzy .
Sharon !
Despite problems --
Moving ahead now to a developing story , the hunt for so - called smoking gun , meant to prove that Iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction .
Here 's national security correspondent David Ensor .
Reporter :
While U.S. forces still have n't found any weapons of mass destruction , the new CIA Pentagon report says officials are now confident the mysterious trucks filled with high - tech equipment found in Iraq are indeed mobile biological weapons production facilities , just as Secretary of State Powell predicted and presented the United Nations before the war .
It 's very important to recognize that programs that we had said existed do exist .
Reporter :
Though no trace of biological toxin was found in the trucks , U.S. intelligence officials say they have largely eliminated any other possible use for the fermenters and other equipment .
Not everyone is convinced .
They could very well be biological weapons production facilities , but I do n't think the intelligence community has made an open and shut case .
Reporter :
The CIA - Pentagon reports admits the trucks were not an efficient way to produce biological weapons , but officials argue the point for the Iraqis was to produce some and not to be caught doing it .
This was clearly a very inefficient way to produce anthrax , and the question is why did they invest such resources in a mobile --
`` Vanity Fair 's '' columnist Daniel Fair is here .
Quiting in the June edition , he describes the journey .
He said he found evidence that Hussein 's day of reckoning well overdue .
Christopher Hitchens joins us from California .
Good to have you with us .
Thanks for having me .
Your journey , particularly to southern Iraq , what is evoked there a sense of both that you evoke is a sense of history of this regime .
Give us your insights as to what you think the future holds .
Do you mean if I start with the Past ?
Not at you will .
Not at all .
Not much of a trip .
I was n't up the sharp end .
I was n't taking risks .
I was n't in a position that my dear friend was in when he was killed outside Bagdad airport but I had long thought and I was in Iraq in the previous war that really all the talk that had been about the rush to war , the push for war , the drive for war , all that propaganda , was essentially nonsensical because in 1990 , Saddam Hussein made the only self criticism .
He said , I could either invade Kuwait or finish developing the nuclear weapon .
Maybe before the weapon and then later he said , Oh , I should have got the nuclear weapon before I invaded .
He was right about that , but that means that he inaugurated at that point like a dozen - years war where the United States could be criticized for doing too little and acting too slowly but all we 're arguing about lately is to do with those that should have been finished in `91 when it could have been finished .
Should have taken the side of the rebels then , taken the risk of supporting a Shiite insurrection at that point , helping the Kurds , removing the regime .
Absolutely .
We 'd be 11 years into nation building by now if we 'd done that .
That seems to be the core of the argument .
As you point out , of course , for the fact of the matter is , the mistakes of Saddam Hussein made possible his removal from power ultimately .
The mistakes of the United States , again , as you point out , Norman Schwarzkopf making a peace , permitting helicopters to fly .
Still hurts me to read this .
The little town I was in this southern Iraq , as far as I got , I ca n't boast of further , is where the talks took place .
We have the transcript of the meeting .
They say , Okay , we have lost this round , Do you mind if we keep your helicopters in the air just to be able to transport things ? and he says , Yeah , that 's all right .
They ask again , Are you sure they mean that ?
They ca n't believe the luck .
They use the gunships to kill , we think , not less than 50,000 inhabitants of southern Iraq and trying to do that to the Kurds , as well , so it was a knife edge .
And it 's not just being wise after the event , I believe , to say that there was an argument in realtime between the Bush administration members .
Mr. Cheney 's the only one I know that changed his mind .
Most of those that took the view at that time , think until recently they were correct in saving Saddam Hussein .
Of course , Mr. Cheney was in the chain of command with Swartzkopf and --
Many others .
When they made the decision not to move toward Bagdad with bad information , namely , the Republican Guard absolutely devastated .
Yes .
And , well , we know now the harvest of all that .
It hurts to think of how many wonderful people in Iraq at the academic community , lawyers , human rights activists , civilians , intellectuals , people -- would now be alive , who have been horribly murdered and tortured and reduced to misery since by a half application of violence through sanctions and overflights .
Mistakes made then , mistakes part of human experience , but now we have an opportunity not to make mistakes .
Is it your sense that the United States is on the right track ? that there is a commitment here on the part of the United States to --

We talked with the lieutenant in Miami and there is big time concern in the Shenandoah neighborhood , southwestern portion of Miami .
Overseas in Iraq , a major operation underway .
Some U.S. troops have not had a chance to call home since they were deployed for duty in `` Operation Iraqi Freedom . ''
For some wives , the kindness of strangers has eased their worries .
Beth Basin explains .
Reporter :
Jamie 's husband Jack was deployed a couple of weeks ago .
She and her daughter Jordan often shuffle through these pictures of him taken before he left .
She has no idea where her husband is now , but thanks to a little help from a Delta flight attendant , she knew he got where he was going .
She had taken a picture of him and everything .
Reporter :
Along with the picture , the flight attendant wrote a letter saying she was praying for Jack 's safe return .
The trip to Georgia was just the first leg .
He got on a flight to an undisclosed location , when Jamie got a second phone call from a flight attendant .
He asked us to call you to let you know he 's okay .
And she told us that he whipped out pictures of our kids and everything and showed all the family pictures and stuff .
Reporter :
Jamie is not the only military wife who received a photo and letter .
Her friend Anna also got one .
Turns out Anna 's husband flew out on the same flight as Jack .
Although a small gesture , Anna says it 's meant a great deal .
It made me realize that someone out there does care about my husband and the rest of the military , and it 's not all anti-war .
Reporter :
Even though neither of the women have ever met the flight attendants , they say they 'll never forget their act of kindness .

As we said , earlier this week , Christine Todd Whitman stepped down and now a whole lot of analysis is taking place as to why she stepped down , the job she 's done when she was in office and the job that has yet to be complete .
From our New York bureau as I was introducing a moment ago , Dan Fagen , the environment writer for News Day .
and Dan , Whitman did consider herself sort of the Republican environmentalist , but now there 's been an awful lot of Monday night quarterback quarterbacking taking place now that she 's stepped down .
What do you suppose took place here ?
I think many people have watched this administration in action and watched Christy Whitman in action .
The mystery is that she took the job in the first place or did n't leave earlier .
She was quite a misfit for this administration , and she showed that over and over .
She was not good at all at communicating the administration 's message to the public and certainly to the environmental groups and she was even worse at bringing the EPA bureaucracy , the EPA environmental policy makers ' message to this administration because she saw herself undercut over and over .
That 's interesting because leading into it , while she was New Jersey governor , she sued the EPA and she was very much considering herself to be an environmentalist , and then only to end up becoming the head of the EPA and then of course , there was a lot of criticism over relaxed regulations .
Let 's hear what she had to say last Wednesday here on CNN just after announcing her resignation .
I 'm not leaving because of clashes with the administration , in fact , I have n't had any .
I report to the President , and he has always asked me to give him my best unadulterated advice .
We have have been on the same page .
I was never supportive of protocol because it did n't do what everyone needs to get done as far as climate change is concerned .
I 'm leaving now because it 's the appropriate time to do it .
Dan , do you agree with that ?
She says the appropriate time .
Do you suppose for personal reasons or perhaps she was out of step with the administration ?
I 'm sure that it was difficult for her personally , but I think the commuter marriage perhaps would have been less stressful if everyday she did n't see herself being undermined and overruled .
I mean if Christy Whitman and the White House were on the same page , I do n't think I 've seen a book large enough to contain a page that big .
Over and over there were many , many instances over the last --
An occasion that marked the formal establishment between our two countries .
Since then this relationship has grown in importance to us both through good times and bad .
Both of my generation and Britain have special pause to remember the unacceptable sacrifice the Russian people made to defeat fascism in the Second World War .
Nothing , not even the fact that our countries became estranged in the war 's aftermath , has ever dimmed our memory of the scale of your loss .
That experience should continue to inspire us , as we seek to build a more peaceful and secure world .
When I visited your country in 1994 , I recall saying to President Yeltsin that he and I spent most of our lives believing such a visit would never happen , and that I hoped he was as delighted as I was to be proved wrong .
I 'm just as delighted now , nine years later , to be able to welcome you here and to learn about the great changes which have occurred in your country since I was there .
Russia has established itself as our partner and our friend .
We work together bilatarily and on the international stage , and we are developing new links all the time in fields of commerce , culture , counterterrorism , energy , education environment .
I know you will be seeing evidence of some of this during your visit .
Mr. President , it is , I believe , a sign of genuine friendship that we are able to have disagreements , but remain firm partners .
It is no secret that the significant differences between our two countries earlier this year on how best to handle Iraq , but we are now able to look forward together firmly in agreement on the route we have decided in the United Nations , although , the tragic loss of British lives today reminds us all of the difficulties to be faced .
But as we look ahead , we know that our long - term partnership is of profound importance to both of us .
This is clearly evident , if we look beyond the challenges of international politics .
In the last few months alone , we have heard the announcements of major investments in Russia by British companies .
We have also heard a different sign of Sir Paul McCartney playing to enthusiastic crowds in Red Square , and we , in turn , have been enthralled by the celebrations of your own city in Petersburg .
At the same time , work continues to bring the young people of our countries closer together through language , teaching , school exchanges and university programs .
We have a vibrant and exciting relationship from which we both derive mass benefit .
Mr. President , your country is rich --
Convicted rapist and Max Factor heir Andrew Luster is back in California .

Canada is on the path to becoming the third country to allow gay marriage .
The federal government will not appeal the court ruling that cleared the way for same - sex unions .
Prime Minister Jean Chretien says the government will now draft legislation legalizing gay marriages .
And the U.S. government , can withhold the names of people detained as part of the 9 / 11 investigation .
That 's the decision from a federal appeals court reversing a lower court ruling .
The Justice Department argued that releasing the names could hamper ongoing investigations .
As we 've been reporting , only within the past hour or so , there 's been a shooting incident in central Israel , not far from the West Bank .

Welcome and good evening , everyone .
Mike is off tonight .
To our top story of the evening -- Martha Stewart is stepping down as head of her media empire .
She announced her decision to vacate her post as chief executive of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia , following word of a federal indictment .
In a statement , she says she 's stepping aside in the best interest of the company , but she will stay on the board of directors .
Stewart pleaded not guilty to a nine - count indictment .
The charges include conspiracy to obstruct justice and perjury connected to an insider trading scandal .
The government also filed civil charges against her .
She is charged with using insider information to bail out of a biotech stock the day before its price tanked , and then trying to cover it up .
Her stockbroker was also charged .
If convicted on all counts , Stewart faces up to 30 years in prison and $ 2 million in fines .
And the Dixie Chicks open their U.S. tour tomorrow night in Greenville , South Carolina .
The popular band has been criticized within country music circles for comments by lead singer Natalie Maines .
She said she was embarrassed to be from the same state as President Bush .
She has since apologized for her remarks .
Hmm , those Dixie Chicks .
Speaking of chicks -- call it puppy love , call it maternal instinct , but , mostly it 's just out of the ordinary .
Andrea Ash from Kezi in Portland has this story of chicken that decided to take a new day job .
Reporter :
People have long struggled with the question , Why did the chicken cross the road ? - but all the Scott family wants to know is , Why did a chicken adopt their ten new puppies ?
Every time we looked out our window it was like , What is she doing in there ?
It looks so out of place .
It 's just funny .
Reporter :
The puppies were born Easter Sunday .
Soon after , one of the family 's three chickens flew the coop and took up residence in the crate built especially for the puppies .
They goes in there and nuzzles with the puppies , or lays her eggs and sits there with the mother .
They 're just all happy , a little family in there .
Reporter :
At first the sight shocked the Scott family .
They tried to shoo the hen away but she kept coming back , even putting up baby gates to try to keep the chicken out .
No match for her .
She simply flew over .
It also got past the puppies ' protective father .
I am going to sit with these punies .
Reporter :
The Scotts ran it past their vet and the vet assured them , as long as the hen left her crate to do business , she was no harm to the pup .
The family says the chicken keeps the place clean , so she 's free to stay .
A pretty good relationship with that chicken .
She does n't mind them crawling around underneath her .
Reporter :
When the mom comes in , the puppies know exactly where to go for milk -- sort of a little confusion .
The pups do n't exactly know the difference between fur and feathers yet .
After all , they 're only a week old .
Eventually they all find the real mom .
No one knows what will happen as the pups grow older and are able to open their eyes .
Chances are , they 'll always have a fondness from one hen .
Those puppies are in for a heck of a surprise when they do open their eyes , are n't they ?
The puppies come home to roost !
That 's a good one .
That was a great story .

Another story out of Belgrade , violence at the highest form .
The Serbian Prime Minister , Zoran Djindjic has died of his wounds after being shot , an assassination attempt .
Apparently , he was on his way to greet reporters at the time outside the main government office there in Belgrade .
All this happening about 90 minutes ago based on the wire reports we 're getting here .
The word from Serbia , Zoran Djindjic , the Prime Minister , is dead .
Earlier reports said he was shot in the back , as well as the stomach .
It looks like an annual tradition is building .
80,000 people with a shared love of music converge on a Tennessee pasture for three days of good vibes and who knows what else .
It 's called Bonnaroo .
Check it out .
Bonnaroo is kind of this going example of what the whole jam band community is turned in .
That 's what I really like about the jam community , its acceptance of improvizational music , despite whatever region or genre .
It 's about the freedom of the music and the freedom of expression .
Well , we sold all 80,000 tickets through our web site .
We sold out in 16 days .
I mean , the amazing thing is , we used no traditional advertising .
We put all these bands together .
It draws a huge audience , so the record companies and the music business has to take all of these forms of music more seriously .
It 's like strength in numbers .
I hope this kind of thing can happen in America , instead of it just being these isolated festivals like Bonnaroo , it really can happen in 100 cities every summer , like the festivals do in Europe .
My only complaint is the overlapping .
You know , as a music lover that I am , there 's five acts all playing at the same time on five different stages that I want to see .
It really comes from the actual bands and the fact that there 's this grassroots following that 's been there , you know , for a long time , primarily started by the Grateful Dead , at least the future by the Grateful Dead .
We will get by we will survive .
We 're carrying on a tradition that started a long time .
In American music , improvization is what it 's always been about .
It 's not just clapping and having a good time .
It makes you feel a certain kind of love , and hopefully , that translates in the community .
You go out .
You hug someone .
You do something good .
You make a better world .
For me , that 's music .
We love you .

Central Command has determined that Baghdad Airport is unusable for normal air operations .
The airport , for the most part , is now under U.S. control .
Military officials will not say whether damage to the runways is going to limit operation there , but they know there are underground bunkers there and some other areas that may be of use .
Centcom also says 2500 Republican Guard troops have surrendered to U.S. Marines between Kut and Baghdad .
Military officials say the Baghdad Republican Guard division is no longer an effective fighting force .
USAirways is flying its way out of bankruptcy .
The company which lost nearly $ 4 billion over the past two years has cut its annual costs by nearly $ 2 billion .
Most of that was saved by cutting employee wages and benefits .
The Dow is down , you see there , just about almost 140 points .
Nasdaq down 20 and the S&P is down , as well .
So the markets are continuing their negative trend from last week .

Now let 's go back to Wolf Blitzer in Kuwait City for more special coverage of the war in Iraq .
Breaking news out of Long Beach , a situation with a standoff involving a 2 - year - old and a man with a gun , this one having a peaceful ending .
This is near the Long Beach Airport and involved a city bus .
A man who had assault , he actually had assault with a deadly weapon , this is pictures .
Look at that .
Man spread - eagle with a two - year - old child .
The officer is going to go in and swoop her away .
As we understand it , the man had the child .
It was inside of the city bus .
Police surrounded this bus near the airport with guns drawn .
The man came out and did the spread - eagle like that .
Just as he did that , that 's when you saw the child just walking just a few feet away from him but the officers were able to get the child away .
They handcuffed the man and they took him into custody .
That was after he had actually barricaded himself inside that bus with the child .
So that one coming to a peaceful ending , what could have been a very gruesome situation involving that two - year - old child in Southern California .
That one is over in Long Beach .
A Palestinian terrorist leader wanted for a deadly 1985 cruise ship hijacking is in U.S. custody in Iraq .
U.S. sources tell CNN Mohammed `` Abu '' Abbas was captured about 50 miles west of Baghdad .

Hello from Atlanta .
Our top story this half hour , the man responsible for U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf says there was no specific threat of an imminent attack in the Yemeni port of Aden before a bomb ripped into the `` USS Cole '' there this month .
Army General Tommy Franks , head of the U.S. Central Command , today testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee to answer questions about the attack .
He told lawmakers it would not trigger a U.S. retreat from the Persian Gulf , even though troops remain at risk to terrorism .
17 sailors were killed and dozens were injured when the explosion blew a huge hole into the hull of the Navy destroyer as it was refueling in Aden .
Franks said U.S. war ships have made almost 30 safe visits to Aden since January of last year .
He added the attack is already the subject of an intense investigation by many agencies .
We 're determined to get to the bottom of this .
We 'll put the events that led up to `` Cole '' under a microscope , and , in fact , we 've begun that process .
We will find the facts we need to find , and we 'll use the lessons that we learn from `` Cole '' to provide the best possible force protection for our troops in one of the most dangerous regions of the world .

Cool .
That 's awesome .

As much as I 'd love to spend every day after school sucking up to teachers instead of hanging with my friends , I do n't want this job .
The series is created by nationally syndicated cartoonist and author John Callahan , who is a quadriplegic .
We just felt he understands how to reach people and how to reach kids .
I think kids lead the way .
Kids lead the way in diversity , because they 're very accepting of other kids in terms of who they are , and who they really are as people .
We 're normal people , and that 's what Pelswick was , he was just a normal kid .
Fox TV 's `` Malcolm in the Middle '' also features a young boy who uses a wheelchair .

I 'm so working here .
My dream is to become a playwright , an actress .
I would love to be a diva .
And those dreams were a little closer to coming true this day , and with shows like `` Pelswick , '' they say -- well , when they get a little older , maybe people wo n't even look down first .
I 'm not down here .
I 'm up here .

Armed conflict in the Balkans puts an international spotlight on a Serb leader .
Bob Glascoff looks at Slobodan Milosevic 's rise to power , and his recent political setback , in today 's edition of `` Headliners . ''
In December of 1990 , Slobodan Milosevic is elected President in Serbia 's first free elections in 50 years .
Milosevic headed Yugoslavia 's state - run gas company and was President of a major Belgrade bank climbing the political ladder as a Communist technocrat .
He used his rising popularity amongst the Serb people to oust former mentor Ivan Stambolic and take over as President of the Serbian republic .
His brutal efforts to create a Serb - dominated Yugoslavia earned him the nickname `` Butcher of the Balkans . ''
Many speculated that Milosevic , whose parents and uncle committed suicide , might be mentally unbalanced himself .
Constitutionally barred from serving a third term as Serbian President , he clung to power by having the federal parliament elect him President of Yugoslavia .
Milosevic was defeated by opposition leader Vojislave Kostunica in presidential elections this year , but refused to accept the results .
Faced with massive demonstrations and Russia 's backing of Kostunica , he agreed to step down in October .
With `` Headliners , '' I 'm Bob Glascoff .
In view of the important characteristics of warfare in a modern information rich environment , a training base in the Lanzhou Military Command has taken care to create a complex electromagnetic environment when organizing army exercises , in order to improve through training the military 's ability to win battles in an information - rich environment .
During one recently organized exercise , to create the electromagnetic environment for the blue force 's command and communication system , they used the method which combines real and simulated set - up , aerial and land - based , fixed and tracking , and real and fake measures .
Using advanced electronic information technology and simulation technology , they produced things like mimic radar communication vehicles and mimic satellites communication vehicles that simulate electromagnetic properties .
They placed actual objects inside the blue force 's positions to mimic the electromagnetic environment that various kinds of weaponry would create during a battle .
Through the combined operation of many techniques , they chiefly worked to create a relatively complex electromagnetic battlefield for the army .
Against a complex electromagnetic environment and countermeasures , they guided the army to carry out exercises in electronic reconnaissance and anti-reconnaissance , jamming and anti-jamming , suppression and anti-suppression actions and other operations .
This effectively trained and improved the army 's ability to carry out multiple combat operations in an information - rich environment .

According to a BBC report on the nineteenth , a study group composed of American and Russian scientists recently discovered several kinds of microbes composed of special substances .
Following their research , the scientists made a bold supposition : that some of the earliest simple life forms on Earth were very likely attached to meteorites from Mars that came to Earth .
In their research , the American and Russian scientists discovered that these special microbes can live even after being exposed to radiation thousands of times greater than the radiation the human body can withstand .
Because of this , they think that these special and rare microbes have already gained some kind of ability to resist powerful radiation while maintaining moisture .
The scientists do not believe that any life forms originated on Earth would be able to develop these special capabilities .
Because there is evidence indicating that there have not been large fluctuations in radiation levels on Earth during the past four billion years , they think that these super-microbes could have originated from Mars and come to Earth as they hitched a ride on meteorites , and ultimately become the earliest simple life forms on Earth .
The results of their research will be published in the latest edition of the journal Astrobiology .
However , many other scientists have nevertheless expressed doubts on this .
Some scholars have pointed out that the DNA of these super-microbes does not differ in many ways from regular microbes .
Other scientists have also pointed out that of the tens of thousands of meteorites already found on Earth , only twenty or so came from Mars .
Even if these super-microbes had existed on Mars , the possibility that they hitched a ride to Earth on meteorites is not very great either .

Well , John , there has been reaction from the Bush team .
You know , this decision by the Gore campaign , a refusal to concede even if they do not prevail in the manual recounts under way certainly carries some political risk , but the Gore team tonight defends the decision , saying that fellow Democrats and the public would not only accept but demand what they call a fair and accurate recount in all the relevant counties .

John ?
NBC 's David Gregory in Austin .
David , thank you .
Up next , from recounts to --
As we heard from David Gregory , one of Governor Bush 's main themes in these last days of the campaign is getting rid of partisan gridlock in Washington , which was exactly what the President was talking about today -- an attempt to reopen debate on a $ 240 billion tax cut plan , saying the version House Republicans passed is unacceptable , because it is unfair , according to the President , to children and seniors .
Instead of meeting us on common ground , instead of working with the White House or congressional Democrats , the Republican leadership closed its doors to compromise -- literally closed the doors to compromise .
They crafted their own partisan tax package and passed it last night on a party - line vote .
Republican leaders for their part said reopening the tax debate is not now realistic and the tax cut bill is probably tombed .
They are angry that the President is threatening to veto it saying it 's wrong to have political budget battles right before the election .
And one of the longest running struggles for international justice reached a milestone today of sorts , when a Scottish court , meeting in the Netherlands , finally officially found someone guilty in the 1988 bombing that brought down Pan Am Flight 103 .
He 's a Libyan intelligence agent and as NBC 's Jim Maceda reports tonight from the court , many of the families of the victims think the verdict did n't go far enough .
Today was D - Day in the murder trial which in the end brought some relief .
For grieving families , only a partial victory .
After 12 years of waiting and a nine - month trial , family members of some of the victims of Pan Am Flight 103 come to this special Scottish courthouse in the Netherlands one last time to hear the verdict against two Libyan defendants charged with murder .
A split decision for Lamen Khalifa Fhimah , aquittal , but Abdel Basset Ali Al - megrahi found guilty as charged .
The court ruled this senior Libyan intelligence agent planted the bomb that killed 270 , mostly Americans , when the plane bound for New York exploded over Lockerbie , Scotland .
Inside the courtroom today , the elation overwhelming .
A good many of the relatives gasped .
There was a big intake of breath .
Jim Swire , whose daughter died in the 1988 crash , collapses .
He later recovered , blaming stress .
But Al - megrahi 's sentence , 20 years in jail , too light for Brian Flynn .
His brother was on Flight 103 .
It was n't one murder it was 270 people he murdered .
Frustration too that Moammar Khaddafi was immune from prosecution , one of the ground rules here .
You get the operatives .
You do n't always get the higherups .
Reaction in Libya , where many followed the trial , mixed .
Some anger in the streets , but government officials downplaying the conviction , calling for an end to international sanctions .
Not yet , says President George W. Bush , at the White House today , demanding that Khaddafi meet certain conditions first , to accept responsibility for this act , and to compensate the families .
But even that would fall short for those who have lost loved ones .
Tonight , some of those families made it clear their battle is not over to get to the truth and however difficult , punish the real authors of this crime .
Tom ?
Thanks very much , NBC 's Jim Maceda tonight for the trial of the Lockerbie 103 Pan Am crash .
