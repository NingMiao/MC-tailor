The United States has lifted some of the economic sanctions it imposed on Yugoslavia two years ago .
As VOA 's Eve Cornet reports from Belgrade , a US special envoy gave the news to President Vojislav Kostunica .
Balkans advisor James O'Brien and President Kostunica met for the first top - level talks between the United States and Yugoslavia , since the break of diplomatic relations on the eve of Nato air strikes in 1999 .
President Kostunica said he was ready for dialogue with the West , but stressed that territorial accords reached with international negotiators in the Balkans should be respected .
Balkans envoy O'Brian stressed that the US would begin lifting sanctions against Yugoslavia and that only technical issues remain an obstacle to reestablishing relations .
However , key sanctions which directly target ousted Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic and his allies remain in place .
Meanwhile , parties in Slobodan Milosevic 's socialist coalition are making it clear they plan to hold onto control of the Serbian government , despite calls for new elections .
Eve Cornet , VOA News , Belgrade .
The Balkan Stability Pact has admitted Yugoslavia as a full member marking Belgrade 's return to the international community after years of isolation under ousted President Slobodan Milosevic .

In the latest daily CNN USA Today Gallup popular opinion survey , George W Bush , the Governor of Texas , the Republican nominee , holds a 49 % to 42 % advantage over his Democratic opponent Al Gore , the Vice President , but two other major surveys gave Mr. Bush only a one - point lead .
On Sunday , several major newspapers weighed in with their endorsements and VOA 's Peter Hymline has that story .
In its Sunday editions , the New York Times calls Vice President Gore , the man best equipped for the presidency by virtue of his knowledge of government , his experience at the top levels of federal and diplomatic decision making and his devotion to the general welfare .
The Times editorial says Mr. Gore has , in its words , struggled impressively and successfully to escape the shadow of the Clinton administration 's ethical lapses .
The paper 's editorial board goes on to say , we believe Mr. Gore would never follow Bill Clinton 's example of reckless conduct that cheapens the Presidency .
The Times also praise Republican candidate George W Bush for running what was described as a largely positive inclusive campaign but the writers said they had concluded Mr. Bush 's agenda was harsh on issues such as women 's rights , guns , and law enforcement .
The Times joins the Washington Post newspaper , which earlier gave its backing to Mr. Gore .
Other major dailies throwing their support to the Vice President Sunday included The Philadelphia Inquirer , The Denver Post and The San Jose California Mercury News .
Mr. Bush also picked up some key endorsements Sunday including both major Chicago papers .
In its editorial , The Chicago Tribune called Mr. Gore a decent man but concluded that , in its words , his penchant for enhancement has become something of a running joke .
The Tribune endorsement says this is an election about honesty , about restoring bipartisanship , about fostering government that will nurture a booming economy without getting in the way of American ingenuity .
The paper concludes that there is one candidate who will do that and that is George W Bush .
The battle of the editorials reflects what many political analysts predict will be one of the closest Presidential races in decades .
Most opinion polls give Mr. Bush a slight lead but a just released survey by Newsweek magazine puts the text .
The Newsweek poll indicates voters consider Vice President Gore the more intelligent candidate , but they see Governor Bush as more honest .

A Venezuelan Ford executive says Firestone hid information about tyre defects from Ford and should be held responsible for more than one hundred traffic accidents in the South American country .
Hector Rodriguez told the hearing of the Venezuelan Consumer Protection Agency that Bridgeton Firestone knew about the tyre defects for many months and should be held responsible for the accidents .
In a letter to the consumer panel a spokesman for Firestone said the company 's appearance at Wednesday 's hearing would have implied fault , which it denies .
The Venezuelan government panel wants both Ford and Firestone to compensate victims of accidents caused by Ford vehicles equipped with Firestone tyres .
Some 46 people have died on Venezuelan highways in accidents caused by the vehicles .
Meanwhile , in Philadelphia the Phillies have hired Larry Bowa as their new manager for the 2001 season .
The fiery Bowa helped lead the Phillies to the franchise 's only World Series Championship in 1980 , as a player .

He replaces Terry Francona who was fired on October the 1st .
A leading expert on international finance , Johns Hopkins University economist , Steve Hanky says Yugoslavia 's new President Vojislav Kostunica only has a few weeks to reassure financial stability in the dominant republic of Serbia by stabilizing the inflation - prone Yugoslav dinar .
VOA 's Barry Wood spoke with Mr. Hanky , who recently returned from several weeks in Europe .
Mr. Hanky says that President Kostunica has only two options for achieving financial stability in Serbia .
He can either abandon the dinar and adopt the German mark as the Yugoslav Republic of Montenegro has done or , Mr. Hanky says , Serbia can adopt a currency board system under which a new currency would be issued under conditions of utmost financial discipline .
I think if Kostunica does not move in a direction decisively within the next month of abandoning the dinar completely or going to a deutsche mark based currency board where we have a foreign governor on the board , the chances for economic unification in the area and economic recovery in Serbia are slim at best .
Mr. Hanky says it 's essential that President Kostunica embrace the principle of sound money , something Mr. Hanky believes is as important as the rule of law .
Last week , the new acting head of the Yugoslav Central Bank devalued the dinar , bringing it to 30 to the dollar , compared to the previous official rate of 20 .
Mr. Hanky , who regards the dinar as the world 's worst currency , says the deutsch mark is becoming the de facto money in the entire Balkan region .
If they use the d mark in Serbia , obviously there would be essentially the same system that they have in Montenegro and if they had a currency board with a foreign national running the thing , like Bosnia , it would essentially mean that they had a unified system was what they have in Montenegro because with Montenegro , they would still have the d mark as legal tender , but they would also use this new currency board money from Serbia and there would be absolutely no problem , and furthermore , from a regional point of view , you 'd have essentially most of the Balkans in a unified currency zone because Bulgaria has a currency board that 's d mark based .
Bosnia has a currency board that 's d mark based .
Kosovo has a d mark , Montenegro has a d mark .
Mr. Hanky was instrumental in developing the deutsche mark based currency systems throughout the region .
Advisors to Mr. Kostunica say they are considering a currency board system for Serbia .

Mr. Clinton spoke at the end of his third official trip to Northern Ireland after holding talks with the province 's leaders .
Meanwhile , 200 people from North and South Korea are taking part in the second round of family reunions .
The story from VOA 's Alicia Reu .
As in August , communist North Korea is allowing 100 relatives to travel to South Korea 's capital Seoul to visit loved ones they have not seen for five decades .
One hundred South Koreans will be in the northern capital Pyongyang , to meet their North Korean relatives , but South Korean officials say media interest for the upcoming event has dropped substantially .
The government has also cut back on cost and allotted days for the reunions .
Officials say they have reduced the reunion schedule from four days to three and will spend some $ 800,000 to bring the families together , compared to the nearly $ 1.6 million it spent for the August event .
Nevertheless , the reunions represent one of the most tangible signs of thawing between the two cold war enemies .
The North and South Korean leaders agreed to the reunions as part of a broader reconciliation policy at an unprecedented summit in June .

Democratic reformers are claiming victory in Saturday 's parliamentary elections in Serbia , the dominant republic of Yugoslavia .
Mr. Kostunica told Serbian television today that the election victory will allow the reformers to move swiftly to start building a democratic government in what he called a socially oriented market economy .
VOA 's Barry Wood reports from Belgrade that the elections come less than three months after Slobodan Milosevic was ousted from power when he lost to a reformer in a presidential election .
Reformist Democratic Opposition of Serbia , the DOS , proclaimed victory only hours after the polls closed .
Unofficial results suggest that the reformist coalition will obtain about 65 % and a clear majority in the 250 seat Serbian Parliament .
The Socialist Party of ousted strong man Slobodan Milosevic , appears to be getting 13 % of the vote and is likely to be the largest single party in the Parliament .
Vote counting continues with official results likely no sooner than late Sunday .
Voter turnout was about 60 % less than had been expected .
Reformist leader Zuan Jinjich , who is said to become Serbia 's Prime Minister , called the election a popular mandate for democracy and the free market economy .
He promises to bring Mr. Milosevic to justice and rid the police and judiciary of Milosevic loyalists .

It 's now official , former star Mario Lemieux is coming out of retirement to play for the National Ice Hockey League team that he owns , the Pittsburgh Penguins .
Lemieux was the first NHL player to become a team owner .
Now , he is the first owner to become a player .
In a news release , Friday , Lemieux said he missed the game and missed the challenge of competing .
He added that he was excited by the challenge of attempting a comeback and looks forward to the chance to get back on the ice with the players .
The 35 - year - old Lemieux retired as a player three and one half years ago with 613 goals in 745 regular season games .
He won three most valuable player awards and led the Penguins to two Stanley Cup championships in 1991 and 92 .
Former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic won a landslide victory Saturday as he was re-elected leader of the Socialist Party of Serbia .
A defiant Mr. Milosevic made his first public appearance since being deposed in a popular uprising last month .
He told the SPS conference in Belgrade , those who sought his downfall are traitors and agents of Western countries .
President Clinton has telephoned Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in a bid to restart Israeli - Palestinian peace negotiations .
An Arafat advisor told reporters the two leaders agreed to work together to try to reach an agreement .
The United States is exploring the possibility of hosting new peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians in Washington as early as next week .
The United States responded cautiously Monday to a declaration by Iraq that it would resume oil exports to fulfill existing contracts .
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said there is no confirmation as yet that Iraq has in fact begun allowing the loading of oil tankers .
The UN overseers report that Iraq is not allowing loadings into tankers .
We reiterate Iraq is the one who has chosen to suspend oil exports , even though , the Security Council agreed to allow shipments to continue while the UN and Iraq concluded a pricing mechanism to reflect a fair market value for December exports , and once again we make quite clear we continue our work with other governments and with the International Energy Agency , and we are ready to take action to add supply very quickly as this situation should warm up .
On Sunday Iraq backed away from an oil export halt that it had called two days earlier .
Prime Minister Ehud Barak defends Israel 's bombardment of Palestinian targets in the Gaza Strip in response to a bomb attack on a school bus in Gaza that killed two Jewish settlers and injured at least nine , some of them children .
VOA correspondent Eve Connan in Jerusalem reports .
Dozens of people are reported injured in the air raids which Palestinian leaders are calling an act of criminal aggression .
As night fell , Israeli combat helicopters fired dozens of missiles at targets in the Gaza Strip , striking near the office of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat .
Targets included a police station and security headquarters .
Parts of Gaza were plunged into darkness as electricity went off during the raids .
Following the strikes , Prime Minister Ehud Barak warned Israel would use all force necessary with no restraints to end weeks of violence .
He described the bombing of a school bus traveling from a Jewish settlement in the Gaza Strip early Monday , as a barbaric and terrorist act , and said no negotiations were currently underway with the Palestinian leadership .
Earlier , the Palestinian authority issued a statement denying involvement in the school bus attack .
Palestinian leaders accused Israel of choosing a path of war by launching the strikes and called for international intervention .

President Clinton will host a meeting at the White house Saturday with Israeli and Palestinian negotiators who are holding talks in Washington .
Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben - Ami and lead Palestinian negotiator Sayeeb Erekat are coming to report to the President and to meet with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright .
On Friday Ms. Albright joined the two negotiators at the peace talks at Bowling Airbase in Washington .
The talks are aimed at putting the peace process back on track after three months of violence .
Mark Rengav , a spokesman for the Israeli embassy in Washington told VOA , the security of the Israeli state is key to reaching a settlement with the Palestinians .
If Israel is going to offer a substantial compromise , passing over the overwhelming majority of the West Bank and Gaza to full Palestinian control and there will be a Palestinian state next to us , then we have to have an understanding that for such a historic compromise , that it is the end of the conflict , that there are no longer Palestinian claims against Israel and that the two states will be living together in peace .
Israeli spokesman Mark Rengav .
The remains of four sailors killed in the `` USS Cole '' bombing returned to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware today .
They were the last of the dead to be flown home , but in Yemen , the search for those responsible for the bombing continues .
Investigators turned up new evidence and more leads today .
ABC 's John Miller reports .
Investigators have searched at least half a dozen homes around the port of Aden including this one , trying to retrace the movements of what they believe may be six or more suspects .
This house on Al Zaharah Street half a mile from the port is where investigators believe the bomb was built into the boat that carried it .
Just after the men moved in , neighbors say they erected a metal corrugated wall to block the neighbors ' view of the yard .
Investigators say the men who lived here worked on the boat behind these walls in the last few days of their stay almost constantly .
At first , neighbors were curious , but later they complained about the noise .
On the day of the bombing , neighbors saw the boat leaving through these gates pulled by a Nissan 4 x 4 truck .
The trip from the house to the harbor was only about a mile , then six miles by water to the spot where the American destroyer was refueling .
Today , FBI agents and divers were collecting evidence near the place they believe the boat was lowered into the water just before the attack on the `` USS Cole '' which killed 17 sailors and two suicide bombers .
Investigators have come up with a series of names of possible suspects found on papers in the houses and cars they searched .
In some cases , they have some names .
They have not been able to verify whether they 're accurate , true names .
In other cases , I do n't believe they have identities yet .
Yemeni sources say some of the bombers may have used ID cards issued by a government registration center 35 miles from Aden .
Today , at the walled - in headquarters of the government security agency , the manager of that center and several clerks who worked there were among dozens who have been detained and questioned .
Investigators are aware that a few weeks before the bombing , accused terrorist leader Osama Bin Laden released a videotape calling for holy war against Americans in the Gulf .
American investigators also say the way the bombers organized the plot in Aden has stark similarities to the way Bin Laden 's cells have operated in the past , but , they concede , while they are closer to learning the names of the bombers , they are still a long way from knowing or proving who sent them .
John Miller , ABC News , Aden .
Today , U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen promised to catch and punish those responsible for the bombing of the `` Cole '' and defended the Navy 's decision to refuel ships in Yemen as investigators continued their day at work .
Morton Dean reports it 's a difficult day for the sailors remaining on board .
The stressful , monumental task for the crew on the U.S. carrier suffered a setback .
The ship began to take on water and lost electrical power again .
A difficult time became even more difficult .
It led to the cancellation of a memorial service planned for the 17 sailors who lost their lives .
Details are becoming known about the damage , most obvious , the huge hole , but also the deck is buckled .
Even the superstructure is damaged .
Hatches twisted out of shape and bulkheads destroyed .
Rear Admiral Mark Fitzgerald , who visited the Cole , was stunned by the damage .
I wo n't tell you whether the ship is going to sink or not sink , but there was considerable damage to the ship .
According to U.S. officials here tonight , the most important questions about the attack remain unanswered .
Any details or speculation on who specifically , we do n't know that at this point .
With well over 100 U.S. investigators now in Yemen , the search for evidence is now fully under way .
It 's been officially designated `` Operation Determined Response , '' and that suggests several things that the U.S. , of course , is determined to discover who carried out the bombing and that any group who helped plan the attack faces a response from the U.S. military .
The U.S. believes there are anti-American terror groups based in Yemen .
Half the population lives in settlements with 500 people or less , and senior U.S. officials here say the government , although friendly to the United States , does not have full control over the entire country .
Yemen 's President has repeatedly said an internal explosion rocked the `` USS Cole , '' but tomorrow U.S. officials expect him to announce that he has changed his mind , and tomorrow , the search for bodies will resume .
Ten U.S. sailors are still missing .

Good evening .
That call to order you just heard reverberates through the Supreme Court every day that the justices convene , but today was no everyday session .
Never before has the United States Supreme Court taken up a case that could decide a presidential election .
It did today .
That session of the Supreme Court and two defeats for Al Gore in Florida courts dominate the news today .
We start with the U.S. Supreme Court , specifically at issue , an appeal from the campaign of George W. Bush that the Florida Supreme Court had exceeded its authority when it ruled Florida counties could have more time to hand - count ballots .
Throughout an hour and a half of argument , the justices were aggressive in peppering lawyers with questions , and they seemed interested on two issues .
Was there a federal issue involved that would even require the U.S. Supreme Court to rule ? and if so , did the Florida Supreme Court improperly rewrite Florida law , as Governor Bush contends ?
A sure sign of the historic nature of the day 's proceeding , for the first time ever , the court immediately released an audiotape of the arguments .
But in the courtroom , listening in person was ABC 's Jackie Judd .
Even now , hours after that hearing ended , there are still protesters circling the Supreme Court .
As boisterous as the protesters were , nothing intruded on the ritual inside .
The chief justice and the associate justices of the Supreme Court of the United States .
The courtroom was packed .
Al Gore 's top campaign aides , his children , Republican senators and congressmen , they were all there .
God save the United States and this honorable court .
First up , Ted Olson lawyer for George W. Bush , laying out the campaign 's main claim .
Olson made it through only 56 seconds of his arguments before a justice broke in .
Well , Mr. Olson --
Sandra Day O'Connor , often the swing vote on this court , demanded to know why the court even had a role in this case .
Olson argued that a century - old federal statute prevents laws governing an election from being created after the fact which , he claimed , is just what the Florida court did , and also , that the U.S. Constitution gives state legislatures , not the courts , the right to choose electors .
Of all the justices it was Ruth Bader Ginsburg who seemed most sympathetic to the Florida Supreme Court .
Midway through the hearing , Chief Justice Rehnquist seemed to scold his colleagues for being too talkative when he made an unusual offer to the lawyer representing Florida 's Attorney General .
And so it went on .
Laurence Tribe , Gore 's attorney , said the state court did nothing illegal .
It simply provided a way for a close election to be examined .
Justice O'Connor again , but this time suggesting the state court had overstepped its authority and perhaps there was a federal case here .
Justice Antonin Scalia also pressed Tribe .
He said the state court relied on the Florida Constitution to draft its decision , excluding state lawmakers and that violated the U.S. Constitution .
It was Justice Breyer who asked the most straightforward question of all .
What happens if the court rules in favor of Bush ?
The answer from the Secretary of State 's lawyer was , Bush wins and all the litigation in Florida ends .
Not everyone agrees .
They say that no matter which way the court rules , it will not provide nearly so much finality to this presidential election .
Charlie ?
Jackie Judd at the Supreme Court .
Our thanks .
We have an exclusive report tonight about the `` USS Cole , '' and an identical attack that was planned , but failed , several months earlier .
Here 's ABC 's John M Wethy .
ABC News has learned that the terrorists who attacked the `` USS Cole '' originally planned to hit a different American warship in the same port ten months earlier .
The attack was to be part of a worldwide effort during celebration of the millennium that included targets in Jordan and Seattle .
Intelligence sources say the target was to be a destroyer , the `` USS The Sullivans , '' which refueled in Yemen 's port of Aden in January .
Sources tell ABC News that a suspect who has been in custody for several weeks told Yemeni investigators that his group failed in their attack because their small boat , overloaded with explosives , sank just off the beach .
The suspect said it took months to repackage and redesign the load of high explosives that was eventually used against `` the Cole . ''
John M Wethy , ABC News , the Pentagon .
After George W. Bush is sworn in , Bill Clinton will head to New York .
The President has said he and his wife , now a New York senator will spend weekends at their house in Chappaqua .
Mr. Clinton will also spend time at his presidential library in Arkansas .
He says he will come to Washington , `` every now and then . ''
The `` USS Cole '' has arrived back at the Mississippi shipyard where she was built .
ABC 's John M. Wethy reports tonight before the attack on the ship , the crew failed to take at least 25 % of the 80 different steps to protect the ship before landing in Yemen .
An investigation is already under way .
The ship 's captain is going to take a lot of heat for the 17 sailors who died .
The ship will sail again .
It will be one of the first election returns on Tuesday .
It will also be among the most important .
As we continue our coverage of presidential politics with a look at the last - minute battle to win a crucial swing state , Florida .
25 electoral votes .
It 's being fought over hard .
With a look at how the candidates are getting out the vote there , here 's NBC News correspondent Kerry Sanders .
The image of Florida , both fact and fiction .
A great getaway , a state where a mouse wields more power than a tropical paradise .
While the mild winters make this comfortable living for almost three million seniors , the largest elderly population in the United States , this year it is not the weather drawing Al Gore and George W. Bush to the Sunshine State .
Both candidates list 25 reasons to keep coming back , Florida 's 25 electoral votes .
Polls show Florida is still up for grabs .
Both candidates have been here almost equally .
In fact , it 's almost I dare you politics .
Each of them dares the other one to spend less time , money , and energy than they are at their own peril .
Elderly voters once again in Florida , the most important voting bloc because they actually vote more than any other group .
In this election , 45 % of those going to the voting booth are expected to be over the age of 65 .
The issue most important to them , Social Security .
Pay down the nation 's debt , strengthen Social Security , cut taxes for middle class family , save our environment .
Experience .
Vision .
Values .
Al Gore .
Why does Al Gore say one thing when the truth is another ?
His attacks on George Bush 's Social Security plan , exaggerations .
The truth , nonpartisan analysis confirms George Bush 's plan sets aside $ 2.4 trillion to strengthen Social Security .
Both candidates repeatedly talking about that one issue , but in Florida where there are more than 550 children born every day , families drive the other campaign issues .
Polls show education , the environment , and the candidate 's character will influence who voters choose .
And in this diverse state with a 15 % Hispanic population , both candidates courting their votes in ways not seen in any previous election .
Following both conventions , Gore and Bush granted their first live TV interviews to this man .
His name , Jorge Ramos , the Tom Brokaw of Spanish language news .
The race gets really , really close , and let 's suppose that states like Florida and Illinois might decide the election .
maybe , maybe Hispanic votes might decide , too , who would be the next President of the United States .
The largest Hispanic voting bloc of Florida , Republican voters who do not seem to be crossing the party line .
Gore wanted the young Cuban boy , Elian Gonzalez to stay in this country .
Joe Lieberman brings Gore support he probably would have gotten here anyway .
Sizable Jewish and African - American voting blocs .
Of the 10 largest states , Florida is the most Republican .
The Republican governor here , Jeb Bush was once expected to deliver his brother this state .
The managers of both campaigns saying in the end , the wipper may simply be determined by who gets more people to the voting booth .
Kerry Sanders , NBC News , Anaheim .
There was , of course , a team of attorneys on both sides of this live network coverage over the weekend of this trial going on in the courtroom in Florida , and , of course , among the teams of lawyers on the Bush side , one of the leaders , Ben Ginsberg , one of the lawyers who argued the case in Leon County Circuit Court .
He 's with us tonight , victorious in Tallahassee , Florida , and Ben , whatever the outcome today , and you were on the upside , you are forced now to go along with the appeals process as is the right of the Gore team .
What is your reaction to the work that will cause ?
Well , I mean , we 're certainly prepared to brief all the issues .
I think that the circuit court judge , Judge Sauls gave a very well reasoned and thorough , both legal and factual discussion of Florida law .
Well , let 's talk about your statement earlier today that the Vice President -- I guess you were asked should the Vice President concede , and you answered , the Vice President should do what 's best for the United States .
Is that what you 're trying to say ?
Well , sure .
I mean , I think that all the people involved in this unique situation , the first time a presidential election in our history has been contested , Brian , need to do the right thing , and I 'm sure do the right thing , as they see fit .
Do you think the judge there , in addition to just giving out his ruling at the end of the court session today , he went on beyond the basic issues and added reason upon reason for why he turned down the Gore case .
Do you think his method there was to try to make this more or less appeal proof ?
Well , I think what he did was addressed the situation as it exists in Florida and addressed the contingencies that were raised in the voluminous briefs that he had , not only from the two party candidates involved , but also of the interveners who were in the case .
As you know , the Democratic line throughout is they wo n't be happy until every vote is counted , and we could n't help but notice , should we call it a rhetorical device you used when talking to reporters this afternoon .
Pause and listen along with us to the following piece of videotape .
Those ballots have been counted not once on election night but twice in the recount and how many did you say there were ?
10,750 --
If you know the exact number , does n't that mean they 've been counted ?
So I do n't suppose that was any accident on your part ?
Well , they have been making this point throughout these proceedings that these ballots have never been counted , and that is factually not true .
They have been counted on election night -- they 've been counted in the recounts , and it simply happens to be not the case that those ballots have failed to be counted by anyone .
Ben , for better or worse , you are forced now to follow the Gore team as they take you on a kind of trail of appeal here .
If you were asked to predict whether this stops at the Florida or U.S. Supreme Court , what would your prediction be ?
I think it 's one of those situations where I would have predicted all , Brian .
I think that the decisions are not ours to make .
We 'll be involved in all the legal processes obviously as long as the Gore campaign keeps them up , no matter how long that takes .
Ben Ginsberg , attorney for the Bush team , victorious today in Tallahassee .
Thank you very much , after a long day , for being with us tonight .
Thanks , Brian .
The talks which the Secretary General of the Arab League Amr Moussa is holding in Lebanon for the second consecutive day , to find a way out of the current political crisis , have made progress according to what Moussa himself announced this afternoon from the offices of the Prime Minister , after he met Prime Minister Fuad Siniora , in the presence of the Sudanese President 's envoy Mustafa Osman Ismail .
We are now in the course of communicating , consulting , tracking and -- agreeing on many issues relating to the situation here .
By God we have reached , ah , I mean , to a mood , ah , much better in -- and we are talking with different parties .
It is not possible to achieve progress unless we reach with all parties , to , ah , a basis which all agree on , which has benefit and might have concession .
The important thing is that the basis and objective is the most famous Lebanese principle : no winner , no loser .
Moussa and Ismail 's round of talks included since this morning the Maronite leader Patriarch Sfeir , who supported the Arab initiative .
It also included MP Michel Aoun who is one of the pillars of the opposition .
Moussa said that the latter showed great understanding towards ending the climate of tension and reaching an agreement on all different frameworks which protect Lebanon .
There are issues that require now , ah -considering they are the main issues -- that we solve them , and there are other issues whose time and context will come , ah , this is not the context .
Moussa and his accompanying delegation also had consultations with former Lebanese President Amin Gemayel , who pointed out the economic , social and lifestyle results from all that is happening today , which are negative as a whole , if the situation is not rectified and work is not done to find appropriate solutions .
Moussa met also the head of the Democratic Gathering , MP Walid Jumblatt , the prominent personality in the parliamentary and government majority .
Moussa announced that his consultations will be repeated as well with the head of the government and the speaker of parliament before meeting President of the Republic Emile Lahoud tomorrow .
The Somali Islamic Courts announced that Ethiopia had invaded the country and called on all Somalis to expel them .
The Courts also said that its fighters killed 203 Ethiopians , and wounded twice this number , .
Lines are intertwined in Somalia with the escalation of events that raise many questions .
Has that country reached the brink of an all - out war that may drag into it , in one way or another , most of the Horn of Africa states ?
And , is it possible to resume the Khartoum negotiations in light of the continued present complication of issues ?
The answer so far appears unclear .
The fighters of the Islamic Courts announced their control of the city of Ibla south of Baidoa , the headquarters of the transitional government , after killing dozens of Ethiopian soldiers in that city .
They warned about the likelihood of opening new fighting fronts in the town of Jaree , where they say Ethiopian troops have entered .
<foreign lang="unknown"> </foreign>
We want the entire world to know that Ethiopia has invaded Somalia and the war now is with the Ethiopian government .
All the people of Somalia are urged to repel this invasion .
So far we have defeated the enemies , but I call on all the people to rise up to expel the enemy out of the country .
The Somali transitional government has acknowledged the violent fighting taking place in the south of the country ,
but it has described it as occurring between the forces of the government and the fighters of the Islamic Courts that reject the country 's legitimate authority .
It has denied any connection with the Ethiopians or others in the matter .
Parliament has approved dispatching forces to help us train , uh , the national forces .
So the Ethiopian forces are from these , are among these forces .
And in such deteriorating conditions in which all sides exchange blame , dense fog seems to surround the outcome of the mission undertaken over the last few days by Louis Michel , the European Union Aid Commissioner .
Michel had announced that the parties to the conflict have agreed to stop fighting , but this has not yet happened .
He also announced the agreement by the concerned parties to resume the Khartoum negotiations .
And it appears that the only remaining glimmer of hope to extinguish the fuse is for the parties to go to Khartoum without conditions , despite the difficulties entailed with accomplishing this .
Lebanon , Iraq and other hot issues were for the most part the gist of the call with which the Gulf leaders concluded their 27th summit in Riyadh .
Yes , Dalila , the concluding statement of the Riyadh summit warned against the partition of Iraq and demanded that parties it left unnamed not interfere in the internal affairs of Iraq .
Certainly , the summit did not conclude this session without an overview of progress on the customs union and the steps for establishing the Gulf Common Market .
Faiza Allaj .
The session was in the Gulf , but the flavor that characterized the atmosphere of the Cooperation Council summit was a blend of the crisis issues of the region , each according to its degree of urgency .
But Iraq , with its worsening situation , won a large share of the concluding statement of the Jaber Summit .
The security and stability of Iraq can only be achieved with the cooperation of all its people , regardless of their denominational , ethnic or religious affiliations , as well as their joint efforts to give precedence to the interests of Iraq over all considerations , preserve the unity of its people and its territory , and reject the calls for division and partition .
Iran , which was implicitly reminded not to interfere in the affairs of Iraq , was explicitly mentioned with the expression of Gulf concerns for its possession of nuclear programs .
And on the rest of the Arab crises , and in particular Lebanon , the Gulf leaders called on all parties to adhere to the constitutional and legitimate institutions of that country and condemned the return to acts of violence and political assassinations .
Concerning Palestine , a call was issued to speed up the formation of a national unity government and reject political conflicts between the two movements , Fatah and Hamas .
The concluding statement of the Jaber Summit reviewed in detail the progress made on the customs union and the steps for the establishment of the Gulf Common Market .
It approved allowing the citizens of the Council to exercise a number of economic activities .
Those are the steps that are expected to complete the process of economic integration , which is what all the peoples of the Gulf want .
Iran today held elections for the Leadership Experts Council , in addition to municipal councils and complementary elections for the Islamic Consultative Assembly .
Numerous lists are competing in these elections .
Competition was greater for the municipal councils which are close to the lives of citizens and the services these councils provide to solve these citizens ' problems such as unemployment and inflation .
The Leadership Experts Council bears responsibility for supervising the work of the supreme leader or guide of the political regime in addition to elections if there is n't one .
Candidates for the Leadership Experts Council are required to be highly knowledgeable in Islamic religious sciences whereas candidates to municipal councils do not have to be .
The conservatives were divided into three lists in the municipal elections . While the reformists lined up in one list in the hope of winning these elections which are considered an indicator for upcoming elections , whether presidential or Consultative Assembly elections .
Of the three conservative lists , the first backed Iranian President Ahmedinejad . While the second backed Tehran 's mayor and the former presidential candidate , Mohammed Baqer Qalibaf .
The Chairman of the Consultative Assembly , Haddad Adel , backed the third list called the Reformist Conservatives .
While the conservatives monopolized the Leadership Experts Councils , competition for the municipal councils was abundant .
Results for these council elections indicate the acceptability of the presidency of President Ahmedinejad .
They also have an effect on the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections .

Russia 's lower house of parliament has overwhelmingly approved restoring the former Soviet anthem as the Russian national anthem .
The move had the strong support of Russian President Vladimir Putin who said use of the old anthem represented a gesture of reconciliation .
Critics argued that the anthem is a throwback to the former totalitarian government .
The anthem will have new words , eliminating verses that praised Communist leaders Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin .
The lower house of parliament also gave formal endorsement to Russia 's white , red and blue flag but reinstated the old red and gold Soviet flag as the flag of the military .

The Yugoslav Army has given its support to President - elect Vojislav Kostunica .
Earlier he had an hour long meeting with former President Slobodan Milosevic .
It 's the first meeting since Milosevic was ousted by a popular revolt .
He conceded defeat and congratulated his successor .
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright says , the lifting of international sanctions against Serbia can now be discussed .
Our sanctions regime is not against the people of Serbia , it was against Milosevic , and if Milosevic is gone then there are many ways that the sanctions regime can be changed and lifted and adjusted .
Albright says Milosevic must not be allowed to maintain any position of power .
Earlier Russia also recognized Kostunica as Yugoslavia 's new leader .
Visiting Foreign Minister Evan Holf told Milosevic his time is up .

Clashes between Israeli Army units and Palestinians have continued into the night .
That 's after another day of violence in which four Palestinians were killed .
Helicopter gunships were deployed around the West Bank village of Bagella .
Exchanges of fire between Israelis and Palestinians have also been reported around Jericho , Greg Barrow reports .
A day of violence across the West Bank and Gaza has been followed by more clashes after nightfall .
Houses in the West Bank village of Bagella have been attached by Israeli helicopter gunships .
An Israeli military spokesman said they were deployed in response to gun fire from Palestinians inside Bagella , which was aimed at the Jewish settlement of Kilo .
The Israelis say the helicopters went into action firing machine guns , but unconfirmed reports from inside Bagella suggested rockets may have been used .

Both George W. Bush and Al Gore today continue to press their cases literally and figuratively .
Their PR machines seem to be functioning smoothly .
Governor Bush 's running mate Dick Cheney talked with reporters about the Republican transition plans , another signal that Bush is getting ready to become the next President of the United States .
Meanwhile , Vice President Gore continued his appeal for patience while he contests Bush 's claim to victory , and attorneys for both men were preparing for key court battles later in the week , which could settle the three - week dispute over who won Florida and the presidency .
The World 's Clark Boyd has the latest .
All eyes were on Florida yet again today as lawyers , judges , lawmakers and citizens , all picked at the knots that have tied up the conclusion of this presidential election for the past three weeks .
Yesterday in Leon County Circuit Court , Judge N. Sander Sauls set a Saturday deadline for a hearing on vote recounts and ordered the roughly 14000 contested ballots in Miami Dade and Palm Beach counties , not to mention a sample voting machine and voting booth , to be brought to Tallahassee under police escort .
Today , as officials in both two counties ready the ballots for transport , George W. Bush 's lawyers asked the judge to order all 1.16 million ballots from the two counties to be trucked to the state capital .
Late this afternoon , Judge Sauls granted that motion .
In Washington , Vice President Al Gore was back on television this morning trying to shore up public support for his legal cause .
In a taped interview , for NBC 's Today Show , Gore said despite all the legal maneuvering he is calling on both camps to put partisan politics aside .
I think that both Governor Bush and I should recognize an obligation during this time when the votes are still to be counted , to try to restrain the passions of our partisan supporters .
Meanwhile , Bush 's vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney was a busy man today .
After a heart checkup at a Washington hospital he appeared at a news conference to say that he is pressing ahead with transition plans .
We have now acquired office space in McClain , Virginia that will become the site for the transition operation that we announced two days ago , so we are just in a business of getting up and running , but we now have an office with a lot of space .
We have got people signing up , volunteers coming on , telephones being put in and computers , so we will be fully operational within the next day or two .
Earlier today in Florida , the Republican dominated legislature began hearings on calling a special session to pick the state 's electors itself , should the December 12th deadline still find the election tied up in the courts .
The committee heard from angry voters and precinct workers in Palm Beach .
I believe our issues do relate directly to the appointing of electors for the state of Florida .
The electors need to be appointed , are supposed to be appointed according to the will of the people and I believe in Palm Beach County that it was very difficult to determine what the will of the people was .
Although Al Gore said today that he certainly feels like he won the election , he put his odds of wining the various legal battles at fifty - fifty .
Gore said , if Bush does triumph in court , he will throw his support behind the Republican President - elect .
But for now , says former Clinton administration cabinet member Robert Riche , both sides are positive that they 've won the election , and says Riche , the longer the fight goes on , the more troublesome the next four years might be .
What we risk by prolonging this is greater public cynicism and a hardening of partisan lines among career politicians who have to work together .
After all , come January , these people are going to have to be in Washington whether Gore or Bush is the President .
You have a lot of politicians in Congress who are going to have to work together with the new President and with each other , so we do n't want to prolong this forever .
The US Supreme Court will hear arguments from both sides on Friday and Florida 's Leon County Circuit Court will consider the arguments on disputed state ballots on Saturday , and while the nation wearies of the protracted legal battle maybe Leon County Circuit Court judge N. Sander Sauls said it best .
The whole process , he said , is a bit like being nibbled to death by a duck .

Novelist and playwright Gao Xingjian today became the first Chinese language author to win the Nobel Prize for Literature .
Gao Xingjian 's avant - garde plays made him persona non-grata in his native China and he fled the country in 1988 .
He settled in France becoming a French citizen two years ago .
Gregory Lee is a professor of Chinese and Chinese literature at the University of Lyons in France .
Professor Lee , I gather you know the man and know his work .
Tell us a little bit about him , Who is he and why did he flee China .
Gao Xingjian is quite an interesting writer because in some senses he differs from the great cohort of contemporary Chinese writers that are well known in the West today .
I would say that the great difference about Gao Xingjian is that he actually received a university education .
He was educated in French , so has a very good knowledge of French literature and it is very much French literature that has influenced his own literary creativities , only free production , so much so that conservative Chinese critics would accuse him of blind worship of Western models .
Sartre is a big man in Mr. Xingjian 's life , is n't he ?
I would say so that Sartre has been a quite a big influence .
I think the other influences would be Samuel Beckett , the Irish and French language writer , Unesco .
These are models and , of course , all of these writers are writers who were active in the first half of the twentieth century .
Well , this is very interesting because Mr. Gao left China before Tianenmen .
He wrote a play , in particular about the events there .
Would you say that his influences may be more French literary then they were his own immediate life experience ?
I would say both , in fact , because the first play that he wrote that made him famous was a play that dates from 1981 , which was actually called ` Bus Stop ' , which many people said or had resonances from Beckett 's play ` Waiting for Godot ' and it concerned a number of Chinese people from different walks of life who were standing at a bus stop waiting for a bus that never came .
So , we can see immediately that the resonances with the play of Beckett , but Gao Xingjian really before 1989 felt , that he was unable to write and to have his plays produced , as he would wish , and so left China couple of years before the incident at Tiananmen in 1989 .
I think it is a great day for modern Chinese literature and it is a day that has been awaited for the past 60 to 70 years .
Gregory Lee is a professor of Chinese and Chinese literature at the University of Lyons , France .
He spoke to us from his home in Provence .
Professor , thank you very much for speaking with us .
Not at all .
Thank you very much .

Well we ca n't tell you who won Florida , but in a moment we will enter the musical question , who let the dogs out ?
First up we have the answer to our geo quiz today .
We are looking for a region of central Italy bordering the Adriatic Sea .
The area is mostly mountainous and includes Mt. Corno , the highest peak of the Apennines .
It also includes a lot of sheep , good clean - living , healthy sheep , and an Italian entrepreneur has an idea about how to make a little money of them .
The answer is Abruzzo .
Journalist Carlos Depalazai was in Rome , Italy and Carlo how does this fellow plan to profit from the sheep of the Abruzzo ?
He is taking advantage of two crazes that we are having in the Italy at the moment , one is internet , the other one is the awareness on food .
So this guy came up with the idea of having people adopting sheep by an internet .
So you can have access through your computer on your desk .
Go to the web site of these guys and you can have look at the face of sheep which are available to be adopted .
So what does it mean to adopt a sheep , to show up on your back step or do you , somehow keep track of its progress on the farm in Italy ?
You are not actually adopting the sheep in the sense that you can have it with you .
It looks like distant adoption , where you do n't actually have the child in your home .
You are just contributing with a certain amount of money and you are monitoring the growing up .
It works in the same way , so you have access on the web site of this little farm , in a little village of Abrutzi and you can choose among many , many sheeps and after contributing with a certain amount of money the sheep is actually yours .
All right , so the amount of money you have mentioned to us is about 160 US dollars and for that you get more than just a warm and fuzzy feeling .
You can also receive leggings that are made from wool of the sheep and even if you like some of the sheep dropping delivered to your door .
Yeah , I mean this is quite funny , but apart from all the details , which are sometimes even strange I think what is really important is that it is a sign of a new concern that is effecting Italian people .
I mean we are notoriously lover of good food .
We have a generous attitude towards food , and this is a new stuff .
The fact that you really care about a sheep in the way she is fed , in the way she is nurtured , in the way people are looking after it , because it 's a way to ensure that you have something which is genuine on your table up the end .
Wait a minute , you said that on your table at the end .
Yeah , at the table if it becomes food for instance , which is an option .
You are adopting the sheep and whatever happens at the end it 's your choice and among the option is you know food for your meal .
That kind of puts a whole new tone to this thing .
I mean usually when you think of this kind of adoption that means saving an animal not eventually eating it .
I mean this is an option which is available and I think it is a sort of provocation .
You know Italians now mainly live in metropolitan areas in big cities like Rome , Florence , Naples .
In the past , we were a population of shepherds or farmers .
We had completely different attitude towards nature .
It seems that we are losing something , and we need to reestablish a better relationship with nature and the simple fact that the Environment Minister in Italy supported the initiative and he himself adopted a sheep is significant .
He took advantage immediately of these ideas to build up a new awareness and a new attitude of Italians towards nature and farms .
Carlo De Blazia , journalist speaking to us from Rome .
Thank you very much Carlo .
Nice to talk to you .
Thank you .

George W. Bush has met with Al Gore in Washington .
The two men met for just 15 minutes at the Vice President 's official residence .
It 's the first time they 've been face to face since the bitterly contested presidential election was finally concluded last week .
Bush went into the talks with his defeated rival after meeting with President Clinton earlier today .
At a photo opportunity in the Oval Office , Bush thanked the President and fended off an interruption from a veteran White House correspondent .
I am humbled and honored , and I ca n't thank the President enough for his hospitality .
He did n't need to do this .
Yes , he did .
I have n't quite finished yet .
And I am grateful and I am going to look forward to the discussion .
I am here to listen .
For his part President Clinton said his only advice to Bush is to assemble a good team and to do what he thinks is right .
Bush is now heading back to Texas .

There are mounting allegations of police and military brutality in Zimbabwe .
But President Robert Mugabe has deployed troops to quell rioting over the rising price of food .
There are sharp increases here just as Zimbabwe has slumped into its worst economic crisis since becoming independent in 1980 .
In three days of unrest Army helicopters have dropped teargas in poor suburbs of the capital Harare , but many of those protesting say they wo n't stop until Mugabe , the man they blame for the country 's economic problems , surrenders the presidency .
From Harare the BBC 's Grant Ferrett reports .
Protestors in one of Harare 's poor southern townships run for cover as riot police fire teargas from the top of an armored vehicle .
Such confrontations have been taking place all over the south of the capital for several days .
The aim is twofold , to demand a halt to the rising prices of basics such as food , fuel and transport , as well as the resignation of President Mugabe .
People are demonstrating for the price increase fuel and everything .
They are trying to stay away .
They do n't want to go to work .
They want to stay away .
So what happened here , can you tell me ?
We set a barricade , not for our people but for the police .
We do n't want them .
We want them to go .
And what have the police done ?
They are rounding up people to clear our barricade , forcing them , beating them , throwing teargas canisters into school children , but the war here has just started .
Nearly four months after Zimbabwe 's bloodiest parliamentary elections , the economy has gone from bad to worse .
President Mugabe 's vitriolic attacks on the west combined with continuing lawlessness , particularly on white owned commercial farms have driven away donors , investors and tourists .
Zimbabwe now has Africa 's fastest shrinking economy .
Many of us like to characterize Zimbabwe 's crisis as an economic crisis but it is wider and deeper than economy .
Simba Makoni looks and sounds like an opposition politician .
In fact , he is the recently appointed finance minister .
You can see the price of bread go up , you can see your bus fares go up , you can see companies closing down or working short weeks and that sort of thing , but you can also read Zimbabwe 's crisis in the number of destitute people on the streets , in the number of crimes being committed .
245 !
245 !
Zimbabwe earns the bulk of its hard currency here on the tobacco auction floors .
This year 's crop is down because of the continuing occupation of white owned farms .
When the selling season ends next month , foreign exchange reserves , hardly estimated to cover just a few days of imports , are likely to completely dry up .
Without them , paying for central imports such as fuel and electricity will become even more difficult .
What we have right now is a political crisis and until that political crisis is resolved , there is no way the economy is going to improve .
The sentiments of economist Howard Setoli are widely shared .
With eighteen months to go until scheduled presidential elections , Zimbabwe is headed for complete economic ruin .
If government continues on its current path , the economy will continue to contract .
This year it was expected to contract by 8 % .
Next year we see a further contraction of 12 % .
So we are talking of massive unemployment , severe foreign exchange shortage .
It is an alarming prediction .
For those taking part in the protests on the streets , after two decades in office they want President Mugabe to go now .
We want a new President .
The situation is like Yugoslavia now .
We do n't want Mugabe .
No more .
For The World , I am Grant Ferrett , in Harare .
Five years ago today , the agreement ending the war in Bosnia was initialed in Dayton Ohio .
Western leaders were n't wild about relying on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to help implement the accord , but they felt they had no choice .
Five years later , the West and the United States in particular are n't counting on the deposed leader for anything .
They want to see his successor Vojislav Kostinica extradite Milosevic through the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague , but not only is Milosevic still living comfortable in Belgrade , last night he made his first TV appearance in six weeks , giving a pep talk to his supporters .
The World 's Jeb Sharp reports on the still unresolved fate of Slobodan Milosevic .
He 's kept Western diplomats spinning in circles for more than a decade .
Five years ago they were negotiating with Milosevic at Dayton to stop the war in Bosnia .
Two years ago they were still shuttling back and forth to Belgrade in an effort to solve the Kosovo crisis .
By March of last year they had given up talking and Nato had started bombing instead .
When Milosevic was indited on war crimes charges soon after , US and other Western officials began calling for his arrest and transfer to The Hague , but now that a delicate transition is underway in Serbia , those calls have grown quieter , according to Gary Bass , the author of the new book about war crimes trials , ` Stay , the Hand of Vengeance ' .
Even Madeleine Albright , who is with the President who is usually most decipherous about the importance of prosecuting war criminals , has in fact said that our first priority is making sure that Vojislov Kostunica can consolidate his democratic government and make that transition , and the issue of punishing war criminals sort of takes a back seat .
Bass says US diplomats do n't want to risk destabilizing Serbia 's fragile political situation by pushing too hard for war crimes trials .
After all Bass points out , outside pressure has backfired in the past .
In Germany after World War I and in the Ottoman Empire also after World War I , the British and the French pushed really hard for war crimes trials , and the result in both countries was a kind of a nationalist backlash .
A nationalist backlash in Serbia right now could play into Milosevic 's hands , especially with parliamentary elections scheduled for next month .
That 's one reason Western governments are not demanding his immediate arrest , but critics of this approach say letting Milosevic stay in Belgrade could be equally destabilizing .
Eva Barnetts , professor of history at Yale , says President Kostunica should cooperate immediately with the Hague Tribunal .
This particular UN institution has in its power really to give instant legitimacy to Kostunica but of course at a price .
It means that the government of Yugoslavia has to become very serious about dealing with the indited war criminals , beginning with Slobodan Milosevic himself .
But even officials at The Hague say they are willing to be patient with the new Yugoslav President .
Tribunal spokesman Jim Landel says it helps that Kostunica 's people who initially refused to even entertain the idea of arresting Milosevic , may be starting to cooperate with the Tribunal .
They have already indicated that they are willing to allow the reopening of the prosecutor 's liaison office in Belgrade , and that 's certainly a welcome first step .
However , it is only a first step .
The Tribunal 's chief prosecutor Carla Del Ponte has applied for a Yugoslav visa and plans to visit Belgrade soon .
Delponte 's spokeswoman says the prosecutor has much to discuss with Kostunica , not least how to arrest all the indited war crimes suspects now in Serbia .
That wo n't be easy .
Even in Bosnia where Nato is in charge , troops have failed to capture Bosnian - Serb leader Radavan Karadzic , indited on genocide charges in connection with the 1995 massacre at Shrabanitca .
Yale history professor Eva Barnett says the excuses for not arresting Karadzic are not persuasive .
The claim is that this would engender tremendously destabilizing consequences that in any event it might be a very , very bloody affair and so on .
This does not seem terribly compelling to me .
I think that it has to be tried and of course there is always a danger that somebody might get hurt in this , but that is a danger that every attempt at remedying criminal activity has to face .
Hague prosecutor Carla Del Ponte is prepared to discuss arrest strategies with Kostunica including the use of foreign troops .
It 's difficult to know how he would react .
Kostunica has questioned the legality of the Hague Tribunal , and talked of trying Milosevic in Yugoslavia .
Still , Kostunica 's grace period wo n't last forever .
When the US Congress approved one hundred million dollars in aid to Serbia last month , it stipulated the aid would stop flowing if Belgrade has n't cooperated with the tribunal by March 31st .

The head of the Palestinian Television and Radio has been shot dead in the Gaza Strip .
Masked gunmen opened fire on Hisham Mekki at a hotel in Gaza City but the motive for the attack is unclear .
You 're listening to BBC News .
The Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is due to meet with Egypt 's President Mubarak in Cairo on Thursday .
The encounter is being seen as an effort by Barak to drum up regional support for a Middle East peace agreement based on President Clinton 's proposals .
They require Israel to relinquish sovereignty over most of Arab East Jerusalem and the Palestinians to scale back their demand for a return of refugees , but Palestinian chief negotiator Sayeb Erekat says more details are required before both sides can strike a deal .
We have so many questions that we have ... so many points that need to be clarified .
The most important thing is the clarity .
The most important thing is that we focus on the travails of the peace process .
Israeli settlers are worried that most of the settlements in the West Bank will be dismantled if an agreement is reached .
The spokeswoman for this Settlers ' Council Yahudi Tayar says this is unacceptable .
We have a situation where instead of protecting the interests of the Jewish people , the Israeli Prime Minister is willing to forgo on all of the vital and important areas and not only our history , but the security of the future for the Jewish people in Israel .
More than 300 people have been killed in the West Bank and Gaza Strip since September .
Let 's talk a little bit more about what the Navy does to prevent such tragedies .
We were talking about it this morning and we put together some graphics for you .
I 'll try to explain it the best I can from what I remember from being on the `` USS Abraham Lincoln '' .
This is an amphibious ship , rather , but this is what the Navy does with regard to prevention .
, every sailor that 's entering the Navy does take a swim test .
They learn how to tread water and do the dead man float and they have to pass that in order to continue on .
Also drills take place before sailors get on to any ship , before any deployment .
Usually twice a day , they 're practicing man overboard drills , knowing where to go , where to report to if indeed a man overboard takes place and as the deployment begins , those wane off , but they know where to go quickly .
They also wear float coats .
You can see them here .
The yellow shirt is wearing a yellow float coat .
Everything is color coordinated .
You see the gentleman here wearing a brown one and they have toggles to pull and inflate .
They also have a manual device so if the toggles do n't work they can blow air into the inflation device .
They have dive goggles and they 're able to find them .
It also has a strobe light and a whistle .
Also such location devices , some ships have smoke floats they can toss out so the man overboard will be able to use smoke signals as a way of trying to , let the rescuer locate them .
Also 24 / 7 there are individuals on watch , all throughout the ship , all around the ship , and indeed , there is netting on most parts of the ship , not all around the entire ship , but on most parts there is a very thick netting .
Now let 's talk about the man overboard rescue and when indeed there is a man overboard situation .
You will hear a P.A. announcement around the entire ship , there is a man overboard so everyone knows they have to react quickly .
A ship - wide search will happen if they do n't see that person go overboard , but if indeed they do see someone go overboard , the ship starts to circle that area continuously .
Also small boats sometimes go out into the water , but even more importantly , helicopters are launched immediately .
Inside those helicopters rescue swimmers .
If indeed the man overboard is located , well the hoister is dropped down with usually a torso harness .
If the man overboard is injured then they may use a basket , but more than likely those swimmers will go right into the water and try and help the swimmer hook up on that harness and pull them up into the helo and pull them back on to the ship for treatment and usually a search takes about 24 hours .
The search crews will go 24 hours before calling off that search .
Why call it off ?
There 's a number of reasons to look at .
Depending on the water temperature , it 's very common in cold water that someone will not survive a certain amount of time .
Also the reason for the 24 - hour search is they fail they 've exhausted all resources by that time .
Anyway , we 'll continue to follow what 's happening on the `` USS Nassau '' as those investigations continue for the two missing sailors .
Make this final port call for some of these men and women on board who have been there for ten months at sea .
Chad Myers joining me on the set .
Typical perfect day in San Diego waiting for these men and women to come home .
Raining in L.a. , raining in San Francisco but nice in San Diego .
It 's a picture perfect place to live .
72 and sunny just about every day .
Have you ever been down there ?
No , I have not .
It is quite stunning .
It is beautiful out there .
I just think about all the family members sitting at home , sitting on the dock looking at this boat coming in .
It 's just amazing .
They were not on vacation .
They were in danger .
Your loved ones are in danger for ten months .
Is he okay today ?
Is she okay today ?
Incredible sight to see these young men and women .
They are children .
They are 18 , 19 , 20 years old .
Think about when I was 18 , I was thinking about going to college .
These guys are running ships .
Some of these , as you say , are children .
Some of these had children while they were out at sea and this is first opportunity to get home and meet and hold them .
We 've seen the reunions for the past week or so .
It brings a lot of emotion .
It 's going to be hard for me to hold back tears .
We 're watching from the sidelines .
You can just imagine what these people must be thinking and how antsy they must be .
Got to think the last five minutes must feel like five days as they 've spent ten months on the water .
Just about to come home .
Sense the anticipation there beginning to build on those docks .
Friend of mine in Richmond , Virginia , on the radio up there WRBA .
His son was on one of the ships that escorted a carrier , although this came home by itself from Hawaii .
There are so many other ships out there that escort this ship as it goes out .
It 's just not one ship , not just 5,000 people .
It is a battle group that goes out .
Eight , nine , ten ships and a submarine .
While some of these ladies and gentlemen are going to be joining their families half of them are going to stay on board because the `` Lincoln '' is going to be docked in Everett , Washington .
That 's where the home base is .
It 's going to have to make a trip up the coast .
They wo n't get to see their loved ones until Tuesday or Wednesday .
I wonder who gets to get off first .
Is there a drawing ?
Was there a raffle ?
We 've got to deal with the person who 's going to be getting off here .
As you 've been watching throughout the morning , you 've been seeing that balloon , just getting back from spending a tour in Kuwait during the war .
Betsy is going to be leaving us .
She is jumping ship .
She is going on her own .
She was one of the water skiers .
We have to let her go .
She is going to be leaving us .
we do wish you the best , Betsy .
You know that .
It 's been a blast having you , been a pain in the butt sometimes , been big part of our group the entire time .
Love you , Betsy .
Thank you , Leon .
We 're going to say good-bye to Betsy .
Some of these ladies and gentlemen are going to be saying hello to their families , standing on the side of the ship , ca n't wait to get off there .
We 'll have that for you live .
These reunions .
That should be happening any moment now .
Stay with us .
Back in this city , a courthouse in Manhattan .
Sam Waksal , founder and former CEO of ImClone is scheduled to be sentenced today .
He pleaded guilty earlier this year to insider trading , bank fraud and tax evasion .
Waksal could be fined $ 3.5 million , facing a maximum of 75 years in prison , expected , though , to receive about six to seven years .
That 's the early indication we 've been given .
A friend of his , Martha Stewart , pleaded not guilty last week .
The charges related to her sale of ImClone stock .
She sold the share a day before bad news about the company sent the stock price falling , considerably .
Sam Waksal , sentenced , 10:00 a.m. , local time here in New York .
Now Saddam Hussein 's regime is no more , the focus in Iraq is turning from military action to rebuilding which means the coalition 's role in the country will have to change .
Military analyst and retired Army General Claudia Kennedy joins me with a look at possibilitys .
Good to have you with us .
From Texas politics now to Chinese censorship .
China today blacked out a CNN interview that was critical of the Chinese government 's handling of the SARs epidemic and of the country 's health care system .
China requires foreign broadcasters to use a Chinese satellite to serve their country .
Until last month it was routinely blocking almost all reports about Sars in China , a practice that has produced intense global criticism .
The British Broadcasting Company has also faced the censorship in China .
In 1993 Rupert Murdoch bought a controlling stake in China 's Star TV satellite system .
In 1994 the BBC World Service broadcasts were pulled from Star .
China was offended by the BBC 's news content and demanded that STAR TV remove it or lose permission to broadcast in China .
A year later Murdoch bought the rest of Star TV that he did not own .
Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp. has an extensive presence , of course in this country .
That presence may be expanding soon , if the FCC eases some of its broadcast rules .
Murdoch has lobbied hard for those changes .
They would allow him to buy even more U.S. television stations .
Next month the FCC is likely to accommodate him .
Murdoch today promised that if the rules are changed he will limit future purchases to a few of what he calls sizable markets .
Now an update on a story that touched all our lives .
Remember Ali Abbas who lost both his arms , his home , many of his relatives in a bombing on Baghdad ?
As you might imagine , his will to live was not very strong at first .
Mark Webster of ITN has an update for us .
Reporter :
After so much suffering , his gentle smile said it all .
Two weeks in hospital and Ali is recovering fast , happily watching Tom and Jerry on his mini television , his transformation from the pain - wracked boy who left Baghdad .
With the encouragement of his doctors , we visited him in the intensive care unit .
They 're confident he wo n't be here much longer .
I will say he will come out of the burn unit in three weeks time , but he will be , you know , in Kuwait until we find him really constructive plan that takes into consideration all aspects of his needs , psychological , social and future plan .
Reporter :
Since Ali is an ardent football fan , we gave him a Manchester United shirt specially signed by all the players .
Pride of place went to his favorite player , David Beckham , who surprised everyone with his response .
Thank you very much .

Freddie Mac is giving golden parachutes to two of its ousted executives .
Our Rhonda Schaffler is near New York Stock Exchange with the latest on this unfolding story , certainly one we have been hearing a lot about .
Reporter :
That 's right .
There 's a new development out .
This particular scandal has really captivated Wall Street this month .
Before I tell you how big those parachutes are , let me tell you what the U.S. Treasury Secretary is saying about it now .
John Snow making some comments a short time ago saying he backs tougher oversight for the company .
He also says his department is trying to determine if it has implication for the nation 's financial system .
Freddie Mac stock is down another 6.5 % today .
It has lost more than 207 % -- or about 20 % since Monday .
Monday , of course , is when the company fired its President for not cooperating with efforts to restate earnings for the last few years .

Investors learned last night the CEO is getting a severance package worth $ 24 million .
The ousted President is going to walk away with more than $ 6 million in vested openings .

Off the coast there was a dramatic rescue by a cruise ship ship .
Canada TV has the story and some dramatic pictures .
Reporter :
With winds bliping at more than 100 kilometers an hour , three men desperately cling to their sinking fishing boat .
The crew sent out a distress call after it started taking on water .
Suddenly we realized water came into the engine room and it was rising and they started to pump , of course , and they pumped and pumped and the water came more and more and more .
Reporter :
The ship was sinking by the second , and as the waves pounded against them , waiting for help was their only option .
Their life raft had already been snitched away by the high seas .
When we got the information , it was only 23 , 25 miles off , so we were quite close .
Reporter :
Still it took the Royal Caribbean cruise ship `` Raidience of the Seas '' almost an hour to reach the scene and despite the rough ocean , the captain immediately sent a boat in to save them .

They were swimming toward the boat .

We 're getting late word tonight that Geraldo Rivera may not be be kicked out of Iraq after all .
Originally the Central Command said the veteran Fox News correspond was being expelled because he compromised the location of the unit he 's been embedded with .
Now a spokesman from the Central Command is saying and I 'm quoting `` Frankly , we have bigger and more important things to do . ''
During a live broadcast Geraldo drew a map in the sand showing the location of the unit in relation to Baghdad .
Says he 's not aware he 's being expelled but says if so , it is because some bitter former colleagues of his at MSNBC blew the whistle on him .
It sounds to me like some rats at my former network , NBC , are spreading some lies about me .
You know , they ca n't compete fair and square on the battlefield so they 're trying to stab me in the back .
It is not first time .
The Central Command on the other hand says Rivera is being kicked out of Iraq because `` he gave away the big picture stuff . ''
All of this now under review , whether or not Geraldo stays or goes .
We 'll continue to monitor that front on the store yix another veteran war correspondent is being fired for his controversial conduct in Iraq .
NBC is terminating freelancer reporter Peter Arnett for statements he made to the Iraqi media .
We showed you the statements yesterday .
He said the coalition 's first war plan had failed because of Iraqi resistance .
Today he appeared on NBC 's `` Today '' show and said he was sorry .
I want to apologize to the American people for clearly making a misjudgment over the weekend by giving an interview to Iraqi television .
Now , I said in that interview essentially what we all know about the war , there have been delays in implementing policy , there has been surprises , but clearly by giving that interview to Iraqi television , I created a firestorm in the United States , and for that I am truly sorry .
Arnett had been covering the war for National Geographic , which also fired him as TV reports were given exclusively to NBC and MSNBC .
Late word from London that the tabloid the Daily Mirror just hired Peter Arnett to be its correspondent in Baghdad .
But the question remains Did Peter Arnett and Geraldo Rivera cross the line ? or were they within their rights as reporters ?
We posed that question to Michael Wolf , a contributing editor for `` New York '' magazine , a media columnist , an important article in the new issue of `` New York . ''
He 's joining us now live from Qatar .
What do you say to the question , Michael ?
Well , you know , I think I 'm --
The morning papers , because morning papers around the country and around the world are remaking their front page to include the Elizabeth Smart case , and we end with that tonight .
With her family on a day when their miracle finally came true .
She looks very , very healthy .
She 's grown a lot , and I 'm just so absolutely thrilled .
I could n't believe it .
In fact , I had to take a double take and pull her back away from me and say , `` is it really you ? ''
All of the children out there deserve to come home to their parents the way Elizabeth has come back to us , and I just hope and pray that Congress will quickly pass the Amber Alert so that those children will have a better chance because they cross the state line and they 're out of commission , and we need to have this here , we really do .
But I just am so grateful and so thankful .
Thank you very much .
Reporter :
Can you describe Elizabeth 's demeanor ?
You said she looked good , she was bigger , but she 's been through this horrible ordeal .
Is she still scared ?
She excited ?
Happy ?
I do n't know .
I mean , I 'm sure she was just thrilled to be back .
such happiness and such love .
And I just held her , held her the whole way home .
I just brought her little brother William in , and as William and she saw each other , it was such a wonderful reunion for them to just hug , and he would hug her and look at her and hug her and look at her , and could n't believe , I think , as a 4 - year - old now that his sister is home .
With the darkness that surrounds us in these times of the possibility of war that could be coming upon us and a miracle that has been brought to us , an incredible miracle that has been brought to our family , words can not express how grateful we are for the prayers around the world .
Do miracles still exist ?
And the answer is yes .
And we have Elizabeth back .
This neighborhood , the Federal Heights neighborhood , everybody 's been ripped up , everybody 's helped , everybody 's prayed to do whatever they can .
We thank God for all the searchers , for all the people .
In the history of the world I do n't think a little girl 's been prayed for more than Elizabeth Smart , and we thank you for answering those prayers .
Thank you .
It 's a nice day to have this job .
We 'll see you tomorrow , 10:00 Eastern time .

First of all , before we tell you about this story , we were going to , these are live pictures from Baghdad .
There 's been some activity in the last few moments .
Looks like tracer fire we 're looking at , anti-aircraft guns firing at what they sense is some sort of threat coming from the skies .
Baghdad has had sporadic episodes of this tonight .
No major explosions we 're aware of , but just , apparently , in the last few moments , there has been activity .
You can see it there just now .
We 've been reporting , the city has begun to see its electricity turned back on .
We do n't know that all of it is back , but at least some of it is .
We also know that 12 miles southwest of the city , coalition forces remain largely in control of what was formerly Saddam Hussein International Airport , now renamed by the coalition Baghdad International Airport , but the coalition is quick to point out that they do not have control of the area immediately surrounding the airport .
Again , these are live pictures of Baghdad , where it is well into the night .
We 're , of course , going to keep monitoring the situation there and bring you up to speed on anything we learn .
A week after these pictures surfaced , and after saying he 'd fight for his job , Larry Eustachy resigned as basketball coach at Iowa State .
The damage to his credibility was too much after Eustachy admitted he partied with students at rival schools , and that he 's an alcoholic .
He seeped a $ 960,000 buyout from the university .

There 's dancing in the streets of Belgrade as angry demonstrations have turned into celebrations .
Tens of thousands of people crowded the streets of the Yugoslavian capital today after the apparent overthrow of President Slobodan Milosevic .
Yesterday , protesters stormed key government buildings and seized Serb state television in Belgrade .
Russia has joined the West in its support of opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica .
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov congratulated Kostunica on his election victory .
He also gave him a letter from Russian President Vladimir Putin .
Putin says he hopes the opposition leader will do `` everything possible to overcome the internal political crisis '' in Yugoslavia .
Russia was the last European power to withhold support for the opposition .
The man who lost power in Yugoslavia finally surfaced today .
Slobodan Milosevic met with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov .
Ivanov says Milosevic told him he plans to remain in Serbia and continue to run its largest political party .
Indeed Milosevic still considers himself to be President , according to his brother Borislav .
In an interview with CNN , Borislav Milosevic accused Western nations of supporting the demonstrations and said his brother has no plans to leave the city .
Regardless of how many votes Mr. Kostunica received , the actions that took place last night are vandalism .
It 's violence .
It should n't have happened .
That 's not democracy .
The opposition did n't accept the ruling of the constitutional court and began to storm the parliament , which was not being defended , and inflicted huge material damage , but it also did more damage to our institutions .
The next step in the transition to a new government is for the Yugoslav parliament to convene .
A commission set up to ensure the transfer of power is attempting to call lawmakers to Belgrade for a special session .
Alessio Vinci reports that may not happen until tomorrow because some members of parliament will have to travel to Belgrade from Montenegro .
What is going on right now is intense negotiations with all the members of parliament that were elected on September trying to get the majority needed in order to swear in Vojislav Kostunica as the next President of Yugoslavia .
With the events of the past week in Yugoslavia , the world is getting to know the name of Vojislav Kostunica .
Jonathan Mann takes a look at the man and his politics .
Unlike President Milosevic , he was not a Communist in the long years when party membership was the key to power .
He was not among the prominent opposition figures who have struggled against each other almost as hard as the regime .
He is an orthodox Serb nationalist , but he supports truer democracy for his country and better relations with its neighbors and the West .
Kostunica is a soft - spoken and uncharismatic figure who spent years building the Democratic Party of Serbia and gathering only modest support .
After ten years , people know what are the differences between Milosevic 's policies and ours , what Milosevic was saying and promising and what the opposition parties and I myself was saying in these years and how I was behaving .
Kostunica is 56 , an expert on constitutional law who lives with his wife and pets in a Belgrade apartment .
He was fired from his job teaching law in 1974 for his opposition to the policies of the Tito government .
He refused an offer to return in 1989 because of his opposition to the Milosevic regime , and he rejects much from the West as well -- the Dayton peace accord , Western sanctions on Yugoslavia , and the war crimes tribunal .
In the months before the election , he was careful to distinguish between his support for European aid projects tied to reform and U.S. efforts , which he describes as unhelpful , even to the opposition .
I know what the support means when we get from European Union , the programs like energy for democracy , school for democracy .
Those small projects .
Here we get nothing in advance , just a political support which consists of nothing , and which is mostly used and abused and manipulated by the regime , saying they are just NATO parties , as is often said by regime , they are not having their own policy .

Venezuela 's leftist President has awarded Fidel Castro the key to the city of Caracas .
The Cuban President is on a five - day visit to Venezuela to sign an oil - supply deal .
Hundreds of Venezuelans lined the streets of the capital to welcome Castro .
Opposition legislators boycotted Castro 's speech in the Venezuelan Congress to protest human rights abuses in Cuba .
The United Nations Security Council has passed a resolution condemning what it calls `` acts of violence , especially the excessive use of force against Palestinians . ''
U.S. diplomats had opposed wording which apparently blamed the new round of clashes on an Israeli opposition leader 's visit to a shrine venerated by both sides .
The Security Council vote was unanimous , with the United States abstaining .
President Clinton is waiting for Israeli and Palestinian leaders to respond to his latest peace initiative .
He 's inviting both sides to Washington for separate meetings with him .
Aides say the President spoke by phone last night with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak , after talking earlier in the day with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat .
In Gaza , there is no end to the unrest .
The funeral of a Palestinian youth turned into a rally against Israel .
Chanting protesters vowed to avenge the death of the 16 - year - old , who was shot by Israel troops near the crossing between Gaza and Israel .
216 sailors from the `` USS Cole '' are back in their home port of Norfolk , Virginia .
Cheering family members greeted the crew with flowers and waving flags yesterday .
A few `` Cole '' crew members are staying with the ship .
It will begin its five - week trip home on the deck of the rescue ship `` Blue Marlin '' today .
17 crew members were killed and 39 injured in last month 's apparent terrorist bombing of the warship .
Hello , everyone .
I 'm Holly Firfer , sitting in for Judy Fortin .
Here 's our top story --
As Palestinians bury their dead , the violence in the streets of the Mideast continues , and Arab leaders begin a meeting in Cairo , trying to develop a unified position on the whole situation .
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak opened the emergency Arab League summit with a statement blaming Israel for adopting a belligerent attitude which threatens the essence of peace .
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat accused Israel of `` mass killing and barbarian bombing . ''
He called on the Arab leaders to take a stand `` befitting the sacrifices '' of the Palestinian people .
Our choice is the choice of permanent , comprehensive and just peace , and our aim is to liberate our land and to create our independent state in Palestinian blast land with Jerusalem as its capital and the return of our refugees to their homes .
While leaders and spokesmen for both sides talk , the fighting goes on .
Richard Blystone reports on the latest round of violence in the Mideast .
The studied words of the diplomats and the cries in the street seem to come from two different worlds .
Fresh clashes in the Gaza Strip on the Mediterranean coast and in the West Bank .
Fighting springs from the funerals for at least nine Palestinians killed Friday in some of the worst clashes in this three - week conflict .
A new intifada , successor to the four - year street campaign that ended with Palestinian / Israeli negotiations a decade ago , according to a leader of Yasser Arafat 's Fateh movement .
A counterview from Dan Meridor , chairman of Israel 's defense and foreign affairs committee .
When I hear the Palestinians saying on television we are at the war of independence of Palestine , I understand they prefer war to peace .
A stupid and difficult historic mistake , but we have to face it .
Overnight , a new development on Israel 's northern border .
The defense reports an attack at the border fence .
One body was found after Israelis responded with small arms , tanks and helicopters from Lebanon .

If nine caroling cats crooning Christmas classics does n't put you in the holiday mood , maybe nothing will .
Yes , it 's that time of year .
The Jingle Cats are back , and can be found just about anywhere .
They have cassettes and and their very own video , which is also out on DVD .
The man behind the music , creator Mike Spalla , says he owes it all to his cat , Cheesepuff , and her finely tuned vocal cords .
I was hired to do some Christmas music , and it was just `` Jingle Bells , '' and I brought my cat with me to the studio , and I was working on the song and the cat jumped up into the record booth and started meowing along , meowing to me .

Cheesepuff and friends first clawed their way onto the music charts in 1993 with the release of their `` meowy Christmas '' CD , featuring 20 classic Christmas hits .
It was such a success , the following year , the feline group released another holiday song collection , `` Here Comes Santa Claws . ''
Spalla says they have a following of some very unique fans .
There 's a certain kind of person that 's in tune with a cat .
They 're thoughtful .
They must be more intelligent or something .

The cats are such a hit , Spalla has taken on a couple of new groups .
`` Jingle Babies , '' and , of course , `` Jingle Dogs . ''

Former nightclub singer , television anchor and Arkansas State employee , Flowers ' allegations threatened to torpedo Clinton 's presidential chances .
Although Mr. Clinton denied having a relationship with Flowers , he did speak of bringing `` pain '' to his marriage during a joint television interview with his wife , Hillary .

She said she felt vindicated when he admitted under oath that he 'd had an affair with her after denying it for years .
Flowers has written two books , both of which are for sale on her website , along with private - label cigars and signed photos .
A federal judge recently dismissed a defamation lawsuit she brought against Hillary Rodham Clinton and two former presidential aides .

The recently concluded China - Africa Forum reminded many people of the Tanzania - Zambia Railway which China offered support in building in Africa .
However , people may not know that today another group of Chinese people in a foreign land are still evoking the same kind of touching story , treating the war wounds of battle - scarred Cambodia , and paving a road to prosperity .
The restoration project for Highway 7 from Kracheh , Cambodia , to the Cambodia - Laos border is China 's largest project aiding Cambodia to date .
It is being undertaken by China 's Shanghai Construction Group .
Previously on this 186 - kilometer road , the widest section was only four meters , while the narrowest was only 40 centimeters .
The road was bumpy and rough throughout , and there were landmines left from the chaos of war back then .
Since construction started on November 18 , 2004 , through the hard work of Chinese engineers , the width of all road sections has now been broadened to over seven meters .
The first layer of asphalt has been laid and pressed on most road sections , with all lanes expected to be open to traffic by July 2007 .
In order to turn this small path into a thoroughfare , the Chinese engineering personnel have overcome a series of difficulties .
A regiment of artillery corps from Guangzhou military region combined the characteristics of new equipment , and actively explored new ways to protect new equipment in an information battlefield environment , so as to improve the equipment and safeguard personnel , as well as to ensure their protection and combat abilities .
What you are seeing now is a regiment of artillery corps conducting its new equipment protective exercise in a simulated battlefield background ; through such exercises , eh , they are able to examine the protection capability of their troops ' equipment and safeguard personnel during times of war .
At the site of the military exercise , the reporter saw that when the front artillery equipment experienced problems , the basic support group of the regiment deployed along the rim quickly dispatched an artillery repair team , which then headed to the rocket artillery group and helped repair the damaged weaponry .
In order to enhance the support capacity of the new equipment , this regiment embarks on the requirement of an actual combat , enhancing trainings such as battlefield repair , equipment maintenance and repair under joint long - distance firepower , and other contents .
Altering from the previous sentinel - based protection mode , troops were sent to the field to conduct a completely new safeguard training in a mobile operation field , so as to train safeguard personnel in a simulated war environment and enhance their safeguard capabilities .
A regiment of the Second Artillery Corps , which has just passed the general staff 's operational capability assessment , conducted a new round of training impetus regarding their exposed weak links during the examination .
In the wake of the application for world natural and cultural heritage status for the Five Great Mountains , seven of our country 's biggest Danxia landform regions , including Guangdong 's Mt. Danxia and Hunan 's Mt. Lang , today once again jointly applied in bundle to the World Heritage Committee for world natural heritage status .
Danxia Landforms is the collective name for red sandrock that through long - term wind erosion has taken various and wonderful Danxia peaks .
The scenic areas participating in the joint application include Mt. Danxia in Guangdong , Mt. Lang in Hunan , Mt. Wanfo , Ziyuan County in Guangzi , Lake Dajin in Fujian , Mt. Longhu in Jiangxi and Fang Cliff in Zhejiang .
According to the joint application proposal , the collective name for the application to the World Heritage Committee is China 's Danxia Landforms .
The official document submitted was jointly compiled by the seven Danxia landform regions .
The cost involved in the application was also shouldered jointly by the seven applicants .
At the beginning of 2008 , the World Heritage Committee will conduct a comprehensive survey and assessment of scenic areas of heritage site applicants .
Eh , a current trend is that UNESCO , ah , and the World Heritage Center encourage each member country , uh , to make more joint or linked applications .
Because , uh , they also feel , uh , presently , uh , that sometimes single entities may result in too great of a number , so they hope that , eh , similar proposals like this can be joined together as much as possible .
In this way , eh , they can be , eh , made more representative .
Last year and this year , the U. N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention twice reached unanimity regarding the issue of Saddam 's trial .
The conclusion was that the forcible deprivation of Saddam 's liberty contravened the provisions of Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .
The covenant is a binding international treaty of which both the US and Iraq are signatory states .
The statements said that the opinion issued by the working group on September 1 of this year concretely set out many procedural shortcomings in Saddam 's trial .
These included the lack of independence and impartiality of the tribunal , the insufficient time and facilities Saddam had to prepare his defense , the restrictions on his right to access lawyers , also the restrictions on the possibilitly of defense lawyers in calling and interrogating witnesses , and so on .
This working group also emphasized that in issuing the statement it was not requesting the release of Saddam , but rather was recommending that Iraq and US , in accordance with the relevant international covenants , reexamine whether at the outset Saddam 's trial conformed to regulations .
Besides the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , these covenants also include the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .
The working group also called on the Iraqi government to refrain from carrying out the sentence of death by hanging on Saddam until it had reexamined the trial procedures .
Saddam is accused of carrying out a reprisal operation against local villagers and killing 143 people in the local area in 1982 after escaping an assassination in the village of Dujail .
On the 5th of this month , he was sentenced to death by hanging by the Iraqi High Tribunal .
Even though Saddam still has the right to appeal to the appellate court , once the sentence has been determined it must be carried out within thirty days .
Let us look at this picture first .
This picture , ah , was published on the front cover of Nature Magazine printed on the 14th .
The animals in this picture , uh , perhaps you may not be very familiar with .
It 's called Volaticotherium antiquus , Gu as in Gudai , and Xiang as in Fei Xiang .
It was discovered by five Chinese scientists regularly stationed in both China and the United States during an archaeological expedition at the end of last year .
Of course , this picture , uh , was also drawn based on the recovered portrait of the fossil .
The World Journal said that the meaning of the discovery of Volaticotherium antiquus is of great significance .
By now , the earliest known mammal gliders are bats , which had started to exist about 51 million years ago .
But Volaticotherium antiquus , uh , may have lived between 130 million to 160 million years ago , during the same time period as the dinosaurs .
Its discovery , ah , pushed the origins of mammal gliders back at least 80 million years .
George is an eight - year - old boy who lives in Tbilisi , the capital of Georgia .
On the day of November 23 , his supporters gathered in the city .
This day he tried to push a truck with his bare hands at the age of eight to break a Guinness World Record .
George looks somewhat older than his real age .
The simple reason is that his physique appears stronger than other children of the same age .
At eight years old , he already weighs 93 kilograms and is 150 centimeters tall .
Little George 's parents and relatives encourage him to take advantage of the gifts which he naturally possesses to make himself a famous person .
He easily challenged the 43 - meter distance and broke the Guinness World Record .
This achievement made his father very happy .
He said , I 'm very happy that my child has broken the Guinness World Record .
I 'm overjoyed .
Today is St. George 's Day .
My son George broke the Guinness world record on this day .
St. George is a faction from the Eastern Orthodox Church .
The Guinness World Record committee were looking for a volunteer to sign up to participate in the 500 kilograms challenge at first .
George prepared to break the record under his father 's guidance .
When he had gotten everything ready , the truck had already been loaded to 2,100 kilograms .
This was enough to break the record .
The doctor who had been looking after George since he was small until he grew up said that although his body size was bigger and he was stronger than normal , overall he was very healthy .
The nation 's highest court will take up the case next week .
That development may not be as significant as it seems .
Joining me now is law professor Rick Pildes , a consultant to NBC News .
Could a decision from the U.S. Supreme Court settle this case once and for all ?
At this stage , any decision from the U.S. Supreme Court is almost certainly not going to provide a final resolution of this election dispute .
Indeed , the issue is so narrow now before the Supreme Court that whichever way the court rules , it will likely have only the most marginal impact on what 's going on in Florida .
Even if the Bush campaign prevails before the Supreme Court , it simply means we will move more quickly into the contest phase of the litigation or the next stage of the litigation .
But you believe the fact that the U.S. Supreme Court just decided to hear this case is a partial victory for both Bush and Gore .
It is a partial victory for both sides .
For the last two weeks , the central constitutional argument the Bush campaign has been making to the federal courts is , stop these manual recounts now , they violate the Constitution .
The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear that part of the case , agreeing with all the other federal judges who have unanimously held that this is not the proper time for federal court intervention .
So in that sense , a victory for the Gore campaign .
For the Bush campaign , a victory in the willingness of the Supreme Court to play some role in overseeing the Florida system and the Florida judicial decision making process .
Whatever the Supreme Court decides this time , you say this case could come back before the U.S. Supreme Court again ?
John , if the Supreme Court of the United States is to play a final and decisive role in this dispute , that role is going to come at the end of the Florida judicial process , not at this stage .
Law professor Rick Pildes , thank you .
The `` USS Cole '' is on its long journey home tonight , sitting atop a rescue ship , and now , for the first time , its open wound fully visible .
NBC 's Jim Miklaszewski tonight at the Pentagon with an exclusive report on the damage done and the difficulty in finding those responsible .
Jim ?
What 's the latest there ?
New pictures reveal the sheer power of that terrorist bomb that ripped through the `` USS Cole . ''
For the first time , with the `` Cole '' out of the water , the full impact of the catastrophic blast clearly visible .
In these photos obtained by NBC News , the damage much larger than first imagined , extending well below the water line .
Workers on deck dwarfed by the 40 x 60 - foot gaping wound .
Large sections of the hull buckled inward .
Crewman Sean Powell , back home in Florida , says inside the `` Cole , '' it was chaos , it got dark , we lost power , ship started to list , that 's what scared everybody .
Despite the devastating damage , Navy officials predict the `` Cole '' can be repaired for about $ 150 million , and put back into service .
Justice Department officials say in Yemen , the FBI 's investigation is dead in the water .
Senior U.S. officials tell NBC News the Yemen government has all but shut down all cooperation in finding those behind the `` Cole '' attack .
Evidence is either withheld or tampered with .
A surveillance video of the harbor at the time of the attack was so heavily edited , it did n't even show the blast itself .
Why ?
Yemen is a terrorist hotbed , and some members of President Saleh 's own cabinet have direct ties to radical Islamic extremists and terrorists .
It 's hard to see exactly why it is that the President there would ever want to cooperate with the United States and possibly put himself in jeopardy .
Reporter :
And even though cooperation from Yemen is at a standstill , U.S. officials tell NBC News that they are making substantial progress in the investigation and are fully confident they will get enough evidence to retaliate against those responsible .
Tom ?
Thanks very much , NBC 's Jim Miklaszewski tonight .
In the waters off the coast of Yemen , two urgent missions tonight collecting evidence from the suicide bombing and retrieving bodies still buried in debris .
316 were aboard the `` USS Cole '' when the terrorists struck .
Dozens were injured .
17 were killed .
Our coverage begins with NBC 's Joe Johns .
A plane carrying the bodies of five dead American sailors from the `` USS Cole '' arrived today at Dover Air Force Base , as the first wave of forensics experts and investigators from the Department of Defense and the FBI arrived in Yemen .
Their mission -- to continue the search for evidence and suspects in the explosion .
Also on the way , equipment to lift the `` Cole '' out of the water and specialists to help retrieve the bodies of those trapped and presumed dead .
We know there are spaces that are inaccessible .
We know there are some remains in those spaces .
We need to get in those and locate the remains that we anticipate finding there .
Though the work was only beginning , a top Justice Department official in Washington predicted the outcome of the investigation .
I 'm confident that we will be able to determine who was behind the bombing and that those people , those organizations , will be held accountable , they will be punished .
This critical phase of the investigation must be conducted both above and beneath the water on a tight time line .
They 'll want to get in there quickly because one of the problems when you 're dealing with seawater is that it will have an adverse effect on your evidence .
To further speed up the process , the FBI has now activated the Strategic Information and Operation Center in Washington , conceived after the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania , ensuring the fastest possible exchange of information between investigators and the decision makers .
On the diplomatic front , the U.S. said the government of Yemen is cooperating with the investigation , though that country 's President disputes charges that his nation is a haven for terrorists .
The Justice Department says no group or individual has been ruled out as a suspect , though many expect that whoever gets the blame will eventually be tied to the terrorist Osama bin Laden .
And the grieving continued today at the Naval Academy 's football game against Notre Dame .
A moment of silence to remember the victims of this terrorist act .
