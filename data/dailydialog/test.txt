maybe you should start seeing someone else .
maybe youre right .

that  s a good idea . it must be easy to find a job in shanghai .
that  s a good idea . what should i do if i am in two minds about a topic ?
that  s all right . we  ll teach you .
that  s all right .
that  s certainly true . but , that  s what this job is all about , maria . theres no doubt that this project is unacceptable .
that  s correct .
that  s easy . express possibilities . people will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle .
that  s fine . please call again later .
that  s for sure . you  re new , too , huh ?
that  s great  i can have two bags checked for  NUM pounds each . i think i  m all set . you  re really efficient . thank you very much for your help .

that  s not going to be all right .
that  s not true . dark angel is a good show .
that  s ok . what are the weight restrictions for checked baggage ?
that  s right . plus , i agree with his policies .
that  s right . you need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about  NUM to  NUM minutes .
that  s too bad .
that  s unless there is a traffic jam . it could take three hours .
that  s very important . a friend recommended a good law firm to me . we  ll need someone to hire staff .
that bad egg , who took the low road since he was a boy .
that cant be true . i remember the number clearly . is your number  NUM ?
that depends . we offer membership for one month , half a year and one year .
that does sound pretty good .
that dress is very pretty . why don  t you like it ?
that happens . without close quality examination , we may encounter fraud , and the eshop may suddenly disappear .
that is  NUM ?
that is awesome . congratulation  i know you can make it .
that is great.do you have to work the night shift ?
that is kind of weird  what if she is a psycho or something like that ?
that is right up my alley . you say party and im there .
that is the pump you are in front of .
that looks graceful on you .
that may be true , but when a woman gets pregnant , it changes her life completely . men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand .
that means it will get hotter .
that means that you talk to them ? in which language ?
that might be the artificial lighting , madam . of course , if you could come back in daylight , you might find it  s exactly what you are looking for .
that must have been just before i got the speeding ticket .
that price is perfectly acceptable .
that proves my point  protect yourself or youll get burned .
that should  ve been something you knew already .

that sounds bad  im really worried , what should i do ? maybe i should go home and stay in the rest of the day .

that sounds like a good idea .
that sounds nice .
that still leaves a gap of  NUM dollars . lets meet each other halfaway again and split the difference  i think this is a price we can both be satisfied with .
that sucks .
that sucks so much . what are we going to do ?
that too .
that will do . what an interesting picture  how old is it ?
that will probably cost you around twelve hundred dollars a month .
that would be great  is it expensive ?
that would be great . what kind of music would you like , a band or recorded music ?

thats all right . but could you tell me how often and how many hours i should work overtime ?
thats all the general information of our company . i think you already have good knowledge about our company .
thats all there is .
thats basically it .
thats basically what i eat .
thats because americans love sitcoms .
thats because i just took one step inside and turned right around . that bathroom is too gross for me .
thats because the fashion , taste and social customs and so on vary considerably .
thats cheap .
thats coincident
thats crossing the line .
thats easy . it was invented by edison .

thats excellent . how have you managed that ?
thats fine . by the way , please have that suit dry cleaned .
thats fine . what about operating the fax and duplicator ?
thats fine with me . how much time are we going to have to work on this ?
thats for the phone calls you made from your room .
thats good to hear .
thats great . can i book the room ?
thats great . its most thoughtful of you to do this , miss rose .

thats not the way to solve the problem . did you look in the classified advertisements column ?
thats ok . ill wait until youre finished . just out of curiosity , do you have a subscription for that magadize ?
thats ok .
thats over on callaway street , isnt it ?
thats pretty cool .
thats pretty easy to explain . with the deposit , the interest is fixed , but the dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year . the longer the term , the higher the dividend you earn . this is because it is calculated at the compound interest rate .
thats putting it mildly . my father started shouting at my sister and my mother just glared at her .
thats quite expensive . who is their target audience ?
thats really a good idea . taking a walk on the beach and lying in the sun are pretty good . i recommend you qingdao or dalian .
thats really exciting . how many months are you pregnant ?
thats right , no one else has a product on the market now that is comparable .
thats right . a german company has invited me for business talks .
thats right . i can see them in my dreams .
thats right . just a simple multivitamin that i can take every day .
thats right . seeing is believing .
thats right . you know , pink , green and black could also be good for you . actually , i think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion . its just that different colors can give people different impressions . for example , black could make you look mature , while pink could make you look young and energetic .
thats right .
thats simple . just click the hyperlink , www.taobao.com or www . ebay.com , and you can see the specimen of the goods shown on the screen , and then you can place an order online with the sales company . and the goods will be delivered to your place .
thats so disappointing . i dont know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .
thats so great
