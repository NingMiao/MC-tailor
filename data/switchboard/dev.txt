favorite type of music or musician or any
i don ' t really have a favorite type i like a lot of different types of music
do you
yeah i have a tape collection that i like to listen to cassette tapes but it ' s pretty varied yeah how about you
uh - huh
uh - huh
oh i i ' m very i ' m very varied as well i
ever met a type of music i don ' t like except for maybe you know heavy metal and that
that ' s exactly me the acid rock or the heavy metal even some of that i like okay but not mostly as a general rule i don ' t care for that at all
yeah
yeah
well as far as the rap goes i think there are a few artists that appeal to me
uh - huh
themselves and i like some of their songs but as i agree as a general rule i wouldn ' t choose rap either
huh
oh
um - hum
um - hum
um - hum
i like i said pretty varied music i have a couple that my husband really hates when i listen to them
uh - huh
like billy holiday i really love to listen to her and i even have a tape of lady smith blackman bazo
oh gosh
uh - huh yeah sure
so they ' re interesting to listen to you might try that how about you
oh yeah
my two listening enjoyments are but you know jazz can get on my nerves after a while you can ' t just listen to it you know to
especially a lot of the deeper stuff you just can ' t listen to it for enjoyment unless you ' re
it it ' s too you have to concentrate on it seems
what about the blues or something like that
blues are okay i tell you i do like i grew up on blue grass music my dad is a big blue grass fan and so
uh - huh
no it doesn ' t it doesn ' t
yeah
uh - huh
uh - huh yeah i yeah i grew up on him
uh - huh
uh - huh
sure
uh - huh
sons of the pioneers you know stuff like that
uh - huh yeah
oh do you
yeah you sure do
um - hum
yeah
um - hum
i have some spiro gyro tapes
oh they ' re great aren ' t they
yeah
yeah it sure is yeah
al jarreau he ' s somebody i like he ' s pretty kind of jazz inspired but still kind of pop too
uh - huh
yeah i like his he has a nice smooth voice
oh yeah and you know what i like the most about him is i ' ve gone to see him in concert and he always he looks like he ' s having fun
yeah sure
i mean some people sing and they have their faces all contorted like it hurts them or something
but he looks like he ' s having a good time i mean he ' s up there moving around and smiling like he ' s happy and like all he wants to do is make the audience enjoy it too
uh - huh
sure
and he he ' s real fun to listen to
uh - huh
bonnie rait i like her a lot in fact when ever she won her big grammy i think there was like five of them or something was it five or
um - hum
um - hum
uh - huh
yeah something like that it was last year wasn ' t it
do you have a family budget or how do you work your budgeting
my wife and i did have a budget we were both working at the time and so forth
and
that we had to do that until we finally got the house paid for and other big bills taken care of
we have a budget but not as strict now as we used to because we don ' t have quite such a tight financial situation
um - hum
yeah
so it it ' s been helpful i mean yes having a budget is very important and that did get us so that you know the house is paid for and other major things were taken care of
and now we can relax a little bit more because basically we don ' t really require as much on a daily or a monthly basis as we did before so we ' re we don ' t have to have quite as strict a budget as we did
oh well we don ' t have a real strict budget
we have a low budget to work on but we you know for like groceries we saved up this much per week and then we just spend about so much we don ' t
sure uh - huh
i don ' t know of a written figure of expenses that we you know keep to or anything but i know that when i go to the grocery store that we always stick within you know five dollars between here and there
a certain amount
i think i ' ve i do that automatically myself i mean i unconsciously
yeah
you know stay in a within a with a certain amount because i have enough food already stored here that i don ' t have to make any large purchase at any one time all i normally do now is pick up little things here and there
oh
as the salt goes out or we need sugar or something like that
wow that ' s great
and we freeze a lot of that so a lot of the vegetables are taken care of in our own personal storage
oh
hm
we put it up the other person might not know about it
yeah well that ' s a good idea
let ' s see the other thing there the topic was talking about was
if you if i don ' t all i can think of is if you don ' t keep a real tight budget how do you control expenses but
uh - huh
huh oh yeah
and you know we could go to both places without having to spend so much for plane fare
yeah
and so
entertainment things like that then
somewhere in out in the wash it ' ll come out that we have enough to get back there you know
uh - huh that ' s right
we are going to be traveling to europe with a choral we sing with this so called pennsylvania choral and we make a two weeks
uh - huh
tour of foreign countries and of course that costs money
so we each of us watches the funds that we spend and make sure that we gather together over a period a time enough money to make this trip
so that is another way of budgeting
uh - huh that ' s right
and i think we just sort of unconsciously do it we just live a normal life but we don ' t throw any money away particularly we save it for this trip which is always very nice
uh - huh
but yeah
well let ' s face it then when we talking budget
level of my checking account and i have a money market account also
uh - huh
yeah so what are your favorite tv shows
one that i can ' t find anymore which is gabriel ' s fire
oh i haven ' t watched that very much is that do you like that
yes
when was that on
it was usually on thursday nights
on abc
oh yeah well
it may be that it was recently replaced
by actually by what may be my favorite tv show of because sort of twin peaks
it was same time period yes
yeah so twin peaks what happened was
i think twin peaks went off
they moved to a saturday night for a while and then put and then put something i guess gabriel ' s fire on it and at thursday nights and then they moved
no gabriel ' s fire was on cbs i think i take that back
i ' m not sure but anyway they moved it back and forth and that ' s when peaks was back in that time slot as well
so i don ' t know
you don ' t know what happened to gabriel ' s fire then
no i have no idea
i don ' t think
i don ' t think that was on abc anyway i don ' t know what happened to it though
i don ' t remember one from one station to another i keep forgetting one station
what ' s your second favorite
i ' m sort of a very big twin peaks fan and beyond that i just sort of watch anything that happens to be on i ' m
half the time i ' m a tv addict and the other half the time i just ignore it
it ' s really bad yeah there ' s some new shows that i sort of like
have you seen this shannon steel show or
it ' s about a lawyer it ' s one of these lawyer shows you know they seem to be popular these days
and then there ' s just a lot of those sort of blair shows floating around
oh is he the reformed gambler yes
yes
i ' ve noticed that every major station now has their own law show there ' s la law and there ' s equal justice
some other one law and order or something
lots of lots of these things that are floating around now they seem to be popular shows do you like the law shows or
i really don ' t watch that much tv what i do is i tape the programs i want to watch and then on the nights i can watch i ' ll pick out something
but
that makes logical sense also saves a lot of time with commercials
oh i have i ' ve i watched that late i guess it ' s on late saturday nights or something that ' s on during the day as well
midnight
midnight
have you have you seen this often
i tape it
oh really
yeah i tape it because i don ' t stay up that late to watch it i tape it
yeah
but i understand that in england they play it at normal times because they don ' t consider that violent
and the reason they have it on here so late is because they consider it a violent program
really
i don ' t know that
and
i ' m like i don ' t believe this
i
that don ' t it seems like i mean if wrestling is prime time
professional wrestling it seems like it ' s just
just like pros in a wrestling to me i don ' t i don ' t see any difference though
i don ' t either
i don ' t understand it they consider it violent i have so ever i have seen it on
where we are i live in rochester new york
and i think a
you ' re in new york
yes
oh
where are you
i ' m in dallas texas
you ' re everybody i speak to is in texas oh
oh yeah but i ' m in new york
and we seem we seem to have i think the american gladiators is on
sunday afternoons actually around here
oh really
as well sometimes
i think it ' s been on i think i ' ve seen it during the day
i know i ' ve seen it during the day in florida
when i was at my parents down there
oh
definitely seen it on during the day down there and i don ' t think it ' s a very violent show i think it ' s funny
i think it ' s a real good concept i think it ' s something completely new
i think it ' s great i love watching a microbiologist
fighting off with a policemen or something else and competition
i ' m going oh great you know
well
it ' s a it ' s a great role model for everybody
yeah i think so i think because people sort of get through you know
i think that people sort of learn the importance of sort of physical
fitness as well as the
as well as you know some mental fitness and i think that people sort of learn good sportsmanship and so forth
oh yes i mean when i had i was watching it the first time i ever saw a microbiologist on there i thought well it just goes to prove it has nothing to do with your physical capabilities
and there she was terrific she was really terrific
well don ' t they take people who have some sort of
big abilities like and at least they used to when it when it the first ones i saw they had a man on who was he played college football and almost went pro and they had a
a woman who was a black belt in karate and she was the she was in the junior olympics or something or they seem to have people who have very big sports backgrounds to have they leaned away from that sort of
they hold competitions in los angeles in florida and minneapolis
trying to think of i think it ' s in four places around the united states they hold competition and the only requirement
is of course your skill of passing these tests
oh that ' s how they do it
and that ' s it
and
we had a bar man from here in dallas area that made it there is a woman that made
really
well she called herself a craft person so i ' m not quite sure what she made
and she made it i mean there is no your occupation has nothing to do with it
yeah okay i just thought they had some
strictly your skill
yeah i thought they had some sort of i mean i thought they were just poor people like us i guess not that ' s great
huh - uh
but maybe i ' ll try it one day
i will get on it one day and see if i can
what do they win they win money i think don ' t they
i think the last i heard was it ' s up to about a hundred fifty thousand dollars
really
uh - huh
wow all that for getting tennis balls shot at you at a hundred miles an hour
yeah that ' s you know just minor
just minor little ball here or there you know
one little ball here and there yeah and this guy ' s beating you up
so i don ' t mind the beating up part i actually feel the tennis balls would hurt
oh well they come out with a lot of bruises too
they look like
yeah they seem like a tennis ball but there also doesn ' t look like
it ' s almost livable
yeah but best it i don ' t think i could i could handle those tennis balls
so what else to you tape besides american at there anything else
hey
huh
see i tape murder she wrote
okay
i like mysteries
oh okay
i like mysteries
i tape father dowling
uh - huh
because that ' s another mystery
and i don ' t have to concentrate too hard on them
but i ' m sure that ' s fun
most of the lawyer programs like law and order
uh - huh
they ' re not on the times that i ' ve got
that i ' ve watched because i haven ' t had t got tv guide around here in ages
oh okay well they seem to be on later all always right before the news is when i catch them
yeah
i tend to if nothing else i tend to turn on the television at eleven o ' clock just to watch the news
and or nightline or something
just sort of get a good you know
a good a good think for the day
your news is on at eleven
yes
when is yours on
ten i was just in the middle of watching it
oh gosh well i ' m sorry i interrupted
oh that ' s okay no problem
yeah ours is on actually it ours is on at eleven it it ' s eleven o ' clock now here or eleven twenty five now here in new york i think they do that i think they put things on at
eleven o ' clock here and i think they put it like eleven o ' clock
california time like in california but in the middle they sort of like central time or mountain time they push things back
so i was actually i ' m not sure i was in i was in iowa awhile ago and noticed that everything was an hour earlier
so does your prime time start at seven o ' clock
no well they have it at six and they have it at nine
wait no not even the news but do they have like
and they have one at ten
do like sort of all the regular sitcoms and so forth start at seven o ' clock
you so like you know the regular television shows that are that are very popular do they start at seven or at eight
i ' m trying to think
both let ' s see they start evening shade at
seven and then it goes to
what is it after evening
right because that would actually start at eight o ' clock here
that ' s major dad at eight i think it is
yeah that would all start at
that would all start at
eight o ' clock here that wouldn ' t start at seven
we have at seven o ' clock we just have
the they ' ll play you know they have old reruns of cheers or something
from seven to seven thirty and then something else from seven thirty to eight but then at
at eight o ' clock is when everything starts
huh
which is
which is strange i mean because yours start at seven and end at ten and ours start at
yeah it ' s stopped around here at ten and it goes into night programs
at that point which could be one of you know many different night programs but it goes into night programs
but do you ever watch cheers
oh that ' s great
oh all the time
do you watch cheers or
oh yeah oh yeah
okay
okay we ' re talking about houses and if they ' re typical for the area
is yours
well i don ' t live in a house i live in a duplex
it ' s typical for the area i would say uh - huh
is it is it brick or
it ' s stone and wood it ' s a combination
okay
which is very typical for austin
yeah our neighborhood everything is a little bit different
oh
i mean you they ' re all custom built homes and used in just about every other one is a different builder so every one has its own unique design and characteristics
well when you talk about that this is a really
i lost my house because i divorced and couldn ' t make the payments and long sad typical divorce story and
um - hum
i found a very nice area usually when you ' re talking rental property and duplexes you ' re not in with nicer homes
um - hum
but there are beautiful homes in the area and they are it ' s not like tract housing at all not a it it ' s a i don ' t know if you ' re familiar with where northwest hills is in austin but that ' s where i am
that ' s good
northwest hills
um - hum
no i ' m not really familiar with the area i ' m i come to austin very seldom
just to visit your sister
that ' s about it
so and i couldn ' t even tell you where she lives i know she lives off congress somewhere
oh okay
but
are the homes in your area what square footage are they
between twenty four and thirty one
okay
and
most of them are probably ninety percent brick
and whatever little bit of wood trim and everything else
um - hum
so even up to on the second story the brick goes all the way up there ' s not much siding
well that is really nice i like that and the maintenance is low and it always looks good
yeah
yeah we have a two story and it ' s
i can ' t we don ' t have i don ' t think we have more than maybe just on one side there ' s just a little bit of siding but i mean it ' s very little
um - hum what about the thing that i noticed and liked very much and hadn ' t seen at all from the twin cities
in texas it ' s so common to have one of those pretty wooden front doors with the iron you know the pretty window in it
stained glass
not stained glass but you know i don ' t know what bevelled glass right or frosted is that common in your area
or frosted yeah uh - huh
yeah in fact ours we have stained glass in ours
oh
and quite a few of them on our street have what they call a frosted glass which is kind of like a bevelled etched glass
um - hum that ' s what more typical around here
yeah so yeah it ' s kind of a mixture and then we have some that are just solid wood with just a just a regular normal small window in the middle of it
um - hum
so there ' s a variety there
that it sounds like you ' re in a very pretty area
it it ' s very nice we we ' re real proud we of course we ' ve waited a lot of years for it
uh - huh
we have made several moves and been able to appreciate the equity
um - hum
to have to step down a little bit and then kind of build your way back up
right do you work for ti
no i don ' t
i don ' t either i had been working there and i left ti to see if i could find something that would pay me a little better
and that was in january and so far it hasn ' t proved to work out that way
well
i guess i ' m not one to go back it ' s maybe make another step or another direction i know the day i left it was real funny one of my past bosses
looked at me and said when i told him good - bye and i was just talking to someone seeing whether or not i couldn ' t hire you back
oh
well of course that ' s the best way to do it
absolutely
don ' t burn any bridges
well i you know i hope that you can get back into something that you want
well thanks so much what do you do
i ' m an engineer
um - hum
with a defense industry
oh okay
and
i
oh i understand where that ' s where i was from
i ' m terrible at staying on the on the subject so if you want me to stay on it i ' ll try
you know we ' ve of course we have a daughter that ' s six and we and we would like to stay in this house until she gets out of high school at least
that ' s why i ' m struggling so much to
i ' m paying terrible rent in this duplex i can ' t buy in the area
but it i ' m trying to keep my daughters in the schools they were in and so far i ' m managing it so that ' s it means a lot yeah
oh yeah and you can also a lot of times you know like in even and not in and necessarily in this neighborhood but in neighborhoods close by here there ' s a lot of people who have left that or had to leave it
me
um - hum
and they became hudd foreclosures
right
and people are picking those up for very little so maybe you could luck into something like that and get a real nice house that way
well we ' re definitely checking out our options to get back to your how many people how many houses in your area have pools
oh and do you have one
no i don ' t want one i ' ve had one before
and it ' s just a lot of upkeep
that ' s
and you spend a lot of time with them and then and there is there is quite a bit of cost involved
well i understand that just to keep the filters running keep it clean keep it warm or cool or whatever right
chemicals water it and if you have it i had mine heated so the electricity well not the electricity but the gas and electricity because you do have both
um - hum
was pretty high and i just i just don ' t want to go through that anymore
you don ' t you don ' t really tend to use it as much as you anticipate you will either
no you ' re right
i can imagine
and then and it also had the sign on it with a swimming pool so me being the eternal optimist that i am i ' m going to work saying okay i ' ve got the number i know it ' s going to rent for a lot more than what i ' m used to paying but
you know with the pool and the extra bedroom it was going to be so nice maybe i can do it
so i called and found out how much it costs to rent this place per month and i could not believe it nineteen hundred dollars
um - hum
oh i know
i could not believe it
well i mean it especially in this neighborhood you know of course you can tell there there ' s about three different major jumps
um - hum
they start here they start at about one fifty and go up to about five hundred
and you can you can and you may have one next to you that ' s four hundred and the other one you know down the other street will be you know one fifty
are they intermixed very well or does it seem to be streets that are
well actually they ' re pretty much just spaced here and there which makes it nice because you get to you get to share some of the appreciation of everybody else ' s property value
exactly
and like the guy just next door to us he ' s probably got the same square footage but he paid he paid about a hundred thousand more than we did
wow
but you ought to see his pool he paid forty five thousand dollars just for his pool
oh my goodness
and it ' s got little fountains and all kinds of stuff
and of course i spent all my i spent most of the extra money that we had i spent it in you know we put curtains and all this stuff in and then we put the landscaping did the landscaping so that there ' s minimal you know upkeep in the yard
yes
because i travel a lot and i and i don ' t have time
oh that is
that ' s great planning
and i you know have some deck in the back
and you know we have like a it ' s not like a it ' s not really a gazebo but it ' s kind of like a little area out there where the where we have some you know table and chairs and stuff like that
oh that sounds nice
and there ' s just very little to mow very little upkeep you have to pull weeds out of the flower beds occasionally but what i sorry
is your
no go ahead
no i was going to say when i designed this house i designed it myself
and i took a lot of time to plan out everything i like you know where my stereo where the tv so i have built in cabinets and you know big covered patio big game room big living area big dining room
um - hum
is probably the size of a small bedroom
oh that ' s kind of what i left it ' s not quite as wasn ' t quite as big as that but it was wonderful
there ' s a sound like a panel topic we ' re talking about what we can do to make
short long - term goals to be able to get
a better value
out of what we already pay
uh - huh
and i wanted to say something to you about ross perot are you familiar with the man
yeah but he does raise some interesting points like
he does i from just his speaking i hear a strong tinge of integrity
uh - huh the
the question he raised in my mind was he was speaking in front of the national press club the other day
uh - huh
uh - huh
for a year
um - hum
not enough money
only half as much as we need
um - hum
so another words
four hundred billion dollars is hell of a lot of money
right
and that ' s just he deficit just this year
um - hum
there ' s apparently a hundred and eighty billion dollars that the president ' s own controller will tell you is fault and mismanagement
um - hum
i think that would be the short - term goals
um - hum
get rid of the fraud and mismanagement
um - hum
apparently they have plenty of time
the boards right now for computer systems and other tracking methods to get rid of the fraud and everyone says well it ' s going to cost a billion dollars to implement this well a billion stacked against a hundred and eighty billion sounds like a good investment to me
but are we what do you think are we talking about
the
the mechanical element you might say or are we talking about the human element i think it ' s the human element
it ' s a human element but the mechanical element of it can i mean mechanical meaning a computer could help
exactly yes
could help track
oh sure
and find out what ' s going on you know statistical cross - referencing and you know the pork barrel and all that other stuff that they you know
um - hum
they do to keep in office to stay in office
i think term limitations are a viable a viable way to cut the amount of money we spend in government
um - hum
if you know we say the president can be limited to two terms and we don ' t limit
um - hum
um - hum
congress critters at all
i think dave i think one of the
another thing is that we have such a great disparity between the consumer and the businesses and that all reflects into the budget also
uh - huh
we
we the american people don ' t have faith in the government and they don ' t have faith in business
yeah especially now after this rubber gate thing you know they it ' s something that everyone can identify with and
exactly
and if they can ' t even balance their own check book how in the worlds are they going to balance a trillion plus dollar budget
well then you have you have president bush going over to japan to try to do some wrangling over there to for the trade deficit and they send the send the top executive from gm
and they ' re making
four and five times they ' re making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year
oh that
gm is trying to market their products and is
that ' s another way is that the consumers just don ' t trust big business they just don ' t there ' s
so right there you have an element of the political government you have an element of big business and you have the consumer watching and they ' re just going what ' s this
um - hum
yeah i think it ' s
i ' ve been studying some libertarian views
uh - huh
and i ' ve been thinking more and more that maybe we need to get government out of
out of business and away from business and out of everybody ' s hair
you know i agree with you to a certain extent but the problem is with you know our capitalistic government
um - hum
the almighty dollar doesn ' t have any ethical code with it
um - hum
and i it ' s just like how you know what would you do the exxon valdez
you see what are we just say are we taking government out of it we need those controls because
the in the our capitalistic society it ' s just those controls it ' s just it ' s
did you watch the bulls this morning
you know what i watched a little bit of the bulls game and i had to leave in fact i think the bulls were ahead when i when i left who won the game
is that right
looked they looked like they were closing it out and then detroit kept coming back and isaiah missed a three point attempt at the end and i think the bulls won by two
uh - huh
yeah
wow
yeah they looked real good and
right
yeah well they they ' re balancing their attack and i think they look like
they ' ll repeat although here in the bay area people are real impressed with what don nelson ' s done with the warriors
i saw the second half of the game last night and they were impressive
they look good
billy owens looks like he was that was a good move for the warriors to trade for him
yeah now i don ' t i haven ' t kept up with what was going on with the
well they traded away
mitch richmond or is it tim hardaway one of the two
who along with chris mullin was you know though three were three of the best in the nba and they made a heck of a threesome and they traded either richmond or hardaway to sacramento for billy owens and
uh - huh
good move
yeah oh yeah he ' s really worked out well they ' ve got the warriors have got a team and
i think that ' ll be real interesting to see what they can do they ' re ahead and the lakers are down i guess in fourth position in the west and i don ' t know in the east i don ' t know is it boston in first place
yeah
i think boston ' s in first
boy they ' ve had a hard time they said they ' ve lost a lot of squeakers
yeah
how do people in texas deal with dallas houston and san antonio do you for example like san antonio in dallas
so there isn ' t much crossover huh
yeah
yeah it ' s true because san antonio isn ' t that close to you are they
no
is it
yeah so it ' s not something you ' d drive
yeah i was thinking maybe david robinson made a bit of a difference with kids and that sort of thing
yeah that always makes a big difference so
yeah i mean that ' s i think the way it i think that ' s the way it works now in basketball you know magic was a franchise for the lakers and you know bird for the for the celtics and
yeah
and you know you know i used to think that one player really doesn ' t make the club
but it really does you know you get somebody like magic and you can see the decline of that team
well it it ' s steve
well yeah i
let ' s see how about
let ' s see about ten years ago
what do you think was different ten years ago from now
well i would say as far as social changes go
i think families were more together they did more things together they ate dinner at the table together
um - hum
the parents usually took out time you know more time than they do now to come with the children and just spend the day doing a family activity
uh - huh
although i ' m not a mother i still think that a lot has changed since ten years ago
what do you think about that
what do you well
actually ten years from today seems rather short
yeah
but i do agree that generally it ' s
society has sort of
let ' s see rushed everything ahead
um - hum
and
i don ' t know it leaves a lot of time out for family and things like that in other words they just prioritize their lives differently
but i think that has a lot to do with economic situations
yes what about like as far as social changes in the individual
do you think that the individual has as much time as they did let ' s say ten twenty years ago
hm it depends
it ' s hard to say because i think
people were busy ten twenty years ago too
um - hum
i just
well how old are you
i ' m twenty eight
twenty eight okay i ' m twenty three
yeah
so there ' s maybe a five year gap between us
yeah
so
i just i think that things were a bit were have been busy all along it ' s just a matter where priorities are at placed
huh
yes
and that usually as far as families are concerned there used to be just one person working and usually the other parent was home
um - hum
and now it ' s pretty much an economic necessity of for most in most places for both parents to work
do you think it ' s an economic necessity or do you think that we ' re all trying to keep up with a certain standard of living
i think that ' s part of it too but i do think
i mean do you think people really need two cars and
no i don ' t
a house in the suburbs or
no i don ' t think that but then there are a lot of people that don ' t have that
um - hum
that
that really do need to work
um - hum
i think maybe those people that really do need to work both parents
yeah
um - hum
okay
um - hum
it ' s less those people that have the two cars and everything than it is the group that is just trying to survive
you so you think it ' s
which group are you saying is the one trying
i ' m saying that the group that is just trying to survive from day to day where both parents are working
um - hum
is more of the majority than the than the people that have the higher standard of living
because if you look at economics across this country and statistics on who has the money and who
the decreasing
middle class in this country
um - hum
i think that that ' s in my opinion the case
okay
so
i mean i have met people that
that just want to maintain a the standard of living and those that really need the job
okay and then sometimes i often find that
so
um - hum
you know a special a dishwasher a refrigerator and some of those items
for the for the well i guess we ' re sticking more to social changes but
uh - huh
people want all of that and not all of those are necessities
right
there we go
a family reunion this past year first time in many years and
uh - huh
and i had three of my sisters there with their family and we all got together in gatlinburg tennessee and
oh great
oh
spent the week there up in the mountains and rented a little house and
how nice
sort of visited and got to know each other we hadn ' t been around each other for quite a while over the years so it really was sort of nice
oh
well that is nice was it was it awkward at first or did it work out fairly good
well it worked out fairly well you know as a kid i don ' t know about yourself but we used to have big reunions and it was so nice and
yes uh - huh
you know it ' s just something that you don ' t do anymore and we had such a good time that
right
um - hum
that we ' re already deciding to have one in two years say in disney world or somewhere in florida just get together and
oh great uh - huh
just something you need to make time for
now are you from quite a ways away from each other so that you don ' t see each other real often
oh
oh yes
so we don ' t get to see each other very often
oh yes okay well we have
several different reunions
when i was like you say when i was growing up we had a lot of family reunions and they were the extent of the cousins and you know relatives and great - aunts and uncles and
sure
well that ' s great
yes it is and it and these are people that we see you know just once maybe twice a year
uh - huh
and we get together then and have a christmas party and
and you know have a dinner and a program and renew acquaintances and
and then in the summer on my mom ' s side of the family we go camping up in up in the mountains like you mentioned yes it is it ' s fun
well that ' s neat
which you in a great area for it
yes we are there ' s lots of lots of nice places to go and i know some families have a real formal type thing where they send out
i admire people do that but we ' re just not that well organized and you know everyone ' s heading different directions so it ' s very hard to get together
yes
yes that is in fact i in a in a magazine i ' d read an article about different ways to plan a family reunion and
you know if you had a real big like you say a real big organization and a lot of
a lot of planning went into it that would that would be great but we tend to stick to the
call each other and you know we plan on those two that i mentioned every year for sure but
sure that ' s the important thing just the important thing is to do it
yeah
that ' s right
and that ' s great
that ' s right because you do you forget
the cousins i have they grow up and change and you know you wouldn ' t even recognize them sometimes other than these times that you get together
oh you bet
so do you have any with your extended family or is it mostly your sisters and
um - hum
uh - huh
it ' s like it ' s like high school high school and college reunions i didn ' t go i ' m i just turned fifty years old recently and
uh - huh
didn ' t go to many reunions until i hit my twentieth i believe and of course i haven ' t missed one since then because it ' s just so enjoyable
oh
oh yeah
you get to see all your old friends and what ' s going on and it ' s just a it ' s a neat deal i look i look forward to them
uh - huh
boy i ' ll say yeah so do you when you have your when you got together with your sisters last year did was there a lot of catching up to do
oh yes
a lot of changes that had happened since the last time
yeah kids getting older getting married and graduating high school and college and whatever
um - hum
oh
just lots of things to catch up on and we spent that time to do that
uh - huh did you take your kids with you or was it the adults
no this was this was just for the big guys just for the parents
oh how fun oh that ' s fun
it was sort of neat though in fact we had a little rule that we would we would not take the kids with us this time but all of our kids are a little older so
oh uh - huh
that makes a big difference
yes all of our kids are in a middle and high school and college so and married so
uh - huh
oh
so we just all got together and it was sort of neat
that is that is that ' s it ' s a fun thing to do and i think it ' s important that we keep doing that because everybody is so busy you lose
you lose touch and you lose ties
you bet because my mother and dad both were there so it really paid off
oh were they
yeah it was neat and her four kids were there and their spouses so it worked out real well
oh
what do you think about the peace corps or public service commitment
that ' s the first i ' ve ever heard of it i haven ' t heard of it
anything too much about it
well i think it was thought up when there was so much controversy about reviving a draft and people said well they young people who were drafted have to
provide military service to the country but there are an awful lot of young people who would
benefit from some sort of public service like the conservation corps back in the thirties or
uh - huh
various other things of that sort and it seems to me that it ' s not a totally bad idea but i don ' t quite see how they ' d make it work
uh - huh
how would they decide who goes into building fire breaks in yosemite national park and who goes to saudi arabia
right yeah i the my first impression was it would be very good i think it would be good for people to serve but
i don ' t know if it should be an option it would be great to have some of those organizations like you mentioned that were during the depression or coming out of the depression available for kids and i think there are some
available now where they are able to work but making it a mandatory thing
yeah the difficulty would be in whether it ' s voluntary or involuntary and the people who were proposing it said that it should be involuntary that it should be like a draft
kind of
right
uh - huh
and some people would get military service and some people would get civilian service like working in hospitals this i assume it ' s the kinds of things that they had conscientious objectors do
uh - huh
uh - huh
when people were drafted and they refused to serve in the army they were allowed to do hospital service or things like that and if they or farm work in world war one i remember
uh - huh
reading about and i suppose that there is justification for taking everybody if you take anybody
uh - huh
but i just really think that the difficulties involved in paying them sorting them out assigning them training them would be insurmountable
uh - huh
it seems like you ' d have a lot more conscientious objectors if they had that choice
yeah
yeah you know i ' d much rather work in a hospital than to go to war and i ' m sure most young men and women would and so
well i think that in the in the cases that like that they had to be
pretty thoroughly examined to prove that they had pacifist and religious beliefs and so forth and that this wasn ' t something new just to keep out of going to war it was
uh - huh
something that was a fundamental part of their philosophy of life
uh - huh
well that makes sense and then you run into again to
the bureaucracy in running it you know how you going to cover that many people because we ' ve got a lot more people now than we did then
oh yeah
sure and in addition to that we have the cost because you have to pay something
so
right
for their room and board and then you have to pay them some kind of a stipend even if it ' s like the peace corps where they don ' t get most of it until they come home you have to pay them something
uh - huh
uh - huh
plus the training involved yeah that would be expensive in most cases
oh yeah
yeah now i had a lot of friends who went to the peace corps back in the mid sixties
because
uh - huh
and it really did seem to be a worthwhile organization but on the other hand i ' m not sure what the permanent value of it was i don ' t know what we got for all the money
uh - huh
we had an awful lot of idealistic people who went off to what was then east pakistan is now bangladesh and to algeria and to
uh - huh
southeast asia and lots of out of the way places but i don ' t know if they really had significant effects in the places where they went in teaching the people how to cope with their lives better
uh - huh
well i know in i personally took a year and a half and went as a missionary and taught christianity in japan
uh - huh
and i was living such a stringent lifestyle that it was very beneficial to me it taught me not to be so self - centered and it you know to think of others
uh - huh
but i don ' t know if i was doing it
in different situation you know not a really religious background if i would get a lot out of it you know i think i did because it you know it emphasized that sort of thing you know a lot of
sure
self
and it was definitely voluntary too they were not drafting you and sending you against your will
evaluation but
right and that i ' m sure that would make a big difference too
yeah well what about a voluntary program do you think that would be a good idea
you know we ' ve got
well like i say i know that there are some type of programs that they have available for a youth like teenagers to go
and do work in the national parks and work in neighborhoods to do clean up and that sort of thing but i don ' t know
what organization it ' s under i don ' t know if it ' s a government run or if it ' s a private
i don ' t either
charity that ' s put it together but i know that helps a lot with training and
yeah out here in california there ' s a program like that for juvenile delinquents the ones that are not dangerous and they don ' t have to be locked up go to these camps
a lot of
uh - huh
and they do forestry work they maintain trails and they put up signs and they do fire prevention work and certainly things of that sort
uh - huh
and that i know is run by the state but there may be other things i ' m not so sure what kind of training that is for the future for those kids
yeah how much benefit it ' ll do them in the long run
it ' s probably a very good way to keep them off the streets and out of trouble but whether it ' s something that they can put to economic use later on is a different subject
so that ' s yeah so that may not may not benefit them in the long run
oh
yeah i ' m sorry i ' m going to have to go but my other line is blinking but it was good to talk to you
but
okay did it click okay well how do you feel about food and cooking
yes
oh i love food and i love to cook i really love to cook i ' m not a really gourmet cook i ' m just a normal everyday cook what about you
um - hum
well we ' re vegetarians and we just became vegetarians for i just became a vegetarian over the past year and a half
and it ' s a real challenge to find foods proper foods to eat and
it ' s a real challenge not to become like what they call a junk food junkie where your menu is composed of
things that you want to eat that aren ' t you know that aren ' t don ' t contain meat products or don ' t contain animal products but maybe aren ' t you know balanced meal so to speak
so but we feel a lot better since we ' ve become vegetarians
don ' t you do you miss meat at all
i did at first but not really no not i can ' t imagine eating meat
the reason i tranged changed to become a vegetarian was for ethical reasons so the idea of me eating meet would be like eating something you know i think of it as something alive
you know so it i can ' t do it you know for me it ' s it just
um - hum
but i do sometimes when i smell meat you know when i smell particularly say steak or something you know that i do admit that i
you know wish you know that i could have that flavor but i know what it i know what it is so i you know i don ' t want it but
so if you have if you have people over would you fix all vegetables or you know when you cook for company do you fix just all vegetables
yeah you you ' d be surprised the things i mean you could like tonight we ' re having nature burgers which are like a grain burger
and you can it ' s really pretty good i the people i serve it to like my sister and family members
well my family members are vegetarians now basically i mean they ' re not they ' re not when they go out to eat they sometimes eat other you know meats and things but at home we eat vegetarian meals
and you can you know make pasta meals and
different things that people are use to eating that wouldn ' t offend you know that they wouldn ' t be offended that there wasn ' t a meat there
yeah
you know at the at the table or even pizzas you can make a pizza that ' s not that doesn ' t have any animal you know
you would have animal products it would have cheese but you know not meat
yes but that ' s
do you eat cheese do you eat eggs an
yeah we do eat i had become for about three or four months i was a vegan which is a person that eats no animal products no cheeses no eggs
and that ' s even more difficult it ' s really hard to find the products and it ' s hard that ' s even harder to keep yourself from eating
because it adds so much to meals you know when you put cheese on something or
yeah
you know it really makes a difference
eggs yeah eggs my mother just said eggs it ' s hard to find substitutes for eggs when you ' re baking and cooking and things
yeah
so although you can i mean there ' s cookbooks and there ' s ways to do it it ' s a lot more expensive too i think you know the market is just not made for a vegan so but
but it ' s becoming more that way i think it ' s probably easier now to find things
yeah it if well it really is because just today we were in the grocery store and they had lentils and i
and where we ' re living now is a small town that really doesn ' t you know just having that kind health food store that caters to those kind of needs and you just have to hope that the grocery store will you know the bigger grocery stores
yeah
and they actually had lentils which some stores don ' t have things like that you know which
i don ' t think i even know what a lentil is
yeah see that lot of people don ' t and that ' s
i ' ve heard i ' ve heard of a lentil
yeah like lentil soup or something people don ' t and that ' s such a good source of protein or like soybeans you know people think ugh they think it ' s something really
uh - huh um - hum
horrible but there ' s a lot of things you can buy that have soybean products in them to begin with that you don ' t even know where in there so
it ' s just a matter of learning you know
you had to learn i was going to say you have to learn a whole new way to cook
yeah so but it
oh no way
but i bet it ' s really i bet it is healthy because a couple of times last week i went without meat
i had pasta and salad for two days just because i just you know oh no particular reason i just didn ' t feel like eating meat and i think even after two days i felt different
um - hum
yeah well think of it think of it like this takes a long time for meat to digest
and you know if you ' ve got that sitting in your stomach i mean even when you sleep it ' s still sitting there digesting so you kind of giving your stomach a chance to relax a bit and not have to work so hard to digest all that meat
yeah
you know because it takes longer than some products some other foods in your stomach to digest that meat
yeah
so
so when you prepare a meal like say on thanksgiving what do you
you prepare a lot of vegetables and there ' s lots of different casseroles and things so you just make you
yeah
everything but the turkey
no yeah you just you just well see at ours we ' re living with my family my folks now so
you know they have the turkey you know they do they you can ' t stop you know everyone ' s life but
yeah
i think if in our own house we didn ' t we would have things like a casserole things like that centered more on
the vegetables as far as
we might have one special dish one special casserole that was our one special thing like the turkey you know with the main meal kind of thing
and i suppose because it ' s for me ethical we ' d just play up the fact that
thanksgiving ' s you know is a time for everyone to give thanks even turkey you know yeah
even the turkey yeah that ' s true
so
but it it ' s interesting finding different recipes although my mother is the one that cooks
which
well do they have special cookbooks out for just vegetarian meals you know special books that you
yeah lots of them lots of them and i have this one in front of me right now as a matter of fact it ' s called sundays at the moosewood restaurant and
it ' s out of new york it ' s a pretty famous restaurant out of new york and almost every single recipe in there is vegetarian there are some fish recipes i think in it but a few of those but not anything
but you don ' t eat fish either do you
so there ' s quite a few out there
i have a
i have a hard time with vegetables i don ' t i when i was a kid i didn ' t like them very much and i never really learned how to cook them
right i guess i don ' t know
um - hum
i ' ll eat a little bit of broccoli and i ' ll steam it and i like carrots just certain things you know but i ' m not really good with them and i ' ll go sometimes and not even fix them i mean i ' ll have everything else and no vegetable that ' s strange isn ' t it
this is a healthier way to go you know and this is what your body wants this is what your body really needs and when you think about what is what ' s the real reason your eating i know i know it ' s for taste because i ' m boy am i a taste person but
but the main reason is for fuel you know and when you read so much information that tells you that meats
and different animal products you know are causing can cause different kinds of diseases
and the people i really think in general people in the united states just don ' t eat enough vegetables you know because
you can talk grain all you want as far as you know cleaning your system out so to speak but you can ' t beat vegetables to give you all the nutrients and vitamins and the kind that you can ' t get from a little pill
yeah
because your body doesn ' t synthesis in the same way that it does when it gets it in raw food you know
but now if you cook them wrong you can loose the vitamins to
yeah that ' s true that ' s true so you it ' s all important you know it ' s an all important thing that you
and i ' m terribly overweight i ' m obese probably is the word i ' ve never used that word on myself before but i am very large and probably if i could give up the meat products and just get on vegetables i would probably look a lot better
yeah i would say you know almost everyone and except me except myself and you know my husband but
and yeah i
well what are the others
well i originally came from saint louis so the saint louis cardinals are one
i moved to kansas city see i have i have a tendency to adopt teams when i went go to a go to a town yeah so i lived in kansas city for a couple years and i adopted the royals i lived in houston for two and a half years so i adopted the
well it ' s helpful
the houston astros so i mean you know i ' ve got quite a few
well do you keep up with the statistical stuff
no i don ' t i don ' t get into that too much every once in a while i will keep in touch with maybe like who ' s in the top five of hitting or something like that but i don ' t get into you know how many errors somebody has or things like that
well there ' s a guy on that was on norm hisken ' s show that i listen to going to work in the morning who does it ' s essentially trivial statistics but they ' ve got a it ' s a statistic that has to do with winning
um - hum
um - hum
and losing one run games
i ' ve heard of that one
and apparently the rangers last year won a lot of one run games
well i didn ' t know that that ' s supposed to be a real good statistic
well it is but it ' s the it ' s a reverse indicator
well that ' s true they don ' t have the offense to get out or to have the more runs so
well what the what the argument is and it it ' s one of these statistical gee how can you draw a conclusion from it but they find that there ' s a connection between that and how they do in spring training the following year
um - hum
and it ' s strangely enough it ' s almost like the law of averages catches you on the following year
hum
which means that if you have a good year winning one run games that the following year
you ' ll have a bad year and they they ' ve got they ' ve looked at i think twenty three teams
and the statistics are something like twenty one out of twenty three it was which means that the rangers are going to have a terrible year i
which i was kind of leaning toward anyway to tell you the truth
well i mean and it ' s i don ' t know what do you what do you think of incaviglia ' s loss
i kind of think it was necessary i mean i don ' t i ' m not a big
pure power hitter anyway i mean i don ' t like these guys that get up there and swing for the downs every time i mean i think that a player ought to hit a home run if he ' s got the pitch to do it
but when you get two strikes on you have a you know you should you know shorten your swing a little bit you know if it ' s a perfect shot go for it but i mean you know the strike outs were a big problem for him and plus supposedly what i heard he was not much of a team player anyway so
well it it ' s an interesting concept though when you look at of how baseball how apparently i was reading in the paper tonight that the detroit tigers are going to sign him
and the point of i guess i don ' t understand the strategy of how baseball works but it seems that
you know they can sign him tomorrow and he could go in the team the next day and they put him in the lineup and he hits a home run and all of a sudden he becomes a hero and all he has to do is hit the ball i mean it ' s not
um - hum
yeah well that ' s true
and all he has to do is one you know hit it once it doesn ' t he can he can he can swing a couple times if he if he fouls it up he can swing as much as he can it ' s an interesting
um - hum
right
an interesting concept of how they do that but i agree with you i think that i think that ' s part of what
baseball needs more of i guess what bothers me is that when you go you wait and wait and wait and finally a guy gets up there and blast a home run
and that ' s all the game is i ' d rather see the ball hit around and
have the people
yeah well there ' s another point to that too they said that he was horrible at batting with men on base now
having somebody get up and hit a solo home run does you know gives you one run obviously but i mean if you can ' t do it with men on base there ' s something definitely wrong you know you you ' ve got to be able to get the two and three run home runs you know to be able to
yes
score enough runs to be able win in these in this day and age so
yeah well how do you think the royals are going to do
i think the royals will
do okay they have they have several pitchers that had badly years last year and they are they ' re these
cycle pitchers they pitch one year bad one year good one beer bad one year good saberhagen has won supposedly the cy i think he won cy year two out of three years and you know so he ' s very much due for a good year
well are they going to beat are they going to beat oakland
well now see that ' s a good question i that ' s i don ' t know how oakland ' s going to react to being swept in the world series last year they could very easily
take that as a challenge which is the way most teams you know naturally do and just go out and not give anybody a chance to beat them so
yeah
well i go to saint louis from time to time and i watch i watch their sports up there and they ' re certainly intense about the cardinals they
um - hum
oh yeah baseball is there is there life up there like football is down here i think
did you actually live in saint louis
i lived in the suburbs of saint louis yeah
everybody does right
i had a friend from college that lives in yeah it ' s well i should say on the west side i mean everything ' s on the west side manchester
um - hum
out that way and went and visited him but anyway it is interesting well how are the cardinals do you still keep up with them or something
hum
yeah oh yeah i definitely do in fact i ' ve got family that still lives up there from what i hear from everybody up there they ' re not going to have a good year because they let too many people go but i ' ve been following spring training and they ' re like one of the best teams in spring training so far so
well is that a good indicator
that well it can be it really kind of depends on
what they were you know what they were looking for in other words if in spring crain training they were looking at all their kids like a lot of them do
then it really doesn ' t give you any indication but if they were playing the people that they ' re going to play then that might be pretty good indication so you know it ' s not a great indication because there have been teams that have just
you know come out and just won all kinds of games in spring craning training and then gone on a you know fourteen game losing streak in the first of the season so
you know what i think ' s remarkable is it seems that what you really need to do to win though is to have a team that has reasonable talent and has some people that have really breakthrough years
exactly yeah
and the question is how do you forecast that if you had to you know if you had to bet on who would be in the world series i mean it ' d be really tough
you can ' t
right i think the best thing that you can do is go with the players that are
that have the talent to do the best years and that they hadn ' t had these
gigantic career years yet and just kind of assume that you know one of them is going to break through eventually so and i think they said the reds this last year i ' m not sure that they said that they had that many people having career years
yeah
yeah
you know and so they may be even better this year
well when are the rangers going to come through with it
that ' s a good question i the rangers have a have a pitching problem
and whether or not they can fix that or not is going to be an interesting question they ' re doing the right thing though they are going with their farm system they ' re letting their farm system build up and stuff like that and
well is there enough money that ' s part of it i oh that was part of skip bayless argument i don ' t know if you read skip bayless but a local commentary and
um - hum
no
um - hum
his argument is that the ownership is not inclined to lose big money long enough to bring in the big dollars
that ' s probably true well considering what i ' ve seen in the last you know two seasons i ' m beginning to agree with that yeah but i mean you don ' t have to spend the big money as far as i ' m concerned to
would you would you agree with that
to win you just have to spend it if it ' s necessary in other words if you ' ve got a player on your team who ' s helping your team then keep him there don ' t let him go away you know and i think that ' s really what ' s been hurting the rangers
yeah
well didn ' t kansas city put up quite a bit of money for their pitching staff
oh yeah they spent more money last year than any other team in the in the league and they were you know toward the bottom of the league so it ' s like i said spending money doesn ' t guarantee you winning a pennant
it really doesn ' t so
yeah
well and that i think that ' s maybe part of it that the and it you know if i owned the team i think you ' d like them to do well but the question of losing big money that what didn ' t did steinbrenner actually make money on the
you got me i you know i think that there ' s coming to a point real soon when ticket prices are going to be to the point where the average fan can ' t go and once you do that you lose everything i mean
well it yeah it ' s a little bit like any other sport you know when it starts costing you fifty to a hundred dollars to go to a game
um - hum
and you know i mean i guess as we get older if you ' re probably going if you if you compare to go to a sport a say you go to a rock concert or even a performance
um - hum
an opera or the symphony or something if you know but how often do you do that and i would i would think baseball probably feeds on a number of people that can go out there you know several times a
right
that that ' s the whole point there ' re so many games in a year that they ' ve got to have repeat customers they can ' t afford not to and
yeah
you know that ' s one of the things that i think saint louis has done i mean their you know their ticket prices are you know i guess as high as anybody else ' s but what somehow or another they attract
it seems to me that the benefits of working for a big company tend to be the same things that are to their determent
they aren ' t as responsive both to like bad economic times you don ' t have to worry about your job all of a sudden disappearing
yeah
but when you see a job when you see a job that needs to be done sometimes you have to fill out the five forms in triplicate in order to get it done you know what i mean
oh wow
so it ' s really small and i think it ' s really nice because you know it ' s real easy we don ' t really have much to do but it ' s just me and him so if he needs something done i do it or
you know it just goes straight from me to him and we don ' t have to go through a bunch of people like you ' re saying but
right
but sometimes it ' s kind of bad because if i ' m sick then i kind of i usually have to go in unless i ' m you know have to stay in bed because i ' m the only one there yeah
there is that i mean well and then i guess again i like i said when i when i started off that the advantages tend to be the same things that the disadvantages i mean if i don ' t show up for work there ' s probably somebody else that could fill my spot but
yeah
i imagine and that ' s nice but it ' s also nice to be able to
yeah
know that you are the person that makes things get done you know if you ' re not there it doesn ' t happen
yeah
yeah and also in big companies they have like vacations and all no if i take a vacation i ' ve got to get a friend or someone else to come in for a temporary to come in for a week
yeah
oh wow oh wow
um - hum
so
oh yeah
i had some friends of mine get sent up to stanford for a year for college or for like for grad school and i guess getting stuck in california for the summer is not such a bad thing
yeah
yeah
you know but
a friend of mine works for a stockbroker and it ' s a really it ' s a big company and they said that
uh - huh
as a after she works there a year as long as she takes business courses they ' ll reimburse her
uh - huh
so that ' s pretty nice so that she could move up in the company
yeah
yeah
yeah but i would think that a smaller company you would have a i mean if a small company hits some niche in the some niche market that it is uniquely qualified to
take care of it has a chance to grow really fast
yeah
and if you can get on top of it before it goes up i mean you know if all of a sudden the company expanded to like you know three thousand people you would probably be one of the top people
yeah
of course i guess if there ' s only the two of you you ' ll i mean i guess you ' re one of the top two people but you are also in the bottom half so
yeah
so the only other thing i can think of is stuff for
things like if there ' s some kind of child care if someone were married and had kids
yeah that ' s
yeah that would be nice
yeah
if you wanted to you could stay with the same company and decide you wanted to live in another part of the country
yeah they moved my dad worked for i ' m not even sure where but they moved us from dallas to san antonio and then back to dallas
we kind of got moved around but it was pretty nice because you know we lived in san antonio for a while and all
i mean i guess it ' s nice if you have family that lives somewhere else and you want to be next be near them you can see it switch through the company to over at that state or whatever
yeah i do i mean i think it kind of helped us because you know we weren ' t just living in dallas and didn ' t exactly know just everything about dallas and you know i mean i doubt seriously that
if we had stayed here that i would have been able to move to get to san antonio very much so
oh you had family in san antonio
no we had family in dallas and we moved to san antonio and we were kind of like everybody else is in oklahoma and louisiana
oh
okay
so but i guess it was pretty nice because you know we got to experience living down there somewhere different
yeah
and we moved like oh man we used to move like every three years at least
yeah
well i always think i ' m paying too much taxes how about you
although at least texas doesn ' t have a state income tax yet i mean you know they keep threatening us that maybe there ' ll be a day that they ' re going to enact this i think
the other means of providing income for the state have been dwindling so they keep trying to say we may need a state income tax
yeah i think that we probably will have to have to have a state income tax because texans don ' t approve of such things as lotteries
well i come here from new york and new york had a state lottery and it really raised a lot of money for the for the state
uh - huh
although we in new york we had to pay a state and a city tax and it was really a great relief when i got to texas that i didn ' t have to pay that city income tax though
yeah makes quite a bit of difference in your well your income level you know because other states take quite a bit a chunk out for city and state taxes so you ' re looking at your yearly salary it makes quite a difference
right
it sure does make a difference
a little more take home here
uh - huh do you live in dallas
yeah richardson area
oh you do oh
yeah i work at well mainly the expressway site is where i work
oh i do too
okay
and then you know too that taxes are less like if you live in mesquite
yeah
you know some people will go shopping in mesquite at the malls out there
or up to collin county somewhere that you ' re getting out of the dallas county area because what do we pay like eight and a half percent something like that for the sales tax
uh - huh
eight point five
um - hum
which yeah that really is pretty high
is it the is it less in collin county than it is in dallas county
i think so although i really i don ' t go up there too much i mean i normally just kind of go to richardson square mall or valley view mall just kind of for the convenience
yeah
um - hum
um - hum
yeah it sure did and then once you could deduct at least some of that off your income tax and you can ' t do that anymore
yeah
it really hit me yesterday i had air conditioning service for my car done and i had a little coupon special that was twenty two dollars for air conditioning service where they
uh - huh
checked it and recharged it and put one pound of freon in and if you needed another pound of freon they it was like seven dollars and something
and then with the with the twenty two dollars and the seven something it all came out to i ended up paying like thirty four dollars and i couldn ' t believe it and the tax you know really hits you
yeah that ' s true although i wish you know overall they ' d try the lottery again when did you first come to texas
um - hum and then
oh it ' s been i ' ve been here for nine years
well that ' s about the same time as me i came down in eighty two
really where ' d you come from
well ohio kind of my parents live in ohio i had lived a little while in michigan but you know basically i went to high school and college in ohio and lived there more years than i ever did in michigan
oh uh - huh
um - hum
um - hum
well i did visit michigan i visited kalamazoo once my sister used to live there
oh okay but you know when we first came down here i really thought this place was somewhat backward i mean i was just shocked that we couldn ' t shop on sunday
uh - huh
remember
well i ' d say they closed maybe eight or nine o ' clock the department stores on christmas eve but there were stores that you could go to you know like discount stores and
uh - huh
and stores down in the village and just all over the place where you could go to and you could shop till like twelve or one o ' clock that night and that was like that was really the only night they were open that late but it was christmas eve and when i came to dallas
uh - huh
were you shocked like oh no i ' m stuck i need to buy stuff
uh - huh
oh few places now seem to do it by the slice but
yeah now but they but back then they didn ' t when i first came no
right
anyway
well the there was other things too i mean i think it ' s taken us yankee ' s influence down here to get them to come to the you know the correct decade here and century
yeah
i couldn ' t believe that you could have open containers of beer or alcohol whatever in the car
right
i mean you could always be careful about that back then because you know if a cop stopped you then you would you know get arrested or whatnot and people would just drink openly
uh - huh
uh - huh
yeah and talk a talking about alcohol and beer look at the taxes on that and the taxes on a package of cigarettes i used to smoke you know and
uh - huh
that would have been enough to make me give them up the price of them now but i gave them up a couple years ago because i had some sinus problems
oh well i don ' t smoke so i don ' t really know what the taxes are and stuff on it
well
well they ' re like two
or i believe they ' re hitting two dollars a pack now
maybe a little bit a little bit a little bit more in some places
so you end up about paying about twelve dollars for a pack and two dollars of that is taxes
well i believe it ' s a little more than twelve dollars for a carton i think it ' s maybe thirteen or something
huh
gee
because i remember we went to oklahoma to this bingo place this choctaw bingo a couple weeks ago and somebody that went with me bought a carton
for ten dollars and something and they really thought they were getting a big discount
they ' re cheaper there
well because it ' s you know the indians i don ' t think they pay tax
oh
in oklahoma
oh i got you okay
and it was a indian
uh - huh
it seems to me that most people rather make a decision between going all out
particularly males go all out on the career or they go or they spend some real quality time with their kids when their when their kids are still young and are willing to spend time with the parents what do you think about that
um - hum
yeah that ' s an interesting point i work in the computer business which tends to be pretty
high pressure and time consuming and i work with a lot of guys who are just now having first and second kids and it ' s interesting to see how they handle it because in a lot of cases they ' re still trying to put in the hours but they ' re also trying to spend a lot of time at home
and in many cases they ' ve got spouses who work so it ' s an interesting juggling pattern i
my impression is that people try to do both if they can as tough as that is
do you think it ' s possible
boy that ' s a good question i ' ve my kids are eight and a half and
work long hours so that you know during a particular week i might not see them as much as i wanted to
um - hum
but i do sense that people ' s expectations today are often different than they were maybe in my parent ' s generation where
you know child raising was kind of seen as the
the woman ' s responsibility and if the man had to work extra long hours or travel you know that ' s just the way it was i think
today men have somewhat different expectations when they try to tailor their schedules as much as they can
i got my office mate he got divorced and
he was talking about that the thing that he was gladdest about in the relationship that he was in before that he spent like
a lot more time than the average father with his kid i mean he took his kids out ice skating and water skiing and i mean just if there was something that he could think of to do with them he went out and did it
uh - huh
and now that he ' s no longer the wife has custody of the kids he still has a good relationship with the kids
uh - huh
which you know a lot of people even in marriages that stay together try to all of the sudden get to know their kids when they turn eighteen or something like that
sure
but i think i think he did the right thing is making sure that the kids really
i mean they might get mad as heck at the parents but making sure that the kids know from you know one two three that there ' s no one that loves them as much as dad and mom
you know
yeah i think there ' s a lot to that you really have to establish relationship early on
yeah certainly read a lot or heard a lot of stories about people who grow up saying i felt i never really knew my father
yeah
and i you know it ' s hard to say i don ' t
travel in a wide social circle but it ' s my impression that a lot of people today a lot of men are trying to change anyway
i think it has been changing over the generations you know i see my granddad
now and it ' s really it ' s really way too late i mean my granddad grew up in the military you know he was always the never show your feelings but it seems like he tries real hard now to try let his sons know that he loves them and it ' s
i mean to some extent it ' s too late
my dad i ' m sorry go ahead
yeah
yeah i was just saying yeah
yeah my dad
i always knew that my dad loved me he but he never really said it until
oh i don ' t know i think i was in college the first time i actually heard him say it
but i always knew it i mean he always he always did things so that i knew it
but i think i mean granted it ' s easy to say i don ' t have kids but i think that ' s one of the things i really want to make sure that i do a lot is say it
as many times as just so that they get oh you know come on dad stop that but you know i mean you know i don ' t know
yeah actually i ' ve heard a lot of that from my son who you know goes through periods were he ' s particularly
attached to mom and when i say i love you know he says i hate you
uh - huh
i ' m a little i ' m a
not i think that
that i do i i ' m not sure that
that i think it should be like a normal practice all the time i think there are certain circumstances where it ' s important but it kind of touches on privacy
in that addiction thing you know and it ' s bad for them but
and some jobs require you to be
straight and with it to do a good job and protect yourself and
and things like that too you know so how you think how you feel
well i ' m kind of ambivalent also like you say it does affect your privacy i guess i
how i could cope with it i do think in some cases it does make sense and how i could cope with it was if when you accepted a job they told you up front this is part of it
right
there you go that ' s right
there are certain jobs in which i ' d be more likely to feel comfortable about it and those are the jobs in which a person ' s performance could affect your life
um - hum
certainly someone who carries a gun
um - hum
there ' s been a lot of publicity in new york on long island where
there ' s been school bus drivers
who have driven erratically and caused accidents and killed kids because they were
wow
on drugs and things
yeah
and where your actions could affect somebody ' s life i ' d be much more accepting of drug testing but under no circumstances would i think that you could just go take a job and they could say hey guess what you know we ' re gonna do this
right
i think it has to be up front and then you ' ve got the choice of not doing it
yeah well the problem there is that you know a lot of people that have worked for the same company for so long that company decides well if we ' re going to hire new people you know
well we ' re going to have to start checking it because we ' ve had a problem in the past
well yeah i imagine it would be just this is new company policy and we ' re doing it to everybody
yeah
in which case hey you know you don ' t like it you can go look for another job but of course that ' s not so easy you know
there ' s one of the big problems people are in that situation they need that job
right
and
oh really
lucky you
well you know i ' m home a little too often i think they ' re not calling substitutes that often but at any rate i had taken a state test to be of all things a court officer
uh - huh
my mom had worked for the state and she thought this was a brilliant idea so i just went along with it i thought it ' d be neat you know like a james bond woman with a gun and all this and part of the you know you take this test i did very well and they called me in for a physical
and part of it was a test for drugs nobody asked me you know they didn ' t mention what they were doing but it was perfectly obvious and i you know all government people and all army people are just tested
right
and there was one fellow who just kept horsing around he seemed almost
you know a little crazy
right because you ' re not gonna get the job if you don ' t
it was it was almost comical
in my case they didn ' t follow me in the bathroom but apparently they were following you know the more suspicious types into the bathroom
yeah
you know because apparently people i read somewhere that you can replace your urine with warm sprite or something mountain dew and it tests you know that it tests like urine and you know it tests okay obviously
huh
i don ' t know
uh - huh yeah you know i mean i guess if there i guess there is something to be worried about if there ' s a whole science of knowing how to deal with the test
you know
all right i like keep forgetting to make these calls i ' ve been on this list for two months and i think i ' ve made four calls
oh really i just
oh i just got mine last week and i haven ' t started yet because i wanted to get one first see how it worked
right
well they do have some kind of nice prizes and it ' s worth doing and i ' m so mad i think i ' ve had this for two months
and like i ' ve said i ' ve made four calls and lot of times we don ' t answer the phone probably when i get mine early in the evening
really yeah
i have i was trying to think of the one i went to a couple of weeks ago but i forgot it already
i really haven ' t seen one since probably august because every weekend in the fall we go to our high school football game on friday then we go out with friends after and that ' s kind of the
oh
that ' s your weekend yeah really
really i didn ' t see that because i didn ' t think i would care for it
no and my husband dragged me to it i like i think kevin costner ' s a nice fellow and he ' s nice looking but he just to me is not a very dynamic actor
oh
yes i did see that and i really enjoyed that
i did too i thought that was so cute and
yeah i thought that was appropriate just for everyone yeah that was great
oh i do too oh i really enjoyed that
yeah and my daughter went to see that one too so it was fine for her
and
so yeah
right well that ' s right
probably they have them my daughter is twelve
oh
and we had a sleep over one night they wanted to watch pretty woman which i have and i was hesitant and they all had seen it anyway
um - hum
oh i know it that ' s the way it is
we can see some pretty raunchy stuff on just regular tv without cable or even you know there ' s no way to protect them any more
yes they do yes they do
so
really
oh i love pretty woman and then i like that one after that where oh what was it was like a fatal attraction thing yeah
oh the scary one oh yeah i didn ' t see that
i don ' t remember the name of it but that was so good
oh really
that was really excellent
oh i like scary ones that are realistic
what was
oh i don ' t know
really
oh and my kids both saw that they liked it
i that scared me to death and i watched it at a friend ' s house on video and i was just oh yes it was horrible it was so awful
it was still scary oh my gosh
i know that one sounded gross i know my husband wouldn ' t have stood for that he likes mary poppins and things yeah
really
i like that too i like funny movies and i like scary movies
i do too i really like a variety
yeah
where you from
is he really
oh
yeah yes it ' s so close because i ' m from long island so that ' s close you know that ' s more related to new jersey than it is to like rochester new york those that kind of thing
oh
right
i don ' t know they talk up there
yeah different it ' s different yeah i guess
just different um - hum
well see the accents up there fascinated me because even in his family alone there were several different accents the way they would pronounce words differently
oh
really
and his family they lived in the same house there most of them were twenty or so you know
really and they were all from new jersey hum
yeah um - hum and they lived you know they never moved into apartments when they were young they always stayed at home until they got married it seemed to be the custom up there or they went in the service and so they were together for all that time
really yeah
but they still had the accents differed a little in the family
huh
so and it
when did you live there
in the sixties i finally
oh really i converted him to being a texan i just thought life would be i knew it was easier back here
are you from texas
well sort of i ' m an air force brat but i was real familiar with texas i went to college here and everything
oh yeah
oh yeah
and i just thought you know we could probably get a better house and life is a little slower a little easier and he loves it he really would never want to leave so it worked out
it is it is yeah
i ' m used to it now so i like
probably hard when you first came
hum
was it hard when you first came
oh yes it was because we ' re here eighteen years
oh my
and you can imagine what plano was like eighteen years ago
oh i know oh compared to new york oh yes
it was very difficult
yeah it was very difficult i didn ' t even want to talk
you all transferred
yeah
okay i really haven ' t thought about the topic of drug testing but just off the top of my head
i ' ve i don ' t think i see much wrong with it
if i owned a company and i wanted to make sure that it was run smoothly and that the people that i had coming in were trust worthy et cetera and so on i think i would i would
probably do the random testing just to insure that my company runs safely and smoothly
yeah i also haven ' t thought too much about it but i suspect it very much depends upon the job
um - hum
um - hum
maybe there are some jobs where i guess it doesn ' t really
hum
yeah that
i mean it ' s if it ' s not affecting someone ' s performance i ' m not sure if it ' s a problem
um - hum
yeah
if it ' s a position where it could potentially affect
that ' s true i didn ' t think about that like for instance if someone ' s working on heavy machinery or say driving trucks or buses city buses or something like that
you know if
right
then that is something that affects the then affects the community
you know if you ' re if you ' re drinking or on drugs or whatever you ' re driving a city bus you taking several lives in your hands
that don ' t
right and then if you ' re a computer operator and there ' s really no big deal i think you know then maybe it ' s not
yeah
necessary
yeah for me i think that drug testing just it follows the path that society ' s going in if more and more people are using drugs then i think that some people have to guard against people that are using drugs
um - hum
i mean it ' s just it ' s just where society is right now and you know something we have to cope with and i think the drug testing is something that drug users have to cope with
but
yeah well i think it may i mean that in that respect i think it may help a lot i think it may be pushing people away from hopefully push people away from drug use if they know that you know well if you use drugs you won ' t get this job i mean
um - hum
yeah
i think that may be
yeah that may be one of the points of it
yeah
of course i think i ' m not sure you know what the time span is but i mean if i think if i used drugs last week and i had a you know had a job interview that i wouldn ' t use drugs the day before or something and they wouldn ' t even see it
you know i ' m saying they can ' t they may not be able trace don ' t know how far you trace i don ' t know what the you know limits are or
yeah i don ' t know
i don ' t know the that would actually be an interesting thing to find out i think i don ' t i don ' t actually know how long those things stay in the blood in the system i ' ve heard some you know you so some things supposedly stay for six months some stay for less some stay for longer i mean
um - hum
um - hum
yeah
they think lsd i guess stay forever in some ways i mean if you get flashbacks for
hum
yeah
forever
oh really hum
i guess so
something like that yeah
i mean there must be some
some something i mean people who people get these little flashback things you know
um - hum hum
of some sort so i don ' t really know
yeah i mean i don ' t use any drugs i don ' t really drink or anything so i ' m pretty
i guess decisive about that just the fact that you if since i don ' t use drugs i have no problem with taking a test
right well the same here actually i don ' t use drugs at all and i and i ' m at most a social drinker so it ' s so it ' s never a problem
that just it yeah
yeah um - hum
if you don ' t have anything to hide you ' re not going to mind it
um - hum right
you know but for people that
you know don ' t have anything to hide and then there are some things that just aren ' t people ' s business you know that they come out at that point so i think a lot of people have trouble with that
right that
that ' s a fine line to draw
and i can i can understand that um - hum
i mean that that ' s really you know do you
do you worry about you know this or that i mean you know what about their rights to privacy well if they ' re doing something illegal there they have a private you know like especially in the case of drinking you know if someone ' s
yeah
um - hum
right
is something more than a social drinker shall we say yet they ' re not an alcoholic what do you do
um - hum
yeah
so
i mean i took a lie detector test once and it i didn ' t mind it but i was just offended by some of the questions i guess i mean there was one question do you like your mother you know i said yes do you hate your mother no have you ever killed your mother
and i was just going you know what in the world
well those are just yeah those it turns out those are just to get a probably to get some sort of
those are to get some shock value out of you or just to see what happens when you get shocked yeah there ' s i do some i ' m a student in
is that what it was i just
okay
and we sort of you know figure out
um - hum
hum
um - hum
so it kind of get kind of get something to measure my responses by i guess
yeah otherwise they have no idea if you ' re just sort of jumping around and being fidgety and they say that you would sort of it can be shocking and it they want to see how easy it is shock you
yeah
um - hum
they ask that i was going what in the world are you asking me about here you know it ' s just
yeah
but i guess i don ' t know some people probably have killed their mothers i don ' t know but
yeah well i guess so i mean i guess i don ' t i don ' t what actually happens if
um - hum
you get a big a big jump there you know
yeah
but yeah it ' s i think it ' s their way of seeing how well you do in a shock situation without worrying about you know stuff like that so
um - hum
hum
yeah and i don ' t think that you killed your mother though i wouldn ' t worry about that
i don ' t think that some thing i mean there are some people
i mean because society a lot of people are taking drugs there is also people that are getting off drugs and trying to do better with their lives
but they take a lie detector test or a drug test or whatever
and the stuff that happened to them you know five years ago comes up and it spoils their chances for just making it a little better you know when they might be actually trying to improve their lives you know
um - hum
yeah that ' s you know it could blow things right away for them you know unless they say well look i mean unless they walk it won ' t
um - hum
i ' m thinking walk in and say look i did do drugs you know a year ago and i ' m off them for a year now and this and that and so if you if i take i ' ll be happy to take the test but it will show up positive of course i think
um - hum
um - hum
yeah i would probably do that and i ' d probably bring something in showing that i had been to such and such hospital for help or you know whatever the twelve month program or whatever it is that they do
yeah
yeah because then i mean then although legally they can ' t discriminate you i think on the basis but i ' m not sure
um - hum
but i don ' t i don ' t really know i don ' t know what the laws are pertaining to this my wife probably does but
yeah
i ' m not sure what they are either
i don ' t i don ' t of this stuff
but
but yeah it ' s an interesting topic that they ' ve actually thought about your right in that it doesn ' t
um - hum yeah i the other day we had talked about
capital punishment
and i really i really hadn ' t thought about it i mean i think about it because i hear about it
um - hum
um - hum
um - hum really
so i think that ' s real good
um - hum
so you have a son
i have a an older son yeah he doesn ' t have any children yet though
uh - huh
he ' s thirty seven and i don ' t know if he ' s ever going to have any or not but i do have some neighbor kids lots of little neighbor kids
um - hum
that i go out and i play ball with them
you know it ' s because like this one that lives right next door her mother does some work at home on computers and it just seems like she doesn ' t have any time for them
um - hum uh - huh
which is kind of sad you know
yeah
so the kids are kind of hungry for someone to play with them so i will go out and play catch with them or you know we let the dogs outside and they will roll around on the ground and play with the dogs
but actually i do think that the parents should have you know a little bit more time to spend with their kids
i would think so when you when your son was at home did you working did you work or were you able to stay at home with him
no when my son was at home i did work and then he went to a baby sitter that this lady had about five other kids that she baby sat
you know but we always had our days off together and we went camping on vacations so we had a lot of time together that way you know
uh - huh
yeah well when my mom when i was growing up my mom worked too but she worked nights
uh - huh
and as a nurse and so she was always home for us
uh - huh
and i always i really appreciated that having her there when i was you know when i came home from school and when i worked
but now when i look back at it must have been a really difficult thing that she did for us
oh yeah well i am sure it was you know but
i don ' t know what the families are really going to come to nowadays because they just there just doesn ' t seem like they do have time for their kids because most of them the father and the mother both work
you know
yeah
so it ' s really rough i have one neighbor that ' s the father is a fireman
and he works like four days on and it seems like he is suppose to come home for like three or four days
but he can ' t make enough as a fireman to support his family you know so he ' s got a second job
so he ' s you know he ' s not home very often
yeah
and that ' s you know the kids i know miss that you know
they really do a family without a father is it ' s a it ' s a really hard thing
yeah you know and i don ' t know i suppose they are trying to get through to them that well daddy is not home because
you know he is out working trying to make some money for you know we can buy you this bike and that toy and so forth you know
uh - huh
but
kids i think would much rather have dad there than the toy anyway
oh yeah oh yeah our uh - huh but we ' re we just got married like december so we ' re going to wait a year and then we will try
yeah well that ' s good yeah that ' s
that ' s what my daughter - in - law had told me that they were going to have kids
probably after two years of marriage
uh - huh
so i don ' t know she ' s a nurse you know and she has brothers and sisters that has got lots of little kids so maybe they just decided that
if they wanted to have kids around the house they would just you know call one of their sisters or brothers up and tell them to send the kids over for the night
yeah that ' s a possibility yeah well we really want to have a family we feel like that couple you know
you know but
you ' re not giving enough of yourself and you should you should be sharing your family
uh - huh
uh - huh so
and giving your values to you know making something better of the world by raising up good kids and letting them know they ' re loved and stuff give them give them an edge but
right
right
we feel like the first year needs to be devoted to making the family the couple strong and secure in their love for each other
uh - huh
right
but then a family is definitely a high priority
yeah do you plan on staying home after you have your children or do you do you work or what
well i i ' m in a different situation i am a missionary
uh - huh
and i ' m home on furlough it ' s called like i ' ve worked for four years in africa and i come home for a year
um - hum
and then we go back for four years but my husband and i will do the same job and we ' ll be living in africa and we ' ll be working together
um - hum
so we will we will share the job of raising the family i mean as a mother i ' ll have certain responsibilities that he might not necessarily have but still we ' ll share that job
um - hum
but we have then we have decisions that we have to make that are hard about schooling like do you want to home school your kids on a computer program
um - hum
you know that kind of thing
in dollars and lives and the long term effects
uh - huh
well
oh i ' m ready yeah sure
karen my name ' s john benyak where do you live
san francisco
oh i live in dallas
oh nice to meet you
just outside of dallas
nice talking to you
what ' s that mean we ' re ready to go
ready to go
okay well it the way it turned out it wasn ' t worth anything really i just don ' t think i ' ve always thought that
it just wasn ' t carried on the way it should have been it wasn ' t carried on like a war i mean if we were in there to fight a war regardless of the reason we were there it should have been fought like a war it just
what would that how would that have been different if it had been fought like a war
we
well i think we ' d beat them i don ' t think
i don ' t know what would have happened twenty years later down the road with the country within and with us but i think if we ' d had allowed the military people to conduct it like a war
instead of letting the politicians and the
you think it was a winnable war then
oh yes yeah i mean it was just a two bit country always was and always will be and or at least it is now and there ' s no way
that if we ' d been able to take
use the capacity that we had the potential we had to fight a war against a country like that we would have what would have lost it as a war the long term effects well
uh - huh
i don ' t know that ' s a little tougher to answer i think
depends i guess on who ' s in office but i think bush used that last year in the persian gulf by taking some stronger measures and when the war started
you mean the effects of vietnam being to encourage him to be more defensive in his posture and go for
be more or be more offensive well once the war started once they
i meant offensive i ' m sorry uh - huh
once they decided to fight the thing we take a take a much
run in there and do it as quickly as possible rather than let the thing drag on i guess what happened back in vietnam is that they we escalated and just you know on a gradual basis and gave the
north vietnamese and viet cong time to adjust to our
increases in personnel and so forth they just didn ' t go in there if they ' d a sent five hundred thousand troops in there at one time initially i think things would have been differently but different but it they went from
having the advisors up to that four hundred to five hundred thousand troops over a period of time a long a long number of years and as i said i think the
uh - huh
the enemy just gradually adjusted to that and
they didn ' t the people the country the people here didn ' t want the war the way it turned out they didn ' t want it that ' s
i do think one of the effects was that the people involved in that kind of an activity were surprised at the power that the media had on intervening and probably
uh - huh
set the tone for media ' s involvement in future whether it was a war activity or
right
oh really
right well there are
everything changed after that in terms of media
yeah there were every night you ' d come home from work and or school or whatever and see it on the news i
imagine that wasn ' t the case during world war two or any of the other wars people just didn ' t feel like they had the involvement in it and there were a lot of
uh - huh
a lot of
well you remember in the gulf war they made a specific effort not to repeat the mistakes that the media they felt the media made in
uh - huh
vietnam war they weren ' t about to have people out in there reporting
right
right yeah but i just
i guess i was in my let ' s see
my twenties during most of that war and i never did think that they were they were doing it right i i ' m just not a fan of jane fonda and people like her i mean that she ' d go around speaking on different campuses and
uh - huh
getting people aroused about the whole thing and of course they always talked about the vocal minority and i guess that ' s what it was the solid majority and the vocal minority and
people were listening to her and i guess politicians were too but i just felt
i was in the service at that time i wasn ' t over there but i just felt that they fought the thing i mean they just didn ' t fight it like they should have and it ' s a war whether a war is right or wrong you i mean if you ' re over there and
uh - huh
people or young people men or women are dying they ought to fight it as a war and
either win or lose based on the fact that it ' s a war and not just mealy mouth their way through the thing and try to get the other side to give up on the basis of what they thought we had in terms of power and so forth
that approach probably would have shortened the time that we were over there too at least
where taxes are high and services are low
hm
i guess i ' d have to say i don ' t think we ' re getting our money ' s worth as far as the tax system is concerned i think a lot of it is going to waste
on services that aren ' t necessary and out - of - date ideas that just don ' t make sense anymore in these times
yeah i have to agree i ' m right now i ' m in atlanta but i grew up and am from utica new york
so i understand and i agree with the new york situation
hm
yeah it ' s as a matter of fact they recently in our county here our state sales tax has been seven percent
right
pretty much forever well they ' ve just decided now when our county where i am is looking at upping the tax rate to eight percent to try and close a deficit that they ' ve found in the county budget here and
right
you know between the increases in the sales tax and of course we have the high state tax
right
now we have to look into the possibility of you know it if it isn ' t from the bush administration with user fees it ' s more direct taxation
right
i don ' t know what the taxes are like down in georgia
so they ' re not i don ' t think they ' re quite as bad as they are in new york state i guess is my opinion right now there is like there are there ' s a tax on food here which is you know a little bit different because they don ' t have that up there
and other than that right now they ' re starting to realize that their taxes are low
but they also realize that they still have to make sure their roads are paved and so on so they ' re starting to talk about raising like instead of registering or getting your license which costs five dollars now they decide to well maybe we should charge forty dollars for it
right
up here considerably and you know we ' ve had our road taxes and gas the gas tax was such a utica boondoggle being from utica you probably
yeah
yeah that
right
of course
of course
no that seems like we ' re in from new york state i guess you ' re pretty much your main concern is yes you sit there and to allow you know taxes like crazy and all you do is see all the money go in a big funnel towards new york city
well yeah it ' s you know roads this year have been especially bad they here in rochester they ' ve now to save tax money and that they have turned off the expressway lights at night
oh yeah um - hum yeah they ' ve been talking about doing that here too but they haven ' t they ' ve almost been able to push it through but people started complaining and
well they just shoved it through here and you know to hell with people and put it into effect and then suddenly of course you know ever since every day in the newspaper here it ' s
yeah
people complaining you know well it was only saving two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year it ' s we ' re paying good tax money for this and
yeah
they turned it off yet they ' re still giving money to all these bizarre things in new york city the roads aren ' t any better here
right
right
and even the town here where i am in the taxes have increased again i mean they just can ' t push property taxes any higher that ' s why they ' re looking at this sales tax business now
yeah
yeah that ' s down here they ' re i ' m amazed at the one cheap thing down here is gas i ' m not sure what the price is up there but that down here it ' s only like eighty nine cents per gallon
oh that ' s not moving you know that mario up here is we ' re i just filled up tonight it was a dollar it ' s a dollar fifteen nine a gallon
yeah i was home over at christmas break and it was i saw the gas prices and it was like boy what a switch
well you know we also have a somewhat of a monopoly here of the gas suppliers you know anywhere else in the state it ' s a nickel less but they say it ' s going to increase around the summer time to a dollar twenty five up here
yeah
oh sure yeah
yep
well as soon as they get near memorial day people start traveling and everyone knows it so we ' ve got to raise the gas prices
yeah
so
yes i know i and i just i actually had filed earlier and i got my refund tonight actually small but small but i got it back anyway
yeah we ' re
we ' re just sitting down tonight to get ours filled out we ' re going to do it we ' re going to do it and we ' re going to get we were doing software to do it and then you know put it off put it off
oh
oh yeah
yep
yeah well it ' s
okay tell me about where you live
uh - huh
just close to richland college do you live in the area too
yeah
oh okay
although i did live in dallas for six years up until nineteen ninety and then i moved to houston
hm
um - hum
but i had lived in houston before and from nineteen eighty to nineteen eighty four and worked downtown
uh - huh
and when i was transferred from atlanta to houston i bought a condo in southwest houston
uh - huh
no and i clocked it and it was only nine miles from the office and of course didn ' t think that would be bad but the only time i ever drove it was not during rush hour
so it was a rude awakening to me to find out what i faced every morning and every afternoon in houston traffic because where i lived in atlanta i lived right on peachtree a mile and a half from the office
oh
uh - huh
and so i wasn ' t accustomed to commuting and it nearly killed me so whenever i moved back to houston i said i declared that i would not live where i had to drive on the freeways so now i live
in really inner city and but it ' s only it takes me about ten minutes to get to the office and i love it
um - hum
well what kind of a house is it now are you still in a
oh okay
i mean
most of the people that i work with you know commute in anywhere from
thirty to forty five minutes some of them an hour or more one way
um - hum
i just i can ' t do it so
right
anyway i ' m pretty content for the time being where i am
oh we rent a duplex right now and it ' s only like a couple of miles from where i work it ' s a little bit further for my husband we used to both work at the same building at ti and it was only like two miles from the duplex
uh - huh
now he ' s moved but he ' s going against the flow of the traffic so it ' s not too bad of a commute it only takes him about fifteen minutes
uh - huh that isn ' t bad really
yeah
right
you know it ' s like i said i mean i ' ve even had people at the office ask me they say how do you justify paying the kind of money you pay for rent because i do pay a lot of money every month for rent i don ' t deny it
and they go you know they ' re jaws dropped and then and then they go and i spend way less than thirty minutes a day
round - trip commuting and you know that doesn ' t that ' s regardless of the weather if it ' s raining it still doesn ' t take me any longer i mean sometimes whenever and you know how houston is it ' s just so flat
uh - huh
and we have these torrential downpours sometimes and people literally get you know traffic gets backed up with the wrecks and everything and it ' ll take them an hour and a half to get to work
um - hum
and they ' re just frayed by the time they get there i think no way so
yeah and i think too now we both have little bit older cars i mean both our cars are over ten years old now if you get a house if you buy a house more for your money further out you ' re gonna have to have a pretty decent car and put a lot into
that ' s right
i mean you know if you ' ve got to drive it sixty miles a day you ' re gonna go through that car a heck of a lot faster than what we did i mean that ' s not something people think about is the car the car payments and the gas
um - hum
last year i put less than twelve on my car
you know and you can really tell a difference i mean i just don ' t you know it ' s just not
um - hum
i don ' t have that expense and by the time i cut down the cost of my insurance because my car insurance is a little bit less by living so close then the additional automobile expense
um - hum
yeah
well seems to me the one of the reasons that people don ' t go out to vote is maybe they ' re bored with the whole election process
well i agree with the boredom of the election process but i also think that people don ' t realize that their boat vote will make a difference they feel like that
you know it ' s going to go however it ' s going to go and their one little vote ' s not going to make that much difference and it ' s just why make the effort
well sometimes strangely enough one vote has made the difference
well i agree with that and i and i do know that you know all those votes are counted and they do make a difference
also i think that
people have a tendency to vote in the larger elections and not vote in the
the more local elections
well it ' s kind of strange because in the local elections is the ones that have the most influence on their day - to - day lives
exactly and i even have a tendency to do that myself and i have to really make a concerted effort to get involved i lived i live in a suburb in mesquite
and so i really have to make an effort to read the local paper and to see what ' s going to because that directly affects me but i think on the whole most people don ' t
feel that way or don ' t look even look at that i think they just don ' t even
i don ' t think they ' re conscious of it
well main part of the problem is they don ' t they think they have enough choices
well that may be true too i hadn ' t thought of that
you know in some of the european countries they have numbers of parties that run and then lot of more voters come out to vote than vote in this country
um - hum
right
and sometimes it ' s
well not sometimes but many times it ' s who has the most money to spend on the largest campaign and
and issues get bogged down
well maybe it ' s a matter of you know voter awareness
i think voter awareness i did some work for the women ' s league of
voters several years ago
and i think there are some organizations that used to do some voter awareness things they don ' t get a lot of participation they don ' t get a lot of
activity most of the league of women voters
what they did was they put out information
so that it would just be made available to everyone now other areas that i ' ve worked in like in the chambers they would just have the candidates come and it would just you know that was not a lot of community involvement and those were people that would mostly vote anyway
well i think part of the problem is the election goes on way too long in britain you know they have a set period of time and for campaign that ' s it in this country it seems like it ' s a continuous ongoing campaign
it ' s a it ' s an ongoing campaign and it ' s expensive campaign and it eliminates a lot of qualified people
maybe more qualified and more dedicated
to the issues
well the they don ' t want to spend the time or they don ' t have the money
exactly
exactly and it
i can ' t i just can ' t believe i ' ve worked in a couple of local campaigns
i just cannot believe the dollars that are spent just even locally
well it ' s a matter of name recognition people aren ' t going to vote for someone they ' ve never heard of
oh well i agree with that
but also and i and i ' m not for
controlling how much is spent but do you know
that ' s one thing if a if the time wasn ' t so
if it wasn ' t such a long campaigning time
then
they couldn ' t spend as much money
and even debates don ' t seem to help much
no they really don ' t
it ' s a lot of it is who looks the best
who
who happens to say the right thing at the right time who not it who may not be
so we ' re really voting for the best makeup person and the best handlers
exactly
and it ' s a it ' s a i ' ve worked in public relations a lot and
that kind of thing can make and break make or break you as you can
campaign
well that was certainly a media event
it really was and it ' s just
he possibly could have won that election had it not been for some of the
the way he presented himself
like what authors
well let me see well the most my favorite ones are kind of an old author edgar rice burroughs
uh - huh
and he had a series of called john carter of mars i don ' t know if you ' re familiar with it or not but he ' s the one that wrote tarzan of the apes and all that too and
no i ' m not
oh that ' s interesting
no i have never really never read science fiction much
uh - huh
yeah
then i like what else do i have there oh it ' s a series of another fantasy but it ' s fred saberhagen and it ' s the it ' s the sword series which i liked and gore i like too it ' s another fantasy one
uh - huh
and starting i think i ' m going to start pick up a few more science fiction as far as well as isaac asimov have a number of his books too and h g wells
right
that ' s older stuff
yeah but i think they ' re pretty good and then i ' m i think i ' m going to start picking up some of the newer star treks because i hear they ' re pretty good too
yeah
oh really
kind of a hush thing that she ' d written this book so we all had to read it for a sociology class so no i don ' t the author was like madge larson or something like that it was a kind of feminist
do you know which one was it
uh - huh
uh - huh
uh - huh
kind of paralleled that with kind of a space version of it and it was kind of it was interesting i don ' t know if it was interesting just because i knew the person who ' d written it or if it was actually a good book
uh - huh
yeah
but i ' ve never really read a lot of science fiction it ' s
uh - huh well i sort of read mostly in high school and you know and i and i like it you know as the light reading and everything and i recently completed graduate school and i ' ve really kind of got interested
right
through a number a couple of classes that i took there on history and stuff and i ' ve gotten a number of history books but i haven ' t read any yet you know
right
halfway there so that ' s good
uh - huh
uh - huh
uh - huh
yeah and what which ones do you like
well i ' m i like a lot of contemporary short stories
uh - huh
authors like bobbie ann mason she ' s from kentucky and writes a lot of just kind of contemporary realism sort of stuff john barthelme who wrote he just died a few years ago and he wrote kind of weird avant - garde
uh - huh
uh - huh
if i ' m reading kind of trashy stuff i like i guess kind of mystery books and then stuff that ' s funny i like pretty much any humor book
uh - huh
and gosh oh
well i ' ve got those as far as humor i ' ve got a couple of irma bombecks too
oh that ' s fun
uh - huh
right
do you
yeah they ' re pretty funny because it ' s really kind of interesting and those are kind of neat too and i ' ve read i like steve well i like some of stephen king
yeah
yeah i like him
uh - huh
yeah i used to
i can ' t even think of his
oh what have you read by him
the books of blood and cable i guess how you say just you know some paperbacks and stuff
uh - huh
oh i ' ve never read anything i got a book of his out of the library just the other day to try it out i ' d been to england and thought you know he ' s like the british stephen king so oh really i ' ll have to
oh did you
oh well he ' s next on my list to read i ' m reading a little private eye book now
yeah
and then of course i ' ve read the
clancy books
yeah
you know hunt for red october and red storm riding rising
well actually you know red storm i haven ' t i ' ve started red storm rising but i really recommend hunt for red october
uh - huh
because it really it ' s good and it keeps going pretty quick but the red storm rising i ' ve heard and then it ' s been apparent the first you know few pages or whatever it ' s kind of slow in starting and everything
well that ' s good
right
but it ' s not a bad book at all
yeah actually i got an old copy of moby dick that i like too i read a while back
that ' s one i just my very favorite book so if i had to go read something again i ' d probably read moby dick or scarlet letter i also like
uh - huh
no i actually have never seen any of the star trek movies was that oh well that ' s interesting i had a roommate in school who did a did you ever see the movie heathers
oh you hadn ' t two was really good because he quoted a lot from moby dick
no i didn ' t
oh it ' s kind of this sort of black comedy movie about this these kids in high school who
are not real popular and they kill all the popular kids in the class it ' s kind of bleak but it ' s sort of fun and they do a lot of moby dick i had a roommate who wrote a whole paper on moby dick and heathers and
uh - huh
uh - huh
wow
i like john irving that ' s
john irving yeah
he hasn ' t written much in a while but
yeah oh yeah that ' s good
yeah i ' m trying to think what else i ' ve read that i ' ve really just loved
i don ' t know how i it ' s hard to read when you ' re in school it ' s like you just read those textbooks and that ' s it
yeah
but i guess maybe in the real world too you just don ' t have time to read but
yeah that ' s pretty much the way it is usually i try to i have some a book or two by the bed and then maybe like i get to read for twenty minutes before i go to sleep or something
uh - huh and then you fall asleep and have to reread it the next night because you forgot what you ' ve read yeah i do that too oh i like larry mcmurtry he ' s good and like lonesome dove was
uh - huh
it was a long book but it was really good
really
uh - huh
i liked jaws and the deep and the island those were pretty good so i would read that
uh - huh
rick
well as a person living in one of the areas that ' s got both the one of the most restrictive set of laws and one of the highest murder rates in the country
uh - huh
i happen to be an opponent of gun control
well that ' s interesting
i happen to be
kind of funny of course i had a radical turn around in my attitude about that about four or five years ago
and along with some other political what do you call it
changes too i formerly was one of your typical new york left wingers
that you know that ' s what i suspected
talking to a new yorker i thought that i ' d hear someone who was totally for gun control
uh - huh well we ' re not all like that
about a year ago i engaged in the arduous six month prices process of getting a fire arms license
and
not long after that my wife engaged in a similar process and now when we get a chance which is entirely too infrequently we can go down to the range and shoot together
yeah
i used to do a lot of that it can be a lot of fun
all right where you are you can go to sears right
yeah i think so
really yeah
i ' m not sure about sears but i know the sporting goods stores and i know sears used to sell guns i just i ' m aggravated with sears right now
yeah you know the stores are here but it ' s you know you walk in and i ' d like to look at that okay fine let me see your paperwork
it ' s kind of funny because we are going out to california in a while and out there you can walk into apparently there are ranges where they rent which is something that to me is completely foreign
but i may get a chance to try out some things i ' ve never tried out before
yeah
yeah well i grew up in new mexico and you know guns were a fact of life
ah
um - hum
my granddad hunted and what not you mentioned
that you ' ve gotten the fire arm permit is this for a hand gun or does are there are the laws as restrictive for rifles and shot guns
yeah
for rifle and shotgun you ' ve got to sign the federal form but that ' s about it
i see
and i really don ' t know where they stand on semiautomatics these days
yeah
they ' ve been getting a lot of bad press
yeah
it ' s
well you know i guess i could summarize my feelings about it as that
i would like no restrictions on me and a total ban on most people
sounds fair
my ex - husband would choke if he heard me say that
uh - huh well you know it you know it ' s kind of interesting you say that because we had a series about a year and a half ago
of murders here four within the space of about two months
and the profile of all of them was
a couple got separated the guy had menacing the his ex - wife
they filed the court order to keep him away he got picked up once or twice and then the last time he didn ' t get picked up he just came in there and killed the woman
oh
and there were four of these within a couple of months and nobody seems to connect with the idea that
you know there are you know maybe just maybe she could ' ve had a better shot at it if she ' d been armed
literally yeah
you know at
i don ' t think so i think that there made a strangulation or stabbing in there you know i don ' t know the specifics but
you know it what was that
oh my wife is screaming shotgun
what do you call we had
maybe this is fundamentally my attitude changing
when he pointed out that the purpose of the police was not to prevent crime
and his comment was
well in order to prevent a crime the police have to be where the crime is taking place now they can ' t be everywhere they can be very good at deterring crime
right
they can be very good capturing criminals and enforcing the punishment of crime but they can ' t be good at preventing it
uh - huh
so if the police aren ' t going to prevent it who is
i see
and i thought it was you know a very nice elegant piece of logic there and it ' s absolutely true you know it
you know so and i imagine the more rural you get that the truer that is
yeah
you know kind of funny i was just looking at a book today where some fellow was his car had been stolen
and he was screaming at the police primarily because about two days before you know they were telling him we ' re spread to thin to enforce car theft and a few days before they ' d given him a ticket for parking fifteen minutes late at a meter
yeah but
are you a member of the nra
as a matter of fact
card carrying it ' s about i think it was renewed for the second or third time
is that right
and
my ex was a long term member of the nra
okay so you watch david letterman
yeah
well see our favorite tv show i live in a dorm and our favorite tv show is cheers
uh - huh
oh really yeah that ' s pretty awesome too i watch it every now and then that ' s hilarious

yeah
no oh you missed wayne ' s world wayne ' s world was pretty cool
are you serious they ' re awesome
so let ' s see what else see like all we do here is like every time we walk in the room we turn on the tv
oh really
because we don ' t want to do anything like study or anything so all the all we do is turn like when i was in high school i used to do like my homework in front of the tv set you know
yeah that sucks
really kind of annoying but that ' s cool
what
kind of annoying to like in front of tv like trying to do homework you know
yeah
trying to write an essay you start talking about you know like
in living color or something i don ' t know
cool yeah bs that ' s the way to do it
cool yeah works for me
so let ' s see what else like the news we don ' t watch because they ' re boring
no unless
i watched through the war you know there ' s only one
yeah especially the war i mean it was like i haven ' t i seen this episode before you know
i know i guess they think that people don ' t watch tv but i mean if you watch it like five minutes then it repeats the same thing over and over and over
yeah i know
it ' s like oh man
yeah
oh
it ' s like you know even though two hundred and fifty thousand people died somewhere else they ' re not going to tell you know they ' re going to spend more time on doing a thing on a on a cross guard who ' s a hundred and five years old than they are on anything else you know
yeah
so but let ' s see what else oh we watch like for example okay do you watch star trek
i haven ' t seen it in years but i used to
okay well i used to hate star trek
yeah
i thought i thought like when it like when i was like in high school and junior high school i used to hate it
uh - huh
but then we started watching it and like the new ones are pretty cool because they got like special like especially things that like fuck with your mind
really
oh really that ' s cool
uh - huh
are you serious oh man
that ' s cool
kind of like pink floyd or something
yeah basketball ' s cool but football kind of after a while
which basketball
which basketball yeah i kind of like college better it ' s more spirited
college or
well we got we got two teams of the acc going there
oh yeah
we got duke and north carolina
cool
but i mean the i mean there ' s nothing to do like for example yesterday
uh - huh
they go some girl goes do you dares want to go to a picnic right
uh - huh
i hear no we ' re just you know it ' s like we just woke up we had a hangover and everything you know and so we just woke up and we ' re watching tv and i go no today we ' re just going to dedicate ourselves to watching golf
and bowling you know and everybody was like it was like oh god do you guys really watch that no you know i was like a whole golf tournament it ' s like for example baseball i hate baseball i mean
oh me too
somebody told me like that like you can watch baseball and the actual play time that there is five minutes
uh - huh
because by the play time is when the person when the pitcher pitches the ball and it goes to the catcher or when the when the pitcher pitches and it ' s hit
yeah
yeah
okay and that takes like you know five seconds for the whole play
that ' s true
yeah that ' s true
and that ' s it i mean maybe a home run could last a little bit longer because the guy has to run around all the bases you know but i mean it ' s like that i mean it ' s was it ' s just
but when i went home that ' s all like they had on tv so i had to i watched entire games of baseball and they ' re going oh my god and tv in argentina ' s really bad
oh really
oh really so why from argentina why ' d you come over here
because i wanted to go to school here
oh that ' s cool how long did you live there
yeah they have better computer science up here than they than they do down there
oh
so and i also my father works for ibm and we came up here we well we came to the united states in nineteen seventy six seventy seven
uh - huh
uh - huh
yeah
and we lived here for about seven years then we moved back and so then i said i ' m going to move back up there to go to college
huh
he goes okay so he goes but do it fast so i did my undergraduate in two years yeah
that ' s cool
oh really awesome
that ' s cool
groovy
and well tell your dad that now he owes you five bucks
yeah no doubt
okay
okay
all right nice talking to you
yeah you too
okay well i guess you ' re pretty aware that it ' s been a little warm for this time of year
oh yeah
it the humidity ' s a little higher
it is this is muggy today like it wants to rain but it don ' t know what it wants to you know
for this time of year
uh - huh you know about a month from now this wouldn ' t be so bad but boy for the end of march this is this is funny
no
oh jeez
well that ' s a good way to look at it
i always do that i got to do something like that with the weather
well if you do that then you ' ll only be pleasantly surprised probably if it ' s anything but that
that ' s right
that ' s
but i guess the winter wasn ' t that bad down here really
no see that ' s it was a mild winter that ' s why i keep saying oh no
yeah looking forward to a really bad summer and hot summer
yeah i think it ' s going to be really hot this year
well hopefully you know if it ' s humid now maybe it ' ll i remember last year it rained an awful lot or you know for the last couple of years it ' s rained an awful lot and maybe that ' ll help to defeat some of the heat
yeah
um - hum
and if it rains a lot
but
if it rains if it rains any more and gets really hot then we have this problem with mosquitoes
oh yeah you ' re right yeah i used to live in up north up in the upper midwest and
see
and we had mosquito problems that ' s for sure
well see i would prefer the cold
i ' m from southern california
oh really
well you know it ' s that easy to say but boy when it ' s when it ' s forty below and you ' re shoveling snow and it ' s forty below it ' s
no i don ' t want to get that cold now
i don ' t think no i don ' t want to go no where up north no where
does it go in any where north of the red river
huh - uh
i don ' t even want to go anywhere yeah that ' s about it
that ' s i that ' s what i ' ve heard people say is they ' ll never go north of the red river again
that ' s right it ' s too cold up there
um - hum
and then last year that ' s when they really had that cold spell
um - hum
you know it was like
record breaking below temperatures and stuff in alaska where your car was freezing while it was running
you know the oil or the gas would turn to slush huh - uh see i can ' t handle that
yeah i know what you mean because you got to have like little oil heaters where they plug in the plug in your car
um - hum
yeah
and that ' s not that ' s not good at all and
no something happens then what
well i guess i guess the only thing to do is to hope that this is the worse that it gets this year
yeah it ' s not that bad right now i just hope it don ' t get any worse
yeah or if it if it does get worse it doesn ' t stay for very long
that ' s about it i ' m just waiting because see it ' s tornado season
oh that ' s right that ' s right because
yes it is it ' s tornado season
already hit oklahoma and probably right down here soon so
um - hum you see this is this is tornado weather boy people don ' t know it but when it gets hot like this
yeah
and you know like they ' re predicting the weather to be cold well when it gets cold real fast
um - hum
um - hum get a northerner through here
there ' s your tornados that ' s right and so they ' re predicting this weekend probably drop something like thirty degrees i say huh - uh see that ain ' t right
that ' s right
no
no it ' s
but that ' s tornado season
yeah and i guess that ' s shows what they say about dallas if you don ' t like the weather just wait a day yeah it ' ll change on you
wait a while it ' ll change
that ' s right that ' s about like it is too because yesterday was really nice
um - hum
uh - huh
and the wind was blowing but today is muggy but the wind is still blowing but you know
i don ' t know
the
well anyway i guess that ' s about all i got to say about the weather
that ' s about it that ' s about all you can say about the weather
okay
talk about it but can ' t do anything about it okay
that ' s right
okay i work with a lot of students and in my occupation talking to them about college and going to colleges i think
um - hum
the advice that i give to would give to parents i ' ve had four five sons that have gone to college
that will go along with their goals as far as what degrees they want to go into and they if they ' re in the local area they don ' t have to pay out of state tuition and all of those things
and
yeah that ' s certainly helpful
and
staying within state i realize that there are a lot of schools unless the student has a real specialty
and there oh maybe are one or two universities that are highly respected in that field they really ought to try to stay within their state i mean
uh - huh
financing in universities now is getting a very high
yes it is
and they can ' t help themselves on that either so it certainly is an advantage to stay within your own state
um - hum
that that ' s kind of the advice that i give and then they need to take a look at the courses of study and how it would go into their major minor field
yeah
what kind of placement they have in the particular area you know i had one son who went to a smaller college to went out in the premed area
um - hum
but they had an excellent record of placing their students in medical schools after they finished the program and he was
that ' s very important
if he would ' ve gone there i don ' t know whether he ' d got accepted to medical school there or not
well that was certainly good advice to get him to go to a school who follows up and has such a reputation that others are happy to get their students that
um - hum
yes
and that ' s good for him too regardless of where he works he has a top level of information that will last him the rest of his life basically
and you can do this for any of the any university or for any of the students that are planning take a look at their final goals at least hopefully they ' ve got a goal of what area they want to go out in and then
if it ' s law school or if it ' s medical or whatever
there are different colleges and universities usually within the state that have a little better placement record or getting them into those higher degree or higher areas of education
um - hum
i see uh - huh
and the field i worked in was acoustics
and we have an acoustics department here and have lots of students several hundred i guess in acoustics and they have an excellent opportunity to
follow through on their fields because our university is well known for it ' s research in addition to teaching obviously if we can do
um - hum you bet
high class research we must be well trained and available to teach the students well
yes
and where it ' s well known the word gets out and that might be a case where even if it was out of state and they had to pay a little higher tuition then it would be well worth the to go to penn state
yes
yes because penn state is very well known in many of its of its fields and
we get a lot we do we only we get our sort of say we get state students not only from out of state but from all over the world
um - hum yes
i mean they really come here we have a very high percentage of foreign students because penn state is pretty well tops in many of its fields
and we have doubled in size in the last fifteen twenty years i guess
um - hum
and if it ' s financially if they can do that that ' s great
which ones have you seen lately
across the country on a crime spree
thelma and louise yeah i haven ' t seen that is it good
thelma and louise yeah
yeah it really is it ' s interesting
is it
oh yeah i enjoyed
yeah i i ' m not familiar which billy crystal movie
oh this is the just the one oh gosh it was the city slickers right have you seen that
uh - huh
yeah i i ' ve heard lots of good things about it and i would have would have liked to have seen it but i was with my wife and i figured she ' d like thelma and louise better so
and i ' d heard it was really good too so
yeah
yeah
that ' s a really good show
okay
has jeff bridges and
uh - huh
really good
yeah there ' s been a fair number of pretty good movies out recently
yeah
uh - huh
yeah
what kind of movies in general do you like to watch
um - hum
no in fact i ' m not even familiar with it i don ' t think
it ' s a i think it ' s put out by landmark productions the same people who put out chariots of fire
uh - huh
mission
at the inca falls in south america northern argentina
hm
really good show
yeah it ' s something that you know it ' s really stirring the cinematography is just beautiful and really beautiful scenes and real good music
um - hum
actually yeah my wife ' s from down in that region around the called the seven missions which are which are right down in this where i ' m sure where it was filmed at
oh yeah
and i ' m sure that would make it worth her watching she my movie watching has severely has changed a lot since i got married
oh yeah
yeah she likes action movies and comedies and so anything that ' s has anything little is a little bit less than sort of mainstream hollywood is
uh - huh
uh - huh
oh
uh - huh
and i find i don ' t do it anymore or else i have to watch them on my own
find something both of you will watch
yeah
she it ' s funny because i mean most women aren ' t really sort of she ' s sort of schwarzenegger fan type of yeah she really likes all these gory shoot them up films
oh really
uh - huh
uh - huh
keep her on the edge of her seat
i ' ll watch them you know they ' re kind of fun to watch in a way
uh - huh
i found when i get when i get with my old college buddy we usually rent good gladiator movie or two
but it ' s fun to
oh yeah
you know which most women won ' t come within ten feet of
yeah that ' s
that ' s great
echo
oh you don ' t
well longer term trends i think that like past oh ten or fifteen years
there seems to be a
trend and maybe it ' s longer than that of politics is strictly a what can i get for me or what can i get for my group and not what ' s
best for the whole kind of a thing does that make any sense or
i mean the
yeah political action committees that and i think it i think it ties in with the budget deficit that the
congress and is they get reelected by what they do for their districts in terms of bringing in and bringing in money and
right
in order to bring in money for their district they ' ve got to vote to spend it in other districts and the heck with the overall deficit and
yeah
districts is geographical but it can just as well be interest groups in terms of
whether it ' s social security or anything that it ' s what you get for your constituents one way or another not what what ' s necessarily good overall
yeah
that the larger states have you know like texas and california but we ' ve got we have political clout only because of the tenure of the people that are in there like for the sub
yeah
like texas yeah
yeah
building you know gratin and they ' re building down in newport now
yeah okay but
but once somebody ' s got to do it somebody ' s got to build the subs and i guess virginia can do it also in fact i ' ve got a
yeah
the latest contract that was awarded virginia sued or has got a lawsuit against gratin to stop construction because it was unfairly obtained or something like that you know
right
this
powell yep
yep
but when those when those people leave the power ' s going to go there isn ' t really anything here because we ' re not really big enough so the economy is going to going to suffer i think because the
yeah
yeah
the base that new england always had the textile base the costume jewelry base most of that now has moved out here to overseas or down south so we ' re prone to
yep
recessions like the rest of the country were before we were kind of stable the political power is the only thing that can stabilize it at least i think up this neck of the woods
yeah
yeah
yeah
but there ' s too many now political action committees and where the money is coming from is coming from those states that have the big industries that can afford to contribute to those
yeah
so those are going to get the squeaky wheel gets the oil they ' re going to they ' re going to catch it and somebody has to do it somebody has to do the work like boeing or general dynamics or wherever they happen to be you know you ' ve only got a few plane factories or
yeah
well
well i guess i guess i ' m a little more cynical than that i ' m not i ' m not sure that it that all of it has to be done even but
well i think they should be outlawed myself the packs i don ' t think they should be
but well in
well i
but i mean in terms of not necessarily all the planes that the government buys they really need or not necessarily well in particular planes and i
true
you know i see this here in texas that got
oh i can ' t even remember which of the companies it is but they ' ve got a they ' ve got a tilt rotor
plane that they ' ve developed and they want to but developed for the defense - partment and defense department is saying well no we don ' t we don ' t really need it it ' s going to be too expensive and it ' s not going to do what we need and
oh like the yeah
yep
the texas people are fighting to have it built for just to just to keep and create jobs here
right yep
yeah
look at look at the tanks now look at that new abrams tank
yeah
and i have no idea what the cost is five million ten million
no
for each one now you can make you can make a missile or a hand held rocket that can take one of those out pretty effectively
yep
what do we need all the tanks for
i mean you can make you can make probably a thousand rockets for each tank
right
yeah
and you can give a thousand rockets of a relatively untrained person and he can take he can take one of those tanks out
yep
but yet i ' m not sure who is it chrysler that makes the tanks or one of one of the
i think maybe so and i think that or
and i don ' t think we really need all that hardware and again like the stealth bombers and some of these things they put on their drawing boards and they never fly or they never they never run right
yeah
yeah
yeah
is it because of political clout
yeah
rather than need i think in a lot of cases yes
yeah
but we don ' t have a watchdog agency to the military overlooks their own testing
yeah
which is good for us i mean it creates you know we generate a lot of income at ti because of the military contacts
right you know that ' s true too but do you see any other trends or particularly interesting events that come to your mind
the savings and loans crisis
yeah
the political trends there are most of these people are lawyers that are now in
the government whether it ' s state or local most of them i guess you ' ve been reading about the problems we ' ve had in rhode island where the governor closed down a lot of the credit unions and banks
yeah
because of it was privately insured but stated
well i certainly did when he first did it but i haven ' t heard about it for a while i was at are
yeah there ' s still a lot of people that still can ' t get their money out
can ' t yeah
they still have to pay their bills like their mortgages and things they slip them under the door to the bank and but yet they can ' t get any of their savings
so it ' s a little bit difficult but most of the people there the trend was that on almost every single board of the institutions that were closed they were state legislators
huh
yeah
so they had a conflict of interest because they tried to get through a bill stating that they had to have federal insurance rather than private insurance and it was squashed
uh - huh
although lately i ' ve been a friend of mine that i spend a lot of time with
does recycle quite a bit and it ' s it it ' s interesting to watch some of the things that she does and then she ' s almost had an impact on me
paper plates and paper cups and i don ' t do that anymore i don ' t know why i just don ' t i just from just from socializing with her so
how do you how is recycling done in your community is
it really it there ' s not a whole lot there really isn ' t i know in my mother ' s neighborhood in san antonio each
uh - huh
each house they ' re given three baskets and they put them out on a certain day of the week
uh - huh
right
and each home does participate but we really don ' t have anything close in this area that do anything and some of the communities that do
the residents are having to pay to participate in it which really doesn ' t make sense
oh
right over here they have several private companies that you can take recycled materials to
but if you want to take them all to one place they have the first saturday of every month they have certain places that you can drop them off that ' s what i do
and i recycle aluminum glass
newspapers
yeah that ' s good
so it ' s nice to have you know one place that you can take them all to instead of driving the glass to one place and
yeah that ' s another thing you have to go to different places to do that
right
right so it ' s so that ' s nice it would be it would be really nice if they came to the house to pick it up and they just were talking about a bill in tucson about that but
it didn ' t go through
uh - huh but i heard that most homes that do participate in that are having to pay a monthly fee to do that which i don ' t know it just doesn ' t make sense to me
so
right i guess what they what they were talking about here was
was reducing the garbage collection in order to make that up or something you know
yeah
yeah
so i guess that ' s one option
yeah
that ' s good that ' s good
i guess one thing they ' re working on now is recycling plastics too like
um - hum
have you noticed that on the bottom of plastic goods they have this little number now that tells what kind of plastic it is
yeah
no
yeah i guess the problem with plastic is there ' s so many different kinds that you can ' t recycle you can ' t just throw all plastic into one recycler
oh i didn ' t know that
yeah so now they ' re like marking they ' re i don ' t know there ' s six seven eight different kind of plastics and they mark on the bottom what kind it is
yeah
so i guess that makes it easy to recycle and then they ' re
they ' re trying to make plastic goods that don ' t have a bunch of different plastics in them you know that are that are only made out of one kind of plastic so that makes it easier i guess
um - hum
well that ' s good i you know unfortunately garland doesn ' t have doesn ' t they don ' t i don ' t know they don ' t do anything like that or i you know i read those little slips that come in your utility bills
right
or your garbage collection and they haven ' t you know talked about doing something like that
where does your friend go to recycle
she lives in garland and i ' m not sure where what she does but she ' s oh she ' s very heavy in that and she takes her own bags to the grocery store
uh - huh
she has i really don ' t think she has any paper products in her house
yeah
and just a lot of things i ' ve learned off of her that to start doing and she does make a lot of sense just her whole house is like wow
yeah
i guess that ' s how it gets passed on you know when one person you hear it from another person and then
yeah
and then you and then you pass it on so it seems to be catching on
yeah
yeah and my little boy watches a program that was really neat i sat and watched him you know the barney
you know the little i don ' t know if you know the little character barney they had one on that kind of type of thing and how children can
uh - huh
wow that ' s neat that ' s neat yeah when you
well i am basically retired now i was a member i was in education and in administration so basically i wore
uh - huh
uh - huh
dresses and heels and i was never one because my work often took me into court never was one that got accustomed to wearing pants suits and pants to work
uh - huh
uh - huh
but that was just me i know many people are very comfortable in the classroom and what have you wearing pants it i guess i was just old enough not to be very comfortable in it how about you
uh - huh well i work at ti and they don ' t really have dress code so to speak there it ' s pretty lax about you know we you can pretty much wear whatever you want to
and i wear anything from jeans when i ' m feeling really casual to suits and dresses when i ' m meeting with a customer or i teach training classes
oh
and so when i ' m teaching a class obviously i wear a suit or dress so
um - hum
it definitely fluctuates mainly with what i ' m going to be doing that day and kind of what my mood is and when it ' s raining i ' m more likely to wear jeans and when it ' s really cold i ' m more likely to wear jeans or pants or sweaters or that type of thing
um - hum
but it just really depends on the weather and my mood and then you know obviously when i ' m doing anything that i ' m in front of people or making presentations teaching whatever i ' m going to dress up more
yes
and i think that does make a difference because when you do have to be in front of people i think you the tendency there is to wear dresses and suits and more classical style of clothing
uh - huh
uh - huh
what about the miniskirt
there are a few people every now and then that wear those to work there pretty strict about that though i ' ve never worn i just wouldn ' t i mean even to well jeans aren ' t exactly professional but for some reason a mini skirt is
to me a little more unprofessional to wear to work than jeans just because it ' s maybe it ' s just because of the sexist views and everything but you just feel like you ' re being
showing too much i don ' t know i wouldn ' t want to wear a mini skirt to work i have seen a few people do it though but they weren ' t overly and they weren ' t overly revealing they were pretty much in good taste but for me i just
um - hum
i just wouldn ' t want to do that
well there are miniskirts and there are miniskirts there are some that are really short and then there are some that may be will come like four inches or five inches above the knee and again it depends upon the size the shape of the person
uh - huh that ' s what i ' ve seen
uh - huh
as well as the shape of the person ' s legs
uh - huh
now i also even though i retired from education i do modeling and i teach at a modeling agency here
uh - huh
and so when we are doing wardrobing and we have two hour classes in wardrobe we do discuss a great deal the miniskirt and the types of clothes to wear on the job
uh - huh
even though i may have them from sixth grade on up through grandmothers
uh - huh
uh - huh
because maybe they those are not the clothes that are the most appealing to you or the most complimentary to you
right
but the miniskirt many times will evoke comments you don ' t really want
and then you ' re in the situation where you ' re very unhappy
uh - huh
well i feel like too on the job when you know there ' s men around and some of the managers are men you just
you know you don ' t want them looking at your legs necessarily and to me i just wouldn ' t feel comfortable in that at work
that ' s right
well i have to agree with that even when they was very popular in the early sixties i
uh - huh
again maybe because i was at the school there were still many teachers who wore miniskirts we had no regulation against it and a lot of the kids did of course and it could be very embarrassing for the men teachers
uh - huh
right
because they were not that careful in how they handled themselves in those miniskirts
right
and so i think of course now i go the other extreme i do not like to see in the corporate areas all the women dressed like men
uh - huh
with the suits and white shirts and ties and what have you so that they all look exactly the same
uh - huh
i don ' t like that i don ' t i think there should be individuality in dressing
uh - huh
even with the very tailored look of a suit sometimes i like to have a just a little something that ' s feminine
yes
not you know you don ' t want to over do it but just a little a touch of it just to say yes i am a woman but i can be professional too
right
well i and i don ' t think that you have to be manish and extremely tailored to look professional
right uh - huh
i think that you make of that what you wish and you can go the opposite direction and overdo all the frills and laces and flounces and what have you which don ' t belong in the at least in my opinion
in the workplace but that you can have a classical look without a lot of a great deal of adornment and what have you and still be very feminine because that was one thing i always fought against i started out as a physical education teacher
right
uh - huh
uh - huh
so i was always fighting against the idea of looking tailored or mannish and people would never ever guess that i was phys ed and that pleased me
right
uh - huh
and so then i of course just continued what i considered the best style of clothing for me at work
and what have you and be very comfortable but when i go out somewhere then unless i have a pair of dress slacks i don ' t usually wear a lot of blue jeans
uh - huh
i have difficulty getting them to fit me comfortably any how and so i just feel that you know each person has to dress to their own liking and for their own comfort
uh - huh
uh - huh
but there are certain norms that companies should be able to put out as guidelines for their employees
right that ' s what i one thing i like about ti is that they aren ' t overly strict about what you wear and they don ' t
you know your boss doesn ' t come up to you and say now remember tomorrow you have a meeting so you ' d better wear a suit i mean they leave it up to you and your judgment to use good judgment and dress tastefully and dress for whatever occasion you may have
right
yes
the only real restrictions they have are no halter tops and no shorts even the long walking short of the squirts the split skirts anything that could be considered shorts they don ' t allow and they don ' t allow
yes
yes
that ' s good
any sweat any sweat shirts or t shirts that might have vulgar or you know anything like that on it but
yeah um - hum
other than that it ' s pretty lax and i think that ' s good because it does allow people to be individual and it allows you to kind of dress the way you feel that day or you know if you want to be comfortable and casual you can and sometimes i think you
yes
may be more productive if you ' re comfortable with what your wearing and can be feel more relaxed whereas
right
sometimes when your in the suit and feel kind of almost stiff and you ' re not you know maybe you don ' t can ' t get as comfortable to sit down and you know like when i ' m writing training material i prefer to be more comfortable unless i know i have to meet with a customer later during the day
right
so that ' s i think that is good that they ' re like that i do know there ' s a lot of companies that are very
strict about what the employees wear and they must wear blue or gray or black and a white shirt and you know no variation and i don ' t i don ' t quite agree with that
yeah
did have a group come over from one of the banks over the children ' s hospital where i was volunteering and they were doing a presentation and every one of the young execs coming up
were dressed exactly alike men and women
they all had on the gray jackets and the gray trousers or skirts and the white blouses and the same color tie i mean you could hardly tell the women from the men except for the lengths of the pants
right
and one was a skirt and one was a pant and i think that ' s sad because that doesn ' t allow for any individuality
yeah
uh - huh
that ' s can stifle creativity
right i agree
so
well it i guess we ' ve talked probably long enough nice talking to you too i enjoyed it bye - bye
all right do you do exercise
i do yes i guess it actually changes i do a number of different things simply walking with my wife and sometimes my daughter will come along on her little bicycle
uh - huh
right
and then moving up i run in the mornings not every morning it probably averages about two days a week
uh - huh
right
and then with my wife i actually go to the gym and lift weights which isn ' t i understand quite exercising but it ' s along the lines
right
how about yourself
well that ' s a hard question to answer because i do physical things but i don ' t always set out for them to be exercise
uh - huh
i walk with my parents
occasionally nothing ' s real regular about this because i have a weird schedule and they have a normal schedule and
i play racquetball but i haven ' t since i ' ve been out of school i don ' t have anywhere to do that but that ' s going to start soon again and i play softball once a week which is it ' s kind of more recreation than exercise
uh - huh
uh - huh
because i really don ' t like to exercise i think that ' s the basic point of it is i ' m not i don ' t enjoy it if i know that it ' s exercise but if it ' s like a social activity or a recreational activity i don ' t mind
right
right
so i have to disguise it it ' s like feeding little babies food and telling them it ' s something else so that they ' ll eat it that ' s kind of the same thing for me i have to not know that it ' s exercise so i can do it
that ' s right
right so you look at it more as a as a task
well yeah if it ' s exercise it ' s a task i don ' t want to do anything i have to do
right
i see
i mean i ' ll voluntarily clean the bathroom but i won ' t do it if i have to do it
right so i ' m thirty two years old which is probably different than yourself
uh - huh
right i ' m twenty two
and so it ' s interesting that as you get older you begin to understand that you need to exercise in my job at texas instruments i have to sit in front of a computer all day and make phone calls so
right
that i don ' t get any exercise doing that and plus there ' s a build up of stress so i need to go out and take those walks after dinner and i need to go out in the morning and run or i ' ll just get nuts
right
uh - huh
right
so that ' s kind of a motivator so even though i can look at it as a task
the you know i kind of get the i get some kind of global benefit from the from the whole thing by saying well i ' m you know lowering my chance of heart attack and thus that type stuff
right
huh
eating right and no cholesterol and all that
sure that all i do all that
yeah we i ' m sure i will do i ' m doing that more and more than i used to i think i ' m getting
yeah
i ' m getting better about this knowing that i need exercise and doing it but it ' s still at the task stage
right
is it a pleasure for you or are you
hum
right
right
going to the gym is actually something different than the like oh and the running and i enjoy that too year i ' ve been running since high school you know on track teams and the like so
uh - huh
oh
running i i ' m at that point which you probably get to after about six months of dedicated running where you don ' t feel your muscles any more
uh - huh
right
and you don ' t think about the pain of it you take the time to relax some how and you think about other things during those first few months you have to think about running and why your elbow hurts and why you can ' t breathe and this and that and that ' s no fun and it ' s so hard to get past that for a lot of people
right that ' s i never got past that stage
yeah the weight lifting on the other hand is actually you know i think i look better
right
i have just a i don ' t i ' m not a huge person i ' m just a regular looking guy but just going to lift weights on occasion with my wife and my wife thinks the same thing about both me and herself that get that little bit of definition in your muscles is attractive
uh - huh
right
so that pays also
that ' s good
yeah so i guess that aspect of that takes away the work the with my wife which is nice i love her you know i enjoy being with her i guess that ' s one thing but also that long term benefit of a little bit of tone in your muscles
yeah
uh - huh
right that ' s it i do the occasional push up and sit up i haven ' t really brought myself to go to the gym because that ' s very stressful to me because i feel
yeah
i felt real competitive there and i need to find some place i could go and not feel like there ' s all these people who are just huge and hulking that are
but
oh yeah i don ' t i don ' t let that bother me but yeah that that ' s something that comes with time too you know i ' ll tell you the sit ups and push ups are excellent
yeah
right
uh - huh
you know it ' s your own you you ' re struggling against your own body weight
right
you can have variety by putting your feet higher or lower by putting your arms further apart or closer together by doing them real quick or real slow and you can actually get a good you can
right
i know in the push up at least you can get chest muscles and the back of your arms quite built up just doing push ups
uh - huh
that ' s a good idea but i do have my ride we have a stationary bicycle and a stair step machine here at the house
oh is that right
i ' ll do those once in a while just you know like at eleven thirty when love connection is on and i can ' t sleep i ' ll get up and stair step for half an hour so
right
yeah
right
that ' s funny
yeah
it ' s i guess pretty healthy but i don ' t have an a regular plan that ' s
yeah
i need to get started on that
well you know maybe not i ' d say i ' d say at twenty two you don ' t necessarily need a plan as long as you ' re getting the exercise otherwise
right
when your life becomes sedentary is when you have to make yourself a plan and what ' s real funny about plans is that there ' s a struggle between
uh - huh
uh - huh
and that ' s the hard decision is okay if i ' m going to run in the mornings what am i what do i trade it off for well the answer ' s sleep right if i ' m going to walk at night what do i trade it off for well star trek
sleep
uh - huh
or you know it it ' s always trade - offs and you actually have to as you get older you have to really think what can go and what to replace this thing it ' s i mean not just exercise but anything it ' s very hard
yeah
right
and so i don ' t i don ' t think you should worry about not having a program yet
that ' ll come some day when i
yep
yeah i guess if you care or if your wife your future wife gives you a reason to care which helps
right
well i hope so yeah sounds good
nice talking with you craig
well let ' s see
how many you said yours are all i mean that sounds like an army
five
oh lord
that is an army i came from a family of six
and i have only got two and they ' re one
well any number is nice let me tell you
well i kind of decided that single children that
that ' s not parenting that ' s a hobby but
yeah it ' s not as fair to the children either i don ' t think
oh
yeah but sometimes you can hurt them by having too much quality time too
well i can i can spot a kid who really you know whose parents spend every quality time with them you know outside of the work day and when i take care of some people ' s kids you know when they when they have teachers ' holidays and that kind of stuff i will take my friends ' kids
uh - huh
uh - huh
uh - huh
uh - huh
uh - huh
that are usually in day care and you can spot them because they have no idea how to just hang out and mess around
uh - huh
you can tell
how to just entertain themselves
yeah really
yeah
it ' s a problem for any child and you take one that ' s used to being
busy being having something to do all the time it makes a big difference
it ' s not a problem for my two they ' re only eighteen months apart
keeps you busy
they can
they can find things to do and mess around and
yeah
plot and scheme and everything else so you did all five of yours complete college
well that ' s great
no our last daughter she didn ' t want to go to school she ' s but she ' s married now they built a home just a couple miles from us and
well how did you go about selecting a college then
right now i feel the main thing is to look at what they ' re interested in and take what they ' re interested in and then start looking for schools
no not necessarily
and but like our oldest boy i think he would have he wanted to go to embrey riddle and we talked him into going local here first
uh - huh
uh - huh
and he would probably be flying is what he would be doing but right now of course he ' s working for pratt and whitney in connecticut and they build and rebuild jet engines
how about the other four other three who went
the other ones the second one she chose we let her go where she wanted to we didn ' t want her to go but she went to erie to gannan university or gannan college i ' m not sure which it is college i guess
she went there two years and it was more expensive and she soon realized you know even though she didn ' t like clarion she came back and finished at clarion
because it saved her quite a bit of money and she got really the same basic education that she wanted
uh - huh
and our other two boys they went to clarion also and did very well there
and they ' ve all really got
they ' ve all really got really good jobs
and
when they were like in junior high and high school i mean had they did they have an idea that they were definitely going to go to college and
uh - huh
yeah they kind of had that they just expected to go daphne never went she always said she would never go to college
she said i always thought she ' d change her mind you know but she didn ' t and there ' s nothing wrong with that you know if college isn ' t for everybody
uh - huh
but it does make a difference in your pay wage income i think it ' s what they want out of life
because if they get an education
and are willing to go where the jobs are
they can make a you know a much better income
uh - huh
like my kids they ' re all making more than my husband was making when he retired from the state
you know that boggles my mind
uh - huh
okay did you go to college
yes i went four years undergrad at university of nebraska at lincoln because lincoln is where my parents lived and there really
you did see it makes a difference
uh - huh
uh - huh
there really wasn ' t a choice i mean the finances dictated that you had to go there
uh - huh
uh - huh
i kind of i am not going to say i resent it but i was well one of the national merit scholarship qualifying and you know one of the rhodes scholars kids and the whole bit
uh - huh
uh - huh
uh - huh
my parents didn ' t even discuss with me going to college out of state or anyplace else and i just knew that the finances you know would not support it if i had known
someplace else
uh - huh
how not i ' m not going to say easy but how
much less difficult than i thought it would be to get a
uh - huh
would definitely you know have gone now when i finished there then i got a scholarship to go to the harvard university in boston and that was i think that was probably one of the best things that had ever happened i mean i was
uh - huh
that ' s great
taken out of my element you know the homogeneous midwest which is a lovely place to grow up and put into someplace else where people thought differently looked differently sounded differently
uh - huh
uh - huh
uh - huh
different life styles yes yeah
different life style and i think it was probably one of the best things that ever happened to me
uh - huh
uh - huh
i don ' t know you know what the realities is going to look like you know we ' re putting money away already but i really think it ' s important to put these children someplace where in addition to
uh - huh
you know them getting an education they really need a you know a socialization away from what they are raised in especially if you lived a pretty insular community and
uh - huh
right
an upper class suburb of dallas let me tell you
it ' s quite a bit different
it ' s very different
see that ' s the way we are we ' re more of a rural type of a area
and it does make a difference
i they say you shouldn ' t look at the expense of the college when you are looking
you shouldn ' t
yeah not really because they say a lot of times you - an get more help
uh - huh
with a more expensive college
oh yeah
and so in the long run if it ' s really what they want
you know they ' re better off now our children all pretty much borrowed for their school we did all we could
well
that ' s something yeah we have it ' s a very timely subject i think in the spring everybody decides that they ' re going to start over and do something with their house
and we started last year an we have a little i guess it ' s a sixteen hundred foot house and it ' s just my husband and i here but we decided that we wanted to build a sun room
and it ' s a good thing we got a contractor i mean this is not something you need to do by yourself so we ended up with a contractor and went through that whole schmeal with
the contractor saying one thing and then doing another and anyway we ended up with a really neat sun room on the back of the house it ' s beautiful it ' s like two hundred square foot
but that ' s not something we did by ourselves if you talk about home repairs tom ' s real good at mowing the grass and doing the garden so that ' s about it
isn ' t that amazing
yeah
and the water heater upstairs in the attic it had a little leak and leaked down in under the ceiling
and they had to come in and do some tape and bedding and repaint you know treat the ceiling but nothing major those kind of things really weren ' t major just some of those kind of things that can happen
yeah
but just getting him out there to finish up and that sort of thing was has been a real effort
all those little details that you don ' t really understand you know like we had some water leaks in the well in the sun room there was a part that was fiberboard
and you know tape and bed over that and when it did rain of course the only way to tell if this place leaks is to see if what happens after it rains
uh - huh
it ' s hard it ' s hard to make it fit perfectly
it ' s a chore and a half without tearing the whole thing out and repainting and doing everything again
well fortunately ours was on the ceiling where they had the blow in ceiling the little
oh
the little the little you know styrofoam balls that they paint over so it was easy to disguise that but it was in an area where you don ' t really look at very much so we were lucky in that respect
yeah
no however i do think that a lot of times contractors try to get out of doing things that they say they ' re going to do and
it
but you do
oh i know because every time they send somebody out they have to take them off a crew that ' s making money doing a job and they have to send them back to you where they ' re not making any money trying to repair something that you know should have been right in the first place
yeah and then they don ' t do a real good job doing it too they just kind of get it done as quickly as possible
yeah
well i was real happy with our contractor actually i wasn ' t happy with the contractor i was happy with the job foreman so i think that made all the difference because he was pretty you know
concerned about how it looked and you know how it should be done the right way and he gave us a lot of clues you just wish you knew all this stuff going in that
it was funny because we didn ' t understand a lot of things that we had to do in addition to this you know like the tape and bedding and doing finishing off this wall and that wall that wasn ' t in the contract you know kind of thing
so that was kind of interesting
yeah they i like when they come in of course i designed my own house i ' m i i ' ve had prior experience in design and building and stuff like that so i know basically if it ' s done right the problem is i don ' t want to do anymore
oh neat
oh
yeah
i want someone to do it for me
and just trying to get them to do what they say they ' re going to do is a real effort
yeah well we ' ve taken this another step further this year we ' re going to build a deck we ' ve got some people building a deck out in the back you know to complete sort of the back yard kind of thing and
well i could recommend something there if you know if it ' s not just cost prohibitive
oh yeah
for you i ' ve built probably three decks on three different houses
oh
and the first time i went with
regular just treated pine
kind of a womanized pine and then i spray treated it with some
uh - huh
panta oil which you have to do about every two years
okay
the problem with that is it warps after a couple of years then and you have to start replacing boards
i was wondering about that yeah
the second time i did it out of cedar which i soaked in thompson water seal
uh - huh
and that works fine but there again it discolors real bad
you soaked it
oh yeah
you know the sun and everything else it just makes it look gray and dull an and it doesn ' t look attractive after a few years the wood lasts fine but the color i was real dissatisfied
the color is what you ' re yeah sometimes after
and if you can stand the additional expense which you ' ll recoup after a while because it will last forever is the redwood if you ' ll go with the redwood
they ' re screws the self adhesive screws all right
yeah those and so they ' re not going to split and i was really concerned about bugs really when i when we were considering other types of wood because you know termites can be a real hazard around here
you have to pretty much spray them regularly you know under an and around or whatever so you want to leave yourself enough space to get under it or be able to lift it up
yeah
on some ends a lot of times they won ' t even detach them to the ground they just lay them up on some cinder blocks underneath in the ground
um - hum
and they ' re heavy enough where they won ' t the wind won ' t pick them up or they won ' t shift if it ' s big enough and heavy enough
so they ' re several ways of doing it but the redwood is by far the best and i would and i would also insist on that they do treat that with thompson ' s water seal
that
yeah that ' s the end part that ' s where you know get the
that ' s the part we have to do we got that up front we figured it out you know we need to know what we need to do that ' s not included in this and that ' s one of the details but that ' s fine as long as they tell you
yeah
yeah
it ' s so funny because tom is getting more and more adept at doing things it ' s just things like painting just always used to really scare me he didn ' t know where to start you know with a paint can you know an
well it is it ' s a frightening experience
the one thing you might do if he will deliver the boards that he is going to make the under structure with
it sure is
um - hum
before he starts doing the construction to go ahead and do the water seal
oh and do the water seal floor
on those and then when he cuts them and puts them together then that ' ll already be treated and a fast way of doing that if you ' ll go get a piece of guttering material like a little trough
uh - huh
and cover both ends or some sort of something that will fit in
okay
and
i got you covered there
pour that in pour the thompson ' s water seal in there and then just put that in there and turn them over several times and let them set and soak in
that ' s right that works wonders it i know it takes a lot of extra time but it ' s by far worth it
and that ' s just a water sealing and what happens if they aren ' t water sealed
well over a period of time any lumber will deteriorate
yeah will deteriorate yeah
now redwood would take quite a few years it depends on how many years you plan to stay there
yeah
but redwood even if you don ' t treat it properly will begin to discolor and will begin to degrade even though it will be strong structurally strong and will be there for a lot longer
yeah they did tell us that we ' d have to you know every couple of years just you know do brush up on the color
actually if you do the water seal correctly
um - hum
you don ' t even have to do that
oh really
i ' ve seen decks that are ten years old that still have never had the had the water proof stain put back over it or whatever
huh
and or they even have some rejuvenator that you can put on there that makes the redwood color come back but it ' s expensive and most cases if you do it properly it will not even be required
yeah and the thompson ' s is good because you can roll it on with a roller you can spray it on you can
yeah he suggested just getting a mop like you would use
or a mop anything you can put that on with anything whereas a lot of this other stuff you have to you have to actually sit down and paint it with a brush
a mop
paint it yeah
and or spray it but then you ' ve got to worry about the over spray whereas this stuff is clear
uh - huh
even if you got it on the side of some of your bricks or on your concrete it wouldn ' t hurt anything
you couldn ' t tell oh
you would never be able to know it so
well it it ' s kind of fun though things like that especially something like that where you ' re outside you ' re not worrying about something inside the house that you can mess up outside you can learn a lot by doing that
it is i
well like i said tom does great with his garden i always enjoyed working on the crew in the plays and building stuff so i ' m really in infatuated with building things and
well and it ' s and it could be cheaper in the long run and
well actually about six months ago we were but it was kind of a different type deal we had a large conversion van that and we ' re looking to sell it too
oh
uh - huh and did you were you happy with the van you
oh yeah as a matter of fact the reason we sold the van was just so that my wife could stay home with our two boys now
oh uh - huh
so we got rid of that big payment and so now she ' s a stay at home mom
right
did they use a lot of gas those vans
it did fairly well for me i got about fifteen sixteen
um - hum
oh that is pretty good
in the that ' s combination city and highway driving and then on the open road i can get about nineteen or twenty
oh that
oh yeah that is nice i thought they used a lot more gas than that ah
hum - um yeah you would think it ' d be a lot worse i know mini vans don ' t get much better than that they get about twenty one twenty two
no
yeah
ah
ah
a new baby and so the car that we have only has the five seat belts and we need you know when we ' re all going in it we need six
um - hum
yeah
so we ' re looking for something bigger and i
uh - huh
i don ' t know we have a little honda car that my husband uses
uh - huh
right and it ' s been such a good car but i wish they made hondas with the six seat belts i don ' t i don ' t think they make them that big
yeah i have looked at some of the toyota makes a real nice van i like theirs a lot
oh
oh
but if you really want size you know the prices are about the same depend you know you can spend as much on a mini van as you do on a full size conversion van
uh - huh
oh
and the difference is the conversion of course the mileage is a little bit worse
uh - huh
but because you do have a bigger engine and bigger transmission you can pull stuff like trailers and boats and stuff easier than you can with a you know the other mini van
right
oh
um - hum
oh yeah just lots and lots of vans
so that ' s i was kind of i my preference would to be just to go to a bigger car i think rather than rather than a van but you know even that is it ' s hard to find a car that is big enough i guess
um - hum
the problem we have now is our car it doesn ' t have a bench seat up front so if we had the bench seat then we would be fine but when we bought it we
oh it doesn ' t yeah
um - hum
we didn ' t get the bench seat up front so
yeah well i don ' t know if you ' d be how old is your oldest
eight uh - huh
eight yeah see i don ' t know how long you ' d be happy like that
well i don ' t know how often all six of you all will be in the car but i know that once you get one or two car seats in there
right
ah and then that yeah then you ' d have your eight year old you ' d probably have your eight year old up front on the bench seat
uh - huh
but even then after a while you ' d feel cramped especially if it was ah you know a fairly long trip in more than about an hour
that ' s true
that ' s true i haven ' t i haven ' t thought about that because is there a lot more room in the regular size vans than in a car
oh yes definitely you know a station wagon the back end of a station wagon probably can carry as much as a van but as for passenger space
ah you can ' t beat a van because you can you can you can carry seven in a van and that ' s a mini van
oh
uh - huh
on a large conversion van you can you know you can carry a lot you can carry about nine
oh so now why did you go with a large conversion van when you went
well because for what i wanted in a van the mini vans were about a thousand dollars less
um - hum
and you get almost twice the room in the conversion van than you do in the mini van
oh
oh
plus like i said all the extra pulling power and i didn ' t feel i was losing that much on gas mileage because they ' re not that far off
uh - huh
oh
right did you buy it new was it
yeah it was a new one uh - huh
oh and that ' s only about a thousand dollars difference
yeah i mean i was really surprised
yeah that surprises me too
because when you know you can like pick dodge for instance they got two sizes of mini vans one ' s the extra long and then the other the extra long option with all the power options you know windows locks and the nice stereo
um - hum
uh - huh
it was only about fifteen hundred less than the comparable full size van
my word
and you know like i said the mileage on a mini van is about oh twenty one twenty two on the highway and on the you know on the full size it was nineteen twenty
nineteen so that ' s still comparable
um - hum
um - hum
uh - huh yeah
hm
all of their entrees are wonderful have you ever heard of that place
where is it
uh - huh
uh - huh
yeah i was gonna say that
yeah there ' s another one over here real close to my house at walnut and shiloh but they ' ve built some more there ' s one over in the hurst area of fort worth and
i know i ' ve seen it somewhere
yeah
what is it is it what ' s it like just good food
yeah it is the atmosphere is okay i mean it ' s kind of dark and has candle lit tables and that kind of thing but it ' s not a real fancy place you know it ' s just the food is just really exceptional and they give you real big quantities
um - hum
and it and all their entrees come with like a salad and soup and all the rolls you can eat and so by the time you get your food you ' re already full
value and taste
oh well you could go there what i do sometimes for lunch is just get like soup and salad and eat their garlic bread because it ' s so delicious yeah
uh - huh
um - hum
i would love that i mean but you know that ' s what
except for the type of food that ' s kind of what i like
yeah well what ' s your favorite place
oh you like mexican i like that too
and i work downtown and so there are a lot around here and in
oh
yeah
oh you know like the knox central you know on the border i like for one kind of food and then there ' s the holes in the wall i like for another type
uh - huh yeah
and but what i look for is cost and yeah well i don ' t i don ' t know i don ' t like noisy restaurants either i that ' s why i don ' t go to on the border that much
well that ' s neat
yeah well that ' s my main thing too
yeah
yeah that is a real noisy place
yep and
and
i mean it ' s just i don ' t know it ' s a cavern you know it ' s just because it ' s so big and tall and a big room of full of lots of people or what
yeah
oh uh - huh
really i ' ve heard they ' re good
um - hum
oh yeah
extras and oh
so it ' s good yeah
that ' s what i like cheap and then but i but do you like to go out or do you eat at mcdonald ' s a lot or stuff like that
yeah
or yeah
right
so i spend time at those places too because i know how much they enjoy we go to show biz a lot but do you have children
yeah
no i don ' t but
so you ' ve kind of got to go there for playing for the kids and not for you
right that ' s right it they have a wonderful area to play you know they have big balls and games and rides and i mean all kinds of stuff it ' s like a little bitty amusement park in there
yeah
oh
good pizza i love pizza but i usually order that pizza is what i usually order you know at the house deliver it to me
uh - huh right have it at home yeah
and anything but domino ' s
yeah i know i don ' t like domino ' s either
oh that ' s wonderful i ' ve had their food before
so
yeah
yeah
yeah
uh - huh
i don ' t know that we have any big one down where i live in east dallas so it ' s
oh you do
is it northeast or
over by white rock lake
huh okay
i don ' t know how much i know about this subject
well i don ' t know if i know anything or not but i ' ve got some opinions on it see those type of people that have the most opinions ones at don ' t know anything
yeah
okay go ahead
well i ' ve had teenagers and i now have grandchildren that are teenagers and i don ' t know that it might do them a little bit of good to see the world from a different perspective
i think this me generation has gone far too far and the young people are overly impressed
and i think it wouldn ' t hurt them to step back from themselves just slightly and see things from a far more disadvantaged viewpoint
that ' s true
i personally know nothing about the peace corps though
me either i
i went to college and then started working and then got married and
but they have i read somewhere
and i ' m out on a limb here some type of college
volunteer work for teachers that they are straight out of college and they do one year of volunteer work teaching in the
lower income brackets of the united states have you ever heard about that one
no i haven ' t i know that my sister i have a twin sister and when she graduated she went to teach in a small town down in south texas and i know that like if you have college notes if you teach in
a lower income bracket where they don ' t pay as much and they cancel part of your you know your college note or whatever
oh really
um - hum
if it ' s like you know really a you know a lower paying job you know where in a small town you don ' t obviously you don ' t need as much as far as to you know to live
and this is money that she ' s borrowed for her college education
yeah she only taught there one year but i
but she got credits for it
um - hum
that ' s very interesting
and i think it would be i know that also one of my cousins who he is in like the therapy type thing and he was
some group paid part of his college income but then he was required to go back and work for a certain number of years in this town at
i mean it ' s a nursing home or something like that so you know if i think that that ' s a good way for people to you know maybe get people to come back to these small towns to work by helping
hum
people that normally might not be able to go to college and get the type of degree they want
yeah i think that is an excellent program i really do i like that and it ' s beneficial to the small towns too because they really
yeah
have a disadvantage that we don ' t understand because we ' re in the metroplex
as far as yeah getting doctors and all that kind of stuff yeah
right you know if we had some really major health problem that required a specialist we could find one it wouldn ' t be convenient
yeah
but we could find one we wouldn ' t have to drive and spend the night someplace or something like that
um - hum
yeah
so i can see the advantage to that one
the peace corps itself is really dying out isn ' t it
i really don ' t know that much about it you know i think of the peace corps you know more like the sixties and that kind of stuff when but yeah and don ' t they go into other countries and stuff
it ' s still in existence
i want to believe they go into other countries and teach them how to do things like farm
um - hum
dig their own wells set up their schools
things that make yeah make them more self - supporting yeah
yes they it ' s not
a program to teach them to use the american money it ' s a program to teach them to be more self - reliant
right yeah
and yes you ' re right i think it ' s a sixties program i think it was one of kennedy ' s hot points that he that was his big deal
but it definitely would give
a lot of the kids now that have everything given to them that they want to see
what it ' s like if you don ' t have all the money and can ' t have what you want when you want it
right
i think i i ' ve
singled out my grandchildren and but actually they ' re pretty good
um - hum
along those lines as compared to what i have seen from other people ' s children and grandchildren mine aren ' t really that bad but at the same time i think it would do them a world of good
yeah
but there ' s a
i don ' t i don ' t know that you could require everyone to do that for yeah to do it for a whole year or two years or something like that i don ' t know that would work if somebody ' s
mandatory just like the draft no
every time you
was didn ' t really want to be there and
didn ' t have yeah i mean there ' d be loopholes just like there is in anything else
they could buy their way out
right you know they they ' d figure a way around that one in a heartbeat but
i ' m wondering if there ' s another issue here and maybe this is why this has died out
can you go into and this wasn ' t the question but it ' s it may be the more of the issue versus should young adults
can they go in there and can anyone
go into
well out of the kurdish community is a little bit of extreme at this time but say i think bangladesh would have been a good example
or some really desperate situation and teach them to farm and teach them and doesn ' t do any good
yeah
i don ' t know that it does
i don ' t know that
yeah
if you step back from the current issue and look at it
more intellectually
there are forever over as long as we know there are races of people that are dropping out
you know we ' re losing certain races of people there are people now
um - hum
that are obsolete point and fact just like endangered species of animals so there are quote tribes of people
that are endangered or obsolete
um - hum
and i ' m just wondering if you ' re fighting a natural process there of being winnowed out there ' s a german word for it that ' s elegant but i never can remember what it was
but they ' re being winnowed because they ' re where they are they ' re not adapted to their environment
essentially
right yeah
and
one of the quick examples is the aborigines
yeah um - hum
when we were in australia
sad little things
i felt sorry for them
because their society isn ' t there anymore and their belief system and all their structured of theirs all the structures of their society are gone
essentially
yeah
and they ' re just kind of
more like a side show than anything else and that ' s sad but i don ' t think there ' s any way you could go the peace corps could go in and rescue those people and i don ' t think you could have done it fifty or a hundred years ago either
yeah
yeah
so i i ' m wondering if the peace corps is really an effective tool
well
and here with the peace corps we ' re talking about all these people that aren ' t even in our own country when there ' s enough people here that i think probably need help and could be helped
good point we ' ve got enough without a passport there ' s plenty
yeah
yes i think we ought to worry about our own species
and maybe rather than just require somebody to join like the peace corps for a year maybe like during college you know maybe have some kind of course where they ' d be required to do some kind of community service type work and
help people in that area or people in the united states
i wonder now in and i ' ve been out of school too long to answer this but i wonder if there aren ' t some sociology courses
there probably are you know for but i ' m sure that ' s probably like people that do that are the people that are going to go into social work and stuff but i think that it wouldn ' t really be
half bad for everybody not to do something you know and realize that it ' s everybody ' s responsibility
that ' s the last thing you want to do
money or
what was it they were bringing up points asking as far as whether they need to give
more money to these people i mean and that ' s not really the answer i mean because if they ' re alcoholics they ' ll just go out and spend it on you know booze or something like that but
yeah that ' s exactly it
they ' re not going to take that money you give them and go try to figure out a way to dry out with it now come on let ' s be realistic that ' s just not realistic
or you know to find a job where they can learn how to support themselves i mean
right
i guess we ' re getting kind of off the subject here but yeah i mean it ' s
no we ' re not i don ' t think i think that ' s more realistic than going making them go in the peace corps
true yeah
i think that ' s a lot more realistic
i think that we should be spending more time and again i don ' t think the peace corps is as successful now simply because
it ' s not
it doesn ' t fit the circumstance anymore
yeah
we ' ve got plenty
in fact we ' ve got far too many
flower mound yeah
so we ' re a little
yes
i try to whenever i can i ' ve always been a i guess a product of a handyman father
well i tell you what that ' s count your blessings because it ' s really is good when someone can do some
yeah
things to the car themselves
well that ' s why i don ' t do as much as i ' d like
right yeah
because they are i mean they got they ' ve gotten complicated haven ' t they
yes one of my first cars was a fifty six buick which after awhile i could you know take it apart in my sleep if i needed to
uh - huh
is that right
yeah it got to be pretty straightforward to understand and since then you know the closer a car is to a fifty six buick the more i know about it and then start getting into these nissans and the like and i just can ' t keep up
yeah
yep
um - hum
do i could always do the alternator you know and starter i don ' t anymore but i have on a lot of times
yes
yes i understand my last car repair actually had to do with brakes and it ' s one i did not do myself i took the car my i have a seventy nine el dorado took it to be inspected
uh - huh
and the parking brake failed so i got under there and messed with the that adjustment to make tighten it up and that didn ' t do the trick and i got there and tried to
uh - huh
uh - huh
it probably slipped loose - idn ' t it
but we well actually that wasn ' t even eventually the problem i did a lot of things that i did everything that i could think to do
uh - huh
and eventually i brought it up to a place called just brakes and it turns out that there ' s a the parking brake in the rear there ' s a there ' s disc brakes and the parking brake is a piston
um - hum
deal and because the parking brake hadn ' t been used in so many years the piston froze up so they ended up having to pound it out and one of them they
hm
oh
were able to get running kind of oiling it and playing with it and the other one they just it was just frozen solid so i ended up having to buy one and all total it was just under two hundred dollars believe it or not to get all that done
um - hum
well it really wasn ' t quite as bad as you thought would it was it
well it was a lot of money but
you had to have the help didn ' t you yeah
disposal is a problem
that ' s true that ' s true
right that i ' ve quit doing that myself and but one of the main reasons was the disposal of the oil you know
yeah
i think life now i grew up on a farm i don ' t what kind did you up in the farm
i grew up in well at that time i was in a trenton new jersey so and it was a suburb of trenton so i really had mixture of suburb and urban living
uh - huh
i see i see well little bit different i think though it was much slower and
yeah
much more self - contained
i think you ' re right it ' s interesting i ' m i work in a high school
uh - huh
so i ' m comparing my life when i was in high school thirty years ago to what i see these children doing
yes
and the pressures on the children you know you hear this as an excuse but it ' s true they are so much greater
unreal by comparison
oh i cannot believe what they ' re doing academically the demands on them
and i can see why children do drop out
yeah i think that ' s right i can remember as a child you know nobody ever worried about me wondering out at night and going where i wanted to go
i can see i can see you know
uh - huh
it wasn ' t it didn ' t occur to nobody to worry that anything would happen to me they were
and then you didn ' t you didn ' t have to lock your door
no
and a and some of these are urban worries but
it ' s a lot different all though i guess twenty years a go now in this area
things were similar because twenty years ago let ' s see it was after
it ' s not all that long ago is it
yeah twenty five years ago is when we had the washington riots the first rights we ' ve been having some problem now and it reminded me of that
uh - huh
yeah we were living in new jersey
uh - huh
in twenty years ago
whereabouts
in allendal
uh - huh
and i use to have to go over to patterson when those riots were going on at sometimes
uh - huh
i don ' t know though it ' s kind of hard to really know because of though the news media had those riots
kind of blown up out of proportion
because i went there many times and i never i never saw a riot
the washington riots weren ' t because i lived right downtown washington and what you saw is was what you got i ' m telling you
did you
that ' s what yeah well huh
yeah but you know it ' s it is interesting they ' re so many they ' re different kind of dangers that face young people now
and social pressures the pressures of drug is so much the prevalence is so much greater the kinds of diseases that you ' ve got out the
uh - huh
i mean the consequences is so much what ' s going on is so much more serious
yeah i think that ' s true i think that ' s true
then when we were younger
i think the other thing is that
we have taken some rather drastic turns in our in our education and the way we approach things as of
maybe starting back when i ' m number one you know and worrying about the self and not
seeing the consequences of the disintegration of the family
uh - huh
and there have been many things that have happened that have not encouraged
closeness of families and support
for young people that the kind of support that they need to help them take care of the things if you don ' t have some kind of
yes and
of basic belief or something down inside of you then it ' s very difficult to
uh - huh
to have anything to turn to when you got when you ' ve got something facing you like that
that ' s true
i also being involved in the school system see so many of problem children coming from their parents
children who will lie and cheat and you approach their parents and their parents are constantly justify them rather than to
uh - huh
right
now exactly
yeah
if you ' re not going to get reinforced by that at home
that ' s right that ' s right
and you can ' t make up in a classroom of one hour a day what ' s not been done for fifteen or sixteen years at home
no
that ' s right
oh
and you ' re get you get mixed signals so it ' s not always the school ' s systems
i think a lot of it is the families and
no there ' s so much more then that it starts very much deeper then that i think that too i see some flickers of
the way you were mentioning yeah
yeah
of
of good directions turning
but whether they ' re soon enough and fast enough i don ' t know it ' s just
course life is a lot more complicated too in ways
the kinds of jobs that people need to be trained for now
right
you know with farming being so mechanized people working on the family farm which was a traditional american way
uh - huh
if that becomes less and less likely factory jobs are so much more sophisticated
yeah that ' s right
and the kinds of knowledge that you know it it ' s requiring an increasingly sophisticated labor force and some people just don ' t have it it ' s
right
and there ' s so much so many people on the lower end of those who are going to be the drop outs and the
and you worry with you know the effects of
and the poor and the homeless and whatnot
the effect of drugs on the young children and the unborn children
yeah that ' s just another
yeah
it really is it ' s just it just is almost overwhelming sometimes when you think of
it certainly is
of the jobs that is out there to be done
well it sure is
in order to flip things back around the way they needed to be
it sure is
not that i really think that they were perfect ten twenty or thirty years ago but
it was a little easier though wasn ' t it
yeah just the volume makes a big difference i
that ' s
yes
as mother you know i use to think sometimes it ' s not so much
it ' s not so much the kids it ' s just the volume of it to try to keep all wash done and all the things done and you know and
yeah
and they all the things demanded of the mother too i mean i look at my mother ' s life
right
i mean she didn ' t work for a long time when i was very young she didn ' t drive
right and children ' s lives were simpler because mother was there somebody was there
that ' s right
that ' s right that ' s right
and when there ' s nobody there i always thought too that you know people worrying about going to work when their child when their children are little
and i and i think that ' s sad if they have to because they miss so much
but i believed after having a few teenagers that the worst time you could go to go work was when they were teenagers
they need you more as a teenager
isn ' t that true that ' s why i ' m working in a school system so that i ' m home when they ' re home
right it ' s not so much that they come to you every minute but it ' s that you are there when they need you
that ' s isn ' t that that ' s so true i find working in a high school
yeah
it ' s very helpful because it let ' s me be a little more tolerant and understanding of what people do
yeah
and it keeps me from being the old foggy but at the same time it also it prevents kids from try to go pull the wool over your eyes
yes i think that ' s true
as to what ' s come but that ' s the same i ' m home at the summers i ' m home with the holidays
yeah that ' s
i ' m home at three o ' clock when the children are at home or where home one is now a senior in high school and the other ' s in college
yeah
well
and it ' s it does it
but that helps a lot i have a daughter who just had a second job she needed need to work and she
opted to go into a day care center where she could take her children with her
uh - huh
and
and looked a long time before she found one that was laid back enough so they she would be able to interact with them and
that ' s right
well i ' m
but i think that ' s really important i don ' t think people realize how important it is
that ' s that is that is so true and it ' s not that always that the children always say something but every once in awhile they ' ll come up and make a comment
yeah
yeah
and you realize it ' s important that
yeah
yeah i think that ' s right what was what is your name again
well
linda lee uh - huh
linda
okay
and your name was
well i think probably that we ' ve just about
well i enjoyed talking with you
hello
hello
this is marilyn spivey richardson texas
marilyn it ' s angela
how funny
let ' s see now what do i do push
push one
push one okay hold on
okay are you there
uh - huh
well do you subscribe to any magazines
yes
which ones do you
soap opera digest is one
oh how many soap operas do you listen to
and
two mainly
oh and so you can keep up with when you miss with that
yeah well it was a special thing it i think it was like a free subscription
that you got to see if you ' d like the magazine and you would renew it at the end of it i never did but
oh i see do you subscribe to any others
but we take consumer
yeah i consumer digest
oh
now we do like that one
now what do you find out in that because i haven ' t read that one
it has all different kinds of tips on
like appliances and tv ' s and vcr ' s and cars
um - hum
just different things that you buy and what the latest items are out and stuff it it ' s real informative
oh uh - huh
and then people magazine
okay well i only subscribe to two one of them is people magazine
um - hum
yeah i ' d forgotten
yeah they ' re i ' ve bought it a couple of times that or one of the other ones like that one you know after reading the front page there will be something that just catches my eye and i ' ll go ahead and buy it
um - hum
because sometimes like you said not all of it is believable and if you use your own judgment you can usually decipher what is and what ' s not
well it ' s good light reading and since our business is at the house i when i ' m eating lunch i like to read one or the other you know comes in the mail once a week and that ' s what i read when i eat my lunch
do
yeah i don ' t i don ' t buy
i don ' t buy then at the store either i can ' t even remember the last time i bought one at the grocery store in a long time
yeah i used to years ago read like ladies home journal and mccall ' s and some of those but i
i just kind of stick to these two now but you know because they come to i do subscribe and they come once a week so you know they ' re and i don ' t really have time to read anymore
right
what don ' t you like about the magazines
you mean the two that i subscribe to
yeah
yeah
oh well now i guess i just pick out and read out of both of them what interests me there ' s an article about
something way out in the national enquirer or something i just you know i just don ' t read it i just read the ones that sound interesting to me usually about movie stars or famous people
yeah
yeah i
i don ' t like all the advertisements and some sometimes it seems like the magazines are full of more
advertisements than they are anything else
yeah now that that ' s true there is a lot of those i don ' t pay any i don ' t read those much either
i don ' t either it ' s just you have to turn all those pages to get finally to the story you were reading
um - hum
when it ' s interrupted
but i like people magazine too
yeah although it ' s getting rather expensive since on the last time i had to
yeah it is getting real expensive
i ' ll just buy the ones off the newsstand then once a month or something when there ' s something i ' m especially interested in reading about you know
yeah or get somebody in the neighborhood to do it and then everybody pass it through
uh - huh
okay so does your mother still take people magazine
they didn ' t renew their subscription because of that
uh - huh
yeah well i think we ' re just going to do like you said just take the ones at the newsstand that look interesting from now on because seventy five dollars for a magazine that ' s just that ' s too much that ' s
right
yeah
they ' re all so much more than they used to be years ago years ago i think people read a lot more magazines
yeah
but
i don ' t think people have time to read them anymore
well that ' s
it ' s just usually the newspapers and
and then they ' re off doing their own thing
that ' s true
weekends and stuff are pretty full and that ' s about the only time
people seem to read on the weekends
yeah
because mainly i i ' m like you i read books
uh - huh and it ' s more as i can think more people do i think just read books
more
um - hum
so
well let ' s see if you were going to subscribe to a magazine which one would you pick other than the ones that you are reading
i don ' t know i ' m i just i don ' t i ' m not that interested in the magazines it you know other than like people or this consumer digest and the reason why we got that one was
um - hum
maybe the other one there ' s one out that ' s that has to do with financial things like how to save money and what bonds and insurancers and stuff like that to buy that we ' ve got we had a
yeah
sample subscription to that one and that one was good too it had a the one that was a sample one had an article in there about college
saving for your children and what to do and what not to do and how much the projected cost was going to be by the time like you know mine reached college age and stuff
um - hum
yeah
and it ' s going to be pretty darn expensive and it was saying you know what to you know how you could go about putting
okay you want to go first
real mess i guess you must say
yeah sure is
yeah it is
of course you you ' ve had your fair share of that down your way too
oh yeah think
probably i guess it ' s pretty well wide spread nation wide but i think texas probably
the major or a good portion of it
no argument here yeah i think that now i ' m no financial expert but from what i ' ve read and heard
that makes two of us
yeah i think there were some regulations on loans that were lifted that allowed savings and loans to make
riskier
investments and of course oil was one of the main things that were invested in oil and real estate and of course when oil went south real estate went with it people were speculating in the future that
without anything to fall back on when prices on both of those went down
the major culprit with the oil crisis
well also in investments in oil ventures as well because it was predicated on a certain price per barrel
right
to recover the costs of the loan and when oil went from thirty dollars a barrel to
twelve dollars a barrel then that just wasn ' t any way to break even
yeah i guess that was the immediate cause
yeah
shoot i don ' t i tell you one thing as far as the way they ' re handling it i
i feel pretty strongly about this and that ' s i think they ' re over reacting as far as the actions taken against their the little guy the depositor the customers
yeah
i think they went way to far the other way in the spectrum
and on the other hand i don ' t
yep
know whether they ' re doing enough in the way of you know redressing the situation and bringing the real
you know the
the presidents of the banks and those people that are really responsible to justice on that
didn ' t they just put another thirty billion dollar band - aid on the problem last week or something
i ' m not sure i didn ' t
president approved some more money to bail them out
yeah it ' s going to be
it ' s your and my money that ' s doing that you know that ' s unfortunately
well that ' s true
of course it just adds to the to the annual deficit which adds to the overall debt of the nation
and at some point in time
yeah
it ' s either going to be repaid or just completely blown off
i ' m not sure which one is which i really think our whole financial institution is a house of cards waiting to collapse
yeah well i guess the hope is that they can find some way to muddle through and the economy recover enough to help get them out of it
yeah now i i ' m a staunch republican but you know for the last nine years i ' ve heard that we would grow our way out of out of debt
and after the longest sustained economic recovery in i don ' t know how many decades it didn ' t happen
and
i don ' t know what it ' s going to take to turn that around
that ' s a good point they
they got a little
a little hesitation in the recovery here and hopefully they ' ll rebound from that in a fairly short period of time
yeah i think ending the gulf war quickly was beneficial
uh - huh
definitely
let ' s see what were some of the other
other points she mentioned topic wise
do we think enough is being done to address it i
i guess it had some blue ribbon panels look into it i don ' t i don ' t remember exactly what their findings and recommendations were
it seems to me like they really haven ' t at least they haven ' t
if they ' re doing anything it ' s still pretty much not out in the open it ' s you know behind the scenes kind of
right
sure
panels or whatever you know committees or investigations
nothing
nothing that makes headlines that much has been done really i don ' t think
that ' s true although of course the last six months the headlines have been pretty well dominated by the persian gulf
yeah
maybe now that we ' re putting that behind us that we ' ll be able to address this in more depth
does tend to push that out of the front page
sure
well hey it ' s been real good talking with you
yeah this will be a first i usually end up getting told i got three seconds to wrap it up or five seconds or something like that
oh do they come on does something body come on the line and tell you to do that
yeah i think one time it was i think ten minutes was the maximum and another time it was ended by
oh
what ' s the
its capacity was short that day or something
yeah
what ' s the minimum is that like three minutes
i don ' t think there is a i don ' t know if there is a minimum
oh okay
so i ' m satisfied we covered the topic on this end
i think so too
nice talking with you
to let you know what i feel about drug testing i have my qualms about having the government or anyone else for that matter
testing randomly everybody across the board for various drugs however i am not against
right
testing those people who are in critical jobs for example airline pilots subway drivers you know people who are responsible for other people ' s safety
right
for a larger number than just their own personal safety
correct i just think that it ' s
yeah
unnecessary and really the medical testing facilities that are available now have been shown to have problems in the past as far as reliability is concerned
huh
and we have had situations here where people were accused of
utilizing drugs and it turned out they were on some other medication which was giving false positives
right
right and the same goes with you can eat poppy bagels poppy seeds
um - hum
and they ' ll come up as a as a positive for drugs as well
which is i you know i ' d just heard that just recently and i thought that was interesting
do you more or less follow on the same lines as i do or
yeah i do i have a little problem with somebody testing for drugs just in general as an invasion of privacy
but i do agree with you regarding people that deal with groups of other people that their lives should be they should feel a little more safe and there should be more of a safeguard
you know air traffic controllers airline pilots anybody that deal with the public in a
yeah i know that they were up here in new york
i ' ve noticed what they have been trying to do the governor here isn ' t thrilled with the idea and we have
uh - huh
various government officials here who basically don ' t feel that is a good idea for along the same lines but they ' re continuously clashing with the federal government which because of it ' s antidrug war
right
figures well since we ' re not really accomplishing much of anything internationally let ' s make big headlines by going out and being for mandatory drug testing and
within the community
of trying to really do something and through education and that
yeah
yeah they the federal government seems to be a lot more aggressive about this
that ' s
than anything else it ' s interesting that you find out with all these little scandals going on now such as in the house with the post office cocaine scandal
right yep
you know all that
well did you hear about the what was happening in the boston area
for i guess for about the past five they ' ve been testing babies for aids
oh really
but not releasing the information
yeah i
they were just testing to find out how prevalent it is in what demographic and segments of the population
but they weren ' t telling anybody if they did it when the results came up positive or negative they weren ' t telling anybody
well i ' m sure and also bringing light to the fact that they weren ' t getting parental permission for it
yeah
they were just doing this test
yep
courtesy of the federal government as time goes on because of the almighty rights of the employer to know every possible thing about their employees
yep
right
exactly they want to they want to be just above in that regard
yeah i don ' t know how much you ' ve had experience as far as in the newspapers coming across people who have gotten into trouble with the drug stuff here in rochester
no
in western new york there hasn ' t been a terrible lot but we of course hear about the subway drivers in new york city
yep
who slammed into someone and of course you know the airline pilots are rumored you know there are already rumors of rampant alcoholism now cocaine usage
hm
i got her for christmas from my family and back when we lived in nebraska i like to hunt and so
no right i had a for many years i had a dog that was part springer spaniel i just love them
loved her she was the greatest went through two generations of children in my family and was always very gentle
do you have a pet now
oh
what kind of cat is it
just i got him he was he was born in the wild like in a in a shed
uh - huh
and had never been in a building when i got him so he and he ' s he must be part cross part with some kind of desert animal because he ' s very long and lanky but he ' s a very tame spoiled house cat you know now that i ' ve had him for seven years
being born outside you didn ' t have any problems house training them
that ' s good
really big so lots of times he it he seems to get in fights and when he was younger i think he started them and now i think he barely makes it i think he gets beat up even though he ' s big because he ' s
sure
pretty much overweight and comes home with a few scratches now and then yeah
well we went to a cat show at the plano center here in town and we thought that we have a cat now but we thought well if we ever get another cat you know we ' d want something kind of unique so
we kind of looked around and they had everything from hairless cats to siamese cats and persian cats and we sort of fell in love with the maine coon cats
oh i ' ve seen them i
they ' re huge
oh
i ' ll be darned i didn ' t know that
yeah i just i think i ' m i think i ' m being accurate in the in the area of folklore but i ' m not sure
that ' s interesting we kind of like well my family didn ' t necessarily like them as much as i did but the manx is that the one that doesn ' t have a tail it sort of has a bob tail i kind of like that too but
yeah
yeah
well i ' ll tell you an interesting story about how i got my dog and then i suppose our five minutes will be up huh i
yeah okay
work for a university and i went to omaha nebraska to recruit students and i had some time off in the afternoon so i went to a pet shop
and i saw these little springer spaniels and so i decided well you know this would really be a nice dog to have so when i got back home to carney nebraska
hm
i had to go back the next week as well as a bunch of other people from the university and one of the people that we went with they were friends of ours and so
we got to omaha and i decided i ' d take my friend over and show him the dog and
so i got over there and she said oh that ' s too bad the dog has already been sold and i didn ' t realize it but this guy had somehow worked it out so that he got there a little bit earlier bought the dog and she was in the back room
and so that night we had a reception for some of the potential high school students or college students and
okay right now we ' re living in well it ' s me my wife and two young boys
and right now we ' re in a i guess it ' s either a zero lot line or a garden home
uh - huh
which you might call it so we don ' t have a big yard but when my wife and i first moved in it was just the two of us so it was enough
um - hum
and it ' s i guess what they call a story and a half because it ' s not a full two story
yeah
where you know everything on top is on bottom
so it ' s got real high ceilings on half the house and the other half is just standard sized ceilings
hm
and it ' s about a five year old house now
it sounds nice
oh yeah
yeah well you know these guys that gambled high lost big you know
yeah
that ' s true
and
exactly what happened to them
i ' m insulating myself from that problem i ' m building my own house
oh that ' s nice
and as i look out the window of my trailer i can envision
oh really are you doing it yourself
yeah
yeah i used to be a builder
wow
oh that ' s nice
and i retired about five years ago
oh i see
and started college
oh
so you know i decided this summer that you know we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials so i did
that ' s great
and see the state has a law that says you cannot borrow the money to build your own home
is that so i didn ' t know that
you can borrow the money to pay somebody else to build your house but you can ' t borrow the money to build your own
that sounds kind of dumb
hm
yeah
well
hm
as you know anything that involves the government is works half as well as it ' s supposed to costs three times as much right hence the savings and loan problem we have today
yeah that ' s true
but you know my home is fairly simple it ' s designed to be added on to
um - hum that ' s good
yeah
well i figure it ' s just me and my wife but you know i like to do stuff with my hands and what not so i ' m gonna have a shop
yeah
how big a lot do you got it on
ten acres
wow that ' s nice that ' s real nice
well yes it ' s really nice too because i can ' t see my nearest neighbor he ' s on the other side of a hill
oh
and my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon
seriously
that ' s pretty good
and well in the winter time i can see another guy but you know he ' s
um - hum
you know i can just make out his place you know
yeah
i got a thirty mile view to the east and about ten mile to the
north
yeah
and
oh that ' s pretty good
uh - huh
because the house has no heating or air conditioning
oh you don ' t plan on putting any of that in
well it ' s got a very small furnace and a i ' m use a wood burning stove as well but
uh - huh
yeah
in the house itself i ' ve been working inside you know these low these many months and i have not had to use the heat
um - hum
wow
because it ' s all geothermal
yeah that ' s pretty good
and with all the see i ' ve got on the south side is all glass well as much as i could get in it you know
yeah
and the east side is glass i ' ve got one two three four five six windows in the east side on forty eight feet so it ' s almost all glass
wow
and
oh yeah i mean you know
she loves lots of windows
there ' s no place in the house where you can stand and not see four windows
so
is it a single story
well not really it ' s on the side of a hill
oh i see
so the first you know the what i call residential level at the side that ' s in the hill is about four feet deep
um - hum
i see
and the side that ' s on the other side is about six feet high
oh
so i got a pretty good grade there and then when i put the verandas which will be twelve feet out all the way around on the north south and east sides that will define the shop
yeah
um - hum
so
exactly yeah
yeah i i ' ve always liked that the you know i we don ' t have much yard but i built a small deck in the back but you know i see these magazines where you know do your own decks
um - hum
um - hum
okay
okay
well what ' s your favorite tv program
uh - huh
pretty much i like the thirty minute sitcoms in the evenings i mean i don ' t i don ' t get to watch them a lot but i do watch murphy brown and designing women
hm
so what do you watch
oh yeah i love it but it comes on so late
i tape it and watch it the next day yes
right
well that they ' re doing it saturday nights now um - hum
oh really what at the at ten thirty oh well i ' ll have to watch that then
ten thirty
hm for an hour i mean
yeah
glued to i watch some of the anthologies if they ' ve got something interesting on like masterpiece theatre or
yeah
mystery or something like that yeah
oh really yeah channel thirteen had on a thing about astronomy that was really neat but i didn ' t get to see all the parts
yes we saw we saw several of those not all of them
huh
only the new one i never really was interested in the old one and so but i like the cast of the new one so that ' s what we watch
oh
yeah
well that ' s pretty neat yeah i don ' t even know when that comes on anymore
saturdays
oh really hm well we go to the lake a lot so when i don ' t get to see it that much tv in the summertime and plus everything is in reruns anyway so i guess it works out
um - hum
true that ' s true i i ' m a very selective watcher i look at the tv section and
yeah
let things catch my eye
oh yes
oh yes and also i don ' t know how old they are but there ' s nickelodeon
oh yeah i love nickelodeon but they get that but where they live they live out in the boondocks of oklahoma and they don ' t get the disney channel
oh well they would enjoy that
um - hum so would i
i wouldn ' t admit it to anybody normally
oh really yeah it was neat
i mean forty here twenty years later you understand yes because he ' s he plays the phantom of the opera now and
oh i didn ' t realize that
yeah
yeah
i like old movies i love musicals
oh i do too i mean i ' ve got high society on tape that i taped and you know all the older ones
um - hum
um - hum right
oh i know
sit back and watch the old musicals
i know i keep a little a little a little library and if i get stuck i can resort to my little library in all sorts of things
oh yeah because that does happen a lot there is nothing on anywhere on cable or anything
it ' s surprising with all the choice we have sometimes there ' s no choice
i don ' t know i got kicked off the other day because they said the lines were busy
hm
yeah
right
okay
i get almost all well the majority of my news from radio and news letters which is kind of unusual but it ' s a pretty cost or time effective way to do it because on tv you have to put up with all the happy talk and the commercials
yeah
and then on like newspapers well they just take too long to read i use to read news papers very faithfully but i just ran out of time so i tape record all things considered from national public radio
right
and i when i ride the bike ride my bike to campus i have it on my walkman and that gives me one side of the news and to get the other side i get a bunch of news letters from organizations which are mostly on the right
uh - huh
oh okay
and how about you
that ' s interesting i ' ve never heard of the news letters angle i ' m also an all things considered person weekend edition whatever
um - hum
um - hum
i generally enjoy it although sometimes they have a tendency to do twenty minute features on things i ' d just had soon not hear for about two minutes
hm
all the all the aids cases in miami for example
yeah
yeah exactly
yeah that ' s right well i mean the only thing about them is that they the their news
most of the time tends to be pretty slanted to the left and you just can ' t tell really what ' s happening for i mean take for example the economy where they ' ve not them alone but
most of the news media but probably they more strongly than a lot of the others
have all these programs about bad economic news and as soon as the news gets good it just disappears you know just don ' t report it to the same extent that they do about the bad news
yeah although i think that ' s probably true of most news coverage in general good news isn ' t news right
hm i don ' t know but i think that for example after the
after the iran iraq war when oil prices came way down i think it would have been news that oil company profits decreased as i ' m sure they did you just didn ' t hear about it
right
so i get pretty upset with them actually a lot but the only thing is there ' s no other game in town except for monitor which is you know about the christian science monitor program
yeah on television or radio
no on radio they have an hour a day news program
but that ' s
yep oh excuse me i was just going to say up here they broadcast that i think between five am and six am which is a little before i get up so i usually miss it
i ' m sorry
right yeah that it i don ' t think they well i mean i know they don ' t broadcast it here at all and the only way that i can ever listen to that is when i ' m in another part of the country so
right
you know i mean they ' re really the only game in town and if you want to get different news for an hour or a little bit more than an hour that ' s
that ' s about the only way to do it which i find kind of unfortunate now there is the mcneil lehrer news hour but that ' s on tv and then you ' ve got to be sitting there
yeah like you i rarely spend time watching news on tv the
i gave up on network news years ago and it just doesn ' t usually work out i have time to watch something more in depth like mcneil lehrer so
yeah
for me it ' s pretty much a diet of
all things considered and i like to look at the wall street journal at work which i think does a fine job it too has a slant but
um - hum
yeah well at least it ' s not the same slant is all things considered huh
yeah exactly and
so that ' s true yeah now i like the wall street journal if i subscribed well let ' s see if i subscribed to a newspaper i probably would get it it ' s it ' d be that or usa today but
they have good in depth articles mostly on things that have to do with you know credit cards or other things relating to financial things or financial planning but they also have some good in depth articles beginning on page one
yeah i think what is it the fourth column of page one is kind of famous in it ' s own right just for human interest stories or business interest stories i
um - hum
right
i was discussing actually one of those stories with i just happen to i don ' t know how i acquired a wall street journal it just happened last month there was a story on recycling i think actually that was a column one story though
um - hum
but that talked about the way that some communities are trying to recycle so much that they don ' t have anybody to buy the stuff from them to reprocess and in one locality i think it was portland ended up burning
the stuff some of it some of it because there ' s nothing else they could do with it
right back to square one
yeah
so it was it was you know good to find out a little bit more than you would in certainly in any story on network news i mean not just
in order to go into this sort of specialized curriculum where we ' re teaching kids
not a broad base of subjects but rather trying to concentrate them on particular subject areas that they think they might be interested in going into a career
about and the problem comes about if these people aren ' t well rounded students or graduates that sort of traps them in the field that they ' ve spent all this time being educated in
i think there ' s something to that yeah i tend to agree
well i remember now it ' s been quite a few years since my kids were in high school i ' m getting that old but i remember being a little surprised at the
the catalog of courses like instead of taking a survey course on american literature you had you chose from it almost looked like a college catalog
uh - huh
and the courses were too specialized as you said
yeah that ' s it ' s i ' m only twenty four years old so i ' ve was through a lot of that although
you ' d be about the same age as my sons yeah
and they drilled into our heads and the same thing with the college that i went to get as broad of an education as possible so that you ' re down with the basics and then once you know what you want to do then
try and get some specific courses but i remember one of the things that they were always drilling into us was the need to learn how to communicate effectively through writing
uh - huh
you know it ' s some of these things that and i ' ve seen papers that in sixth grade i wouldn ' t have had returned to me which are getting a ' s in college today the standards have really fallen
uh - huh
yeah i taught college for awhile not recently but
huh
the writing they what they would do is they would focus in on our particular problems on the college level course and
uh - huh
would then work with us as far as fixing those things i had a problem with writing excessive verbiage
uh - huh
in my writing and i they taught me basically how to pair it down a little bit and i don ' t see that in a broader
you know even in a public school situation because a lot of the teachers have these large classes that they can ' t devote the individual attention to each student that they may have twenty or thirty years ago
uh - huh
yeah i guess the class sizes are bigger now i guess they must be
i remember large group in certain courses mainly political science we ' d have lectures where there ' d be three hundred students
uh - huh
and if you had a question you know or didn ' t understand it at all of course you ' re not going to raise your hand in a three hundred group
no
right they need smaller discussion
and i think you know it ' s those kinds of things that
i i ' m not sure how we go about fixing something like that other than maybe devoting some more
resources into first of all getting the teachers reasonable salaries and expecting in return some sort of standard
and you know some proof that what they ' re doing is actually worth what we want to pay them
yeah
and then try and get maybe more involvement with the parents
so that ' s probably one of the big keys
okay
well you know this is my first trial
is it
too
it takes some getting used to
yeah
so
do you have any ideas that you could offer me on a dinner party or whatever
every time i have a dinner party lately we just barbecue hamburgers so that ' s good
barbecue hamburgers
that ' s that you know pretty straight forward and simple
yeah
yeah
i ' ve
my worst dinner was
a cordon bleu chicken or chicken cordon bleu
um - hum
i made that one night for guests it just took forever to cook
yeah sometimes you know the time consuming stuff can be the worst things to go for especially when you have a group of people
right
right
i usually stick mainly with something i can put on the grill usually i ' ll get a
uh - huh
uh - huh
and put them on skewer sticks
well that sounds that ' s good too
i usually marinate them for overnight or something like that so that all the juices and stuff you know soak in real good
what do you marinate them in
i usually i use a combination i i ' ve tried this on several things but i use a teriyaki sauce
and i use a little bit of a good red wine
uh - huh
and put a little sugar in there and a little worcestershire sauce
and garlic and pepper
and then i mix all that up and then i just soak the meat in it i put it in a bowl where the meat is totally submerged in this marinade
uh - huh
and i usually keep it in there about twenty four hours
huh
and then i just when i get ready to cook them i just put them on the sticks then and then i put a little bell pepper a little yellow bell pepper between each piece of meat or every few pieces or whatever
yeah little cherry tomatoes or something
yeah or just you can just you can use your imagination on that kind of stuff
yeah
then i marinate mushrooms the same way i use the same mixture but i just add i add a little butter in with the mushrooms and saute those to kind of
um - hum i love mushrooms anyway just to
put over the steak do what
i love mushrooms just about any way
and it it ' s real good my wife likes it real well i ' ve i do most the cooking in our house anyway
that ' s neat
it ' s just something i ' ve enjoyed doing over the over the years and usually i ' ll just i ' ll serve something like a salad and some potatoes i take new potatoes and i ' ll steam those
uh - huh
i ' ll leave the peel on them and steam those and then i ' ll pour some frozen peas
some frozen what
frozen peas
oh okay
and i ' ll steam those just after just when the potatoes are about done i ' ll put those in there with it and steam those with them at the same time
and then pour them into a bowl and mix butter in there with those that ' s real good
and then just a regular salad of some sort
and usually everybody you know that usually everybody likes that some of those types of combinations
uh - huh
then some kind of dessert whatever and usually wine or beer or whatever
well what ' s your best meal to cook though your best simple one
my best simple one
yeah one that you when you ' re in a hurry for a decent meal
let ' s see probably
stir fried beef
uh - huh
i usually do that in a wok it ' s real fast you can you can do the whole thing in probably thirty minutes
yeah have you seen that wok on tv
is it is it the electric wok or the one that you put on top of the burners
no
the one you put on top the burners beat out with the hammer
oh i know yeah i know which one you ' re talking about now what i actually what i use is my wife is oriental
uh - huh
and we ' ve tried all that stuff the only problem is it ' s so messy the cleanup from all that takes twice as long as what the cooking does
uh - huh
so we just use we have an electric wok
and it does it does as good as anything
you like the electric one then
yeah they ' re easy to clean you know they have the nonstick coating on it and then i also
have a rice cooker you can buy a rice cooker and it cooks rice perfectly except you have to buy the rice in an oriental store because it takes a special type of rice
right
does your wife do her own oriental cooking though
no i do that too
she likes it so - so
i she usually tells me what she likes and she ' s taught me how to do some of her things over the years
she probably she probably doesn ' t care for much for the greasy stuff
no she doesn ' t she likes hot spicy stuff so i ' ve learned to cook a few of her the type meals that she likes egg rolls and things like that
she doesn ' t
hum
i ' ve never tried egg rolls
they ' re not really that tough after you after you do it about two or three times the first few times learn how to wrap them and everything else that that ' s really the key it ' s what goes in it is very simple
well what goes in them i mean
i usually make mine with pork
um - hum
chopped pork and chopped shrimp mixed and then i put you know mushrooms and carrots bean sprouts cabbage
then
well just about anything can go in the middle
just about anything actually
right
well what do you make the dough out of
well those you the wraps come already premade in the oriental store and they ' re called egg roll egg roll wraps
oh okay
it ' s made out of like a wheat paper
hum
and you just put the stuff in there in the middle you just take a spoonful of it and put it in the middle kind of form it you know like a tube
uh - huh
and then kind of roll it up and wrap the edges around it and roll it up all the way and then put a little bit of egg
the egg white
uh - huh
raw egg white on it and hold you know hold it you know in place
brush it or
do what
brush the egg white on there
well you can just take you know that little spoon or whatever and just take a little on the edge of it just rub it on the edge of it and then tighten it
you can even just dip a little flap of it in there it doesn ' t really make it doesn ' t take a whole lot
huh
but it ' s then you just deep fry them until they ' re done
and that should just you have to kind of taste one to see you know see if it ' s done or not
right
but
there ' s all kinds of neat little stuff i mean i enjoy it i just i get in the kitchen sometimes just try new stuff and if it doesn ' t turn out very good i just don ' t do it anymore
your kids have you noticed how kids won ' t eat tomatoes out of anything
do what now
cooked tomatoes my little boy would not eat cooked tomatoes
oh really my daughter loves that stuff
well if i make spaghetti
um - hum
well you know not many people put you know put tomatoes in their spaghetti sauce i put them in there all the time
uh - huh
oh i put them in there i like
i love i love tomatoes in there i usually buy these
well
oh they ' re cans of these diced tomatoes
canned whole tomatoes or canned
yeah well they ' re actually they they ' re canned tomatoes but they ' re they call and they dice and they ' re small
yeah
they ' re peeled
and then they have other stuff in there with them green peppers and stuff i just toss one of those in there
oh you talk rotel tomatoes
do what
rotel tomatoes
they ' re kind of like rotel but i can ' t remember their what brand they are they ' re
rotel ones are sweet
okay
well i just buy those california peeled tomatoes
yeah same sort of thing
yeah
then i just you know put whatever kind of meat i use sometimes i use italian sausage or you use ground beef or i ' ll even make sometimes i ' ll even make the meatballs
yeah if you take that sausage that tube sausage and ground it up
uh - huh
it ' s good
yeah
the italian sausage
and put it in with the hamburger it just gives it a better flavor
oh i agree it ' s good
well in kentucky we call it hamburger you all always call it what
meat
yeah
well i ' ve i don ' t know
tube meat
i use deer sausage too
i know i love deer steaks
venison oh
i make the tube deer sausage every year and i even cut it up and do the same thing
that sounds good well you must be really into cooking i ' m not much into it
well i mean i ' m if i have time i am if i ' m if i ' m if i don ' t have time or i ' m in a hurry i can ' t stand it i ' d rather just go out to eat but if i ' ve got a saturday afternoon or sunday afternoon i like i like to plan something and do it
um - hum well
but
in texas usually not in kentucky we didn ' t do it much but
you all want to cookout everyday here
cookout everyday
well it seems like every weekend we ' re somebody ' s got a cookout going on here
in texas i ' ve only been here about a year or two
oh yeah
well i use see i use my outside grill probably three nights a week
well see that ' s a lot in kentucky we use them maybe once or twice a month
that ' s
i used to not use it so much but when i got my gas grill i used it a lot when i have to fool with charcoal i don ' t want any part of it
uh - huh
that electric i mean gas grill i love it
oh i just like the taste of stuff cooked out on a charcoal grill though
well i put these i do throw a couple cubes of charcoal you know this
and hickory chips and stuff like that in there which does give it the appearance but i just i like the i like to be able to push the starter and have it light up
uh - huh
uh - huh
uh - huh
uh - huh
because it smokes real a whole lot and that smoked flavor gets up into the meat
well that ' s good my stepdad my dad my well lord my husband ' s father is he ' ll smoke meat oh and he makes a good smoked ham and stuff
it ' s going to be a hard one huh why
yeah i think so i don ' t know well i ' m not one in finances first of all and but i do try to keep a family budget what about you
uh - huh
you know it ' s
well that ' s the way with us that ' s why i said i try to keep one with my husband isn ' t working and yeah and it makes it real tough you ' re right
oh is that right that makes it real tough
huh so how do you how do you make ends meet and how do you make sure that your bills are paid and
well i rob peter to pay paul i pay the utilities and the most biggest bills at the first of the month
yeah
uh - huh
and then i look buy the groceries and the smaller bills like middle of the month but i have it exed out to last me for the whole month
and he works contract work occasionally so that helps he ' s an electronics engineer an electronics engineer
huh
what does he do
a what
uh - huh
and he works mainly on aircraft and he was working with eastern and eastern went bankrupt
oh is that right
so yeah so
well that ' s tough yeah especially these days when the economy is so bad yeah i work on commission and
he said he
yeah
and that makes it tough too because i you know you can ' t you can ' t always budget what you know you can ' t have the same budget every month because you know
that ' s true
what kind of work do you do
i am in the roofing business commercial roofing business
oh uh - huh
and so you know i may do real well this month but next month it may you know may not rain at all and we not have any work so
that makes it really hard too
it makes it really hard to set any budget and you know
so i guess it ' s
you know each family has their own way of doing it i do it about the same way you do you know we pay what needs to be paid
so that we don ' t you know we don ' t have the lights turned off or have the water turned off or the phone turned off
do you ever try to hit a long shot like in lottery or races or anything like that
have it to do it right hm yeah
publisher ' s warehouse i never send those either but i thought well maybe you do have a chance after all
uh - huh
yeah
but
problems that we have you know are things that we kind of brought on ourselves because we kind of overextended ourselves of couple of you know few years ago with
um - hum
credit cards and stuff and then the economy went bad and you know i was out of work for a you know for little while
and you know been on commissions for you know few years and it ' s just
we just never got caught up so do you own your own home
yes we do
yeah well we do too and that makes it even tougher because you know we tried to put our house up for sale
yes
and the economy ' s so bad we couldn ' t sell it
yeah well when we bought the real estate was really high and now with the last appraisal we got and everything it really went down so that if we would ' ve tried to go on a market we ' d have lost money
yeah well we did too
yeah well we got we you know all we asked out of our house was the note
uh - huh
and shoot somebody came and offered us we would ' ve lost twenty thousand dollars on our home
you know if we were just to sell it
um - hum
and so we decided to keep it and kind of just
i ' m trying to hang in there
yeah try to make things work
does your where - oes your wife work
she doesn ' t i mean she actually she does she actually probably works more than i do but she does sewing and hair and stuff at home
oh
and so the only you know i guess bright
thing that we have to look forward to is that i own part of the company that i work for and so that ' s kind of helping us out you know it ' s making things a little more
you know about computers
you are
um - hum
well good you can talk about it more than i can i don ' t own a computer but i ' m in college right now and my boss has an ibm that she has me type letters on a lot and i do a lot of merging with addresses and letters and
oh
oh i see
that ' d be handy in college
huh well so what word processing program do you use on that machine
wordperfect
ah okay yeah that ' s the most popular one
uh - huh
yeah i use microsoft word which is the second most popular one
partly because
oh i live and work right near microsoft and it ' s just real handy to call them up for help or anything kind of a local product
uh - huh
uh - huh
oh
uh - huh what do you do for a living do you use it in that
well just for a little bit of typing and stuff i work for i do tech support for a company that makes telephone equipment
uh - huh
oh
and so i use it for
oh memos and for communications i have a modem on my computer
uh - huh
i use it for electronic mail and for sending faxes
oh
hum
uh - huh
oh i see did you get it put back together
so i panicked called the main office borrowed their ' s so i could go ahead and print out the documents
hum
hum
did it take glue
did it take glue
oh well that ' s good
you were probably in a bit of a panic
huh
so what school do you go to in
oh tyler okay
but i ' m interviewing i interviewed i had an i ' m a music major and i had an audition yesterday at baylor university it ' s a private baptist christian school
oh really
um - hum
in texas in waco and so that went real well
well my roommate ' s a music major
oh really
and i work with seattle opera
oh my goodness
when i ' m not working as an engineer
oh a bit yeah i actually got into opera through an interest in acting but i ' m getting more interested in singing
oh my goodness
so yeah i ' m in about four operas a year up here and we ' re i just finished ballad of baby doe
that ' s great
uh - huh
which was written in the early fifties by douglas moore
uh - huh
it ' s a true story of a couple in colorado in the late eighteen hundreds who became fabulously wealthy from
uh - huh
right
and
and then before that i was in the nutcracker with pacific northwest ballet i ' ve been doing that for a number of years playing the grandfather in the party scene and then before that i was in phedalio which is the only opera ever written by beethoven
uh - huh
oh my goodness
so it ' s a lot of fun
well did you take music classes in college
well i no i didn ' t but i ' ve started voice lessons recently with a woman who ' s a principle singer around here for
she ' s in a usually in a couple of operas a year
well my goodness that ' s wonderful i hope
so yes so my roommate candice in music department at university of washington and she ' s
uh - huh
so does she want to do that or does she want to get into opera
well where i ' m from the atlantic coast conference is a very big conference and
course we have duke university that was the national champions last year so i ' m kind of hoping that they ' ll repeat again this year they have a lot of the same players back
now we talking about is this the nba this is college okay
no this is college basketball right we have like carolina and duke and georgia tech and nc state
teams that are normally ranked in the top twenty
um - hum
and see that ' s probably all i like saw while i we have moved in the last couple years from utah to texas and there ' s so many colleges and universities in texas we haven ' t really
do you like professional basketball
the mailman or karl malone was you know pretty big thing and the lakers have always been amazing to watch
yeah
no i did keep track a little bit of the mavericks they ' ve
not had any good seasons for a long time and have a lot of problems with tarpley and maybe now that that ' s over they ' ll come out of it but
well that ' s an up and coming team though
yeah i hope they do something they need to or they ' re not going to have any esteem left at all
that ' s somebody you can get behind and be patient
yeah kind of like the cowboys i guess
yeah they seem to be kind of not having a very good few seasons
yeah they coming out of it this year we ' ll see if it holds on
but i think chicago will probably win the nba again
the bulls
yeah
that ' s true
yeah oh my atlanta braves
well they did well
it ' s yeah
it is it is and that ' s why i ' ve i guess my mind went blank it ' s like last season was so long ago and i haven ' t really even started thinking about basketball yet so
yeah
but this wasn ' t a good subject but we ' ll see how our predictions come true
it ' s a little early
we definitely will
okay it ' s good talking to you
well
i think that when you ' re tried by a jury of your peers they probably the collective
mind of the jury is probably a better vehicle for sentencing than the judge himself because then there ' s the consensus thing rather than a single person
well there is an argument in that a judge has seen a lot more cases and you know perhaps he sees one crime
um - hum
and he can compare that crime to you know his long history of dealing with criminals and
um - hum
the jury you know this is you maybe they ' ve sat on sat on a jury once before maybe this is their very first time the only they ' ve really seen is like gaudy on tv or something like that you know and they just you know they just kind of
um - hum
you know making guesses how bad they think it is
yeah well i would i would argue back that
a single person being able to pass a sentence on someone leaves it open to his or her own biases and they may consider
arson to be a heinous crime and child molestation to be less severe so the sentence wouldn ' t be all that uniformed i mean obviously it would be uniform within the parameters of that judge him or herself
yeah as uniformed i mean he would he would
figure out the severity based upon his own personal scale the only thing i worry about is like one
one murderer or let ' s say one thief
getting like
a tenth of the penalty of another thief simply because perhaps he impressed the jury more or you know just because his presentation was better
uh - huh
yeah that ' s a that ' s one of the biggest problems i think in our society is that the justice system
basically goes by who ' s got enough money for the best lawyer and the presentation is everything so you know you could have a real dirt ball
yeah
be portrayed by his lawyer as a loving family man and color the color the jury ' s opinions but i don ' t know
exactly
see i would almost argue i would consider i don ' t i don ' t know i haven ' t thought it out long enough to figure out all the ramifications but getting rid of the entire trial by jury and having the judge decide guilty or not guilty
well we could do that or we could explode it to it ' s logical extreme or it ' s or
ridiculous extreme and
take the new interactive television
technology that ' s coming forward and have everybody in the country or everyone who chose to tune in
passing sentence especially in a more involved trial
i don ' t know i think that the founding fathers had a great idea and the reason that we went away from the single judge or the triad i guess of judges that they have in some systems it just
you know they become instruments of the government and
yeah but i think the we the people that our founding fathers were talking about were rich white males
i mean i don ' t think
i don ' t think they had a real high opinion of the masses i mean hamilton was a prime case you know he didn ' t i think he referred to them as the mindless he didn ' t want them to vote he didn ' t want them to have any say in government
oh yeah that ' s why they made election days on tuesday in november you know tuesday was a work day and november was a real pain to travel in november back in what seventeen eighty three
right
you know that never occurred to me
well i mean only one it seems like a needless step but i think there ' s only been one person who haven ' t voted as he was voted into or there ' s only i think only been one electoral vote that was not voted at in the electoral college
um - hum
as the propular the popular vote was voted
i really don ' t know enough about the middle east to form solid opinions but i don ' t how about you do you have a solid opinions on us involvement
well i think it ' s been interesting to hear you know about the overall outlook you know before we ended the war what implications we ' d be dealing with you know the
uh - huh
strong religious beliefs and you know it ' s just another
attitude you know and what we are really getting into and the fact that war you know coalition forces stuck together and
totally different world
you know i just think now is that they should have finished saddam off because i think
we ' re just going to see repercussions down the line because he ' s he ' ll probably maintained power it sounds like he ' s you know knocked down the revolt you know so
hm
so you ' re saying that the coalition forces should ' ve got went ahead and gone in and taken out iraq instead of just recapturing kuwait
or at least got saddam
yeah and well bad thing is i mean you can ' t do that because the saudis asked you know the saudis were helping you know out
you know if they you know if they
on only under the condition that they would help that the united states and the coalition force would help kuwait regain their country
yeah no i don ' t think i don ' t i don ' t think a lot of them didn ' t want him to lose you know power completely but it ' s hard to say
and otherwise
right
and plus you know it ' s illegal you know in
in warfare or any or any other kind of international
yeah to go to go after the political heads of state but
to go against the to exactly you can ' t go after the leader you can ' t legally do that i mean then again you know there ' s people who say war is war everything ' s fair
yeah
but that ' s just not it ' s like some you know a geneva convention or something like that said it
yeah but
anyway but now it looks like you know kuwait has asked us to defend its borders more of a permanent type of basis which will be a first
uh - huh
yeah
so it ' s interesting
but
yeah it ' s but it ' s very hard to deal with people that don ' t believe in the same things and don ' t live the same way that you do you know it ' s like as we think that
saddam hussein ruined the country and that
that iraq would be much better with a democracy so that the people could decide what they want
yeah
but then again you got you have all the palestinians that think that this saddam hussein is a you know is a god is someone that ' s going to relieve them of all their troubles and how can you get across to people that
think that you know their savior you ' re telling them that their savior
is a person of empty promises you can ' t you know it ' s hard it ' s hard to do that so it ' s hard to change a country especially in the middle east which has different views on life
yeah
yeah i don ' t know if the yeah united states is interested as much as establishing a democracy
as opposed to just getting rid of saddam you know it just
getting him out yeah
but you know we ' ll see if anything if he
if he gets stability and he doesn ' t you know get knocked off you know by a coup or something down the line you know what happens you know down the road i just it ' ll be interesting
uh - huh
i think i think the united states should stick around and play a role but i don ' t think that united states should get directly involved from now on they should kind of stay on the outside of
of the events you know kind of
i don ' t know how to say how to say it exactly in words but you know just kind of stay with one eye looking in the situation make sure that
yeah
united states can go in when need be you know it ' s not like we ' ll be ready if they ever ask for help
um - hum
yeah well it ' s interesting
yeah interesting there ' s like a two square mile area that ' s occupied by some iraqi soldiers and kuwait ' s saying it ' s their land
uh - huh
and they have the their line of demarcation is that what they call it
uh - huh
and they ' ve already outlined that for the cease fire and apparently we don ' t want to deal with that but the kuwaitis want this want these this land back that they ' re saying it ' s theirs
so that was kind of interesting that we said that we said no we ' re not going to get involved you know we ' ve already established you know the line of cease fire do you know and the demarcation line so
so there ' s already some trouble brewing huh
yeah
they were definitely trying to avoid any hostilities i thought it was interesting though that we did shoot down some of their airplanes when they went up but i don ' t think they ' re doing that anymore
yeah
you mean after the cease fire
yeah well they warned them we told them we would this is after that the cease fire so
well i think
yeah the well i think they also shot down some gunships is that what you ' re talking about the helicopter gun ships that they shot down
i don ' t know maybe they were helicopters i thought they were i thought they were letting the helicopters fly around
because what i heard was that the that the military was shooting down civilians and anti hussein
troops with gun ships
yeah
anyway so it ' s
it ' s a mess it ' s hard it ' s hard for two different societies to get together and try to help each other mutually when they don ' t agree on so many things
yep
and then you know and then and especially with the middle east the way it is they the too - sane you know these the arabs are fighting amongst themselves and then one arab decides to ask
a non arab for help and that just kind of turns everybody else against them like you know that ' s why the palestinians were rooting for or were pulling for hussein because they ' re all arabs
yeah
and they really didn ' t like the idea of the united states coming in and helping out kuwait who was so rich
well they hate i mean they hate us over there most those people
yeah
but obviously i think it was
you know the heads of state obviously you know
yeah
you know the ones that let us in but
it ' s that ' s anyway i would think
oh well
yeah i think it was good that
yeah i think we did the right thing
that we got that you know that
you know we drew the line somewhere
right
and whether that
you know what effect it has in the long run you know to be all right
well i think it deterred i think it deterred hussein from doing anything else because if for example we let hussein go in there and take kuwait then
it could have been just like you know world war two it may you know because hitler got little bit of what he wanted here he ' d try it again and got some more he ' d try again and got some more
um - hum and i and i think
yeah i the think you know it ' ll deter the next person from
right
you know thinking the same types of things but i think the problem is that we ' ll never get away from
the expansion idea i mean you know we ' re territory in general we ' re going to run into another you know
right
i don ' t want to go so far and say it ' s a hitler but crap saddam seems like he ' s as bad as hitler almost by the way you know they torture and kill people you know from what you read but
yeah
you know once the nuclear power you know nuclear
you know bombs get in the hands of some of these other countries for them to you know who knows
yeah because they don ' t have anything to lose so they ' ll go ahead and use them
who may try what down the road
yeah that ' s another thing is that they you know they just they don ' t understand implications i don ' t think or may or may not but
um - hum
but they have less to lose if they use them you know it ' s like they ' re third world countries they you know they they ' re like their people are in bad shape well we ' ll go ahead and use it and
put some other country in our shape see that ' s the way they think
yeah well we ' ll see and you know it has i may fairly young here i got to
so
yeah
it ' ll be interesting to see how it turns out now you know who does what if hussein actually stays in power or not
yeah
you know it ' s just a matter if he can survive you know without somebody else you know a coup attempt or something
yeah
we ' ll see all right well hey it was nice talking to you
okay so we are talking about recycling
recycling yeah
i just move down from up near boston
oh you did
yes and up there they ' re doing quite a bit
uh - huh
they one of the thing that they ' ve tried doing is they ' ve had it they got a deposit on all plastic containers you know bottles what not
you mean like bottles of what kind
i mean like coke bottles things like that and also cans so it ' s a five cent deposit on all of those which you know encourages somewhat for people to bring them back
oh coke bottle okay yeah
oh that ' s terrific
there also in areas up their that mandated separating your garbage
yeah so you have to separate the glass from the plastic from the
from the paper i believe even right
from the paper oh that ' s really
so i know that they ' re doing and up there and several community down here they ' re not doing a hole lot down here their actually are some community where they mandating that most i think it ' s aluminum from everything else
yeah
and also it ' s against the law anywhere in the county down here to deposit yard trash like you know clippings and stuff in the trash
yeah
so that ' s what they ' re doing here what are they doing there
well i i ' m very interested in this because i think it ' s extremely necessary and i i ' ve tried to you know from the very beginning i started you know trying to recycling even before they had any program
you know they just sort of had voluntary trash you know bins you could put your plastic in and now they it ' s they ' re trying to have
a city wide program where they ' re actually have special trucks to pick up your separated plastic and glass and newspapers
but it
but it still voluntary
but well they ' ve got trucks for part of the city and they haven ' t gotten enough trucks you know manufactured yet to take care of the whole city of plano
so some of the people in plano do have that recycling and it ' s pick up at their door and you know at their driveway and we don ' t
so we still have to take it voluntarily to the library where they have the you know the glass bin and the and the aluminum and but there they don ' t take plastic
what of the other things that there was been done up in massachusetts
that was very good were several of the grocery store chains were instituting a five cent credit if you brought back your bags and reuse them
oh that ' s great
see we ' re we don ' t have that yet either and i ' m trying you know i keep trying to remember to bring my little canvas bag into the store with me but i can ' t remember to do it
it ' s real hard to break that habit
sure
you know just going into the grocery for five or six thing and then you get in there you think why i don ' t have the bag with me you know
you haven ' t seen any i haven ' t seen any of that down here
but we have you know a lot now i saw one lady not to long ago with five or six of those canvas bags and she had them all with her and she took her grocery home in those which i thought was great
sure
you just never see anybody with them
right my parents live in little rock arkansas
so
oh they did yeah that ' s not to
yes well they do and they and i sent my mom a couple of those canvas bags just so she can do that because they you know they look at her like she was crazy there
oh they do okay
yeah well good for you
yeah they really we need to encourage i mean i know in new jersey where i ' m from
sure
but plano just needs to get more of these trucks
unfortunately i think that what we are seeing though is like areas like plano i where it ' s not as densely populating you know the whole area
yeah
oh yeah
see they have to do it yeah new jersey especially i mean that ' s a really highly populated state i guess massachusetts is to
right
is not is that where you ' re from originally is that where you were born
no actually not i was i was born in alabama and i lived in oklahoma where we didn ' t do any recycling i lived in arkansas massachusetts now florida
yeah
yeah so you ' ve been around
so massachusetts is probably like i said the best of what i seen there
well it ' s i just i just think the more you know you just each person have to consciously think about doing of something little or something big whatever you can do
sure
but
you know for the asphalt so they ' re gonna you know trash out
oh yes
oh that ' s a neat idea i never would have thought of that
so why don ' t oklahoma city thought of that
well that ' s the that ' s the thing that there are thing you can do that you can ' t you know nobody thinks about
sure
there are these things that people would get their minds working and just you know brainstorming that you just can it ' s a whole new way of thinking
sure
i believe in baltimore they ' re recycling glass and using it as part of the asphalt
are they really well that ' s neat
yes which they also think it is good because it makes the roads prettier
oh for heaven sakes that ' s right that ' s amazing because we use to live in baltimore
because they sparkle
we lived there for a while before we came down and we lived in pennsylvania and then we came here about fifteen years ago
my sister is born in baltimore
she was where she was at what hospital
okay bill right
yes
okay bill have you done much camping
yes i ' m a scoutmaster in boy scouts
ah ha
oh well that sounds good
i ' d say i camp quite a bit
yes you do now do you have a lot of mountain well you don ' t have mountains in texas do you where do you find places to camp
well we do a lot of canoeing when we go camping
oh
and we also carry all our equipment with us
uh - huh
and so we canoe down the river and then sleep on the river on one of the sand bars and then get up the next morning cook our breakfast and go down the river again
oh
oh my word well that sounds adventuresome
how about yourself
we have five children and so we have found that camping with the little ones isn ' t as enjoyable as just when we go ourselves so we ' ve tried to get out once a year and go
on a anniversary camp out and we have gone up into the mountains and not necessarily roughed it but we have just found it just real enjoyable to be alone up in the mountains
- ell that ' s good
and then the boys are our boys are old enough now they ' re twelve and eleven and so they ' re involved in the scouting and they do a lot of camping with the scouts
um - hum
and last year my one twelve year old went to the scout camp for a week and
so this year they ' ll both be going and so that ' s been real enjoyable for them
great
so
what kind of camping do they like best do they like it where they have tents and do they cook on stoves
yes they ' ve well
no actually they ' ve i remember they have taken the heavy cast iron dutch ovens and done their cooking there over the fire
um - hum
and i don ' t think they ' ve taken the stoves last year they camped in tents
and this year i believe it will be in tents also
uh - huh course i imagine it gets cold in parts of utah
uh - huh yeah
it doesn ' t get very cold in texas
so lots of times we don ' t even take tents
oh is that right
we just use trail tarps
oh and what does that consist of
it ' s just a piece of material that has that has a lot of
places where you can tie off to it and make it into a tent
oh
uh - huh
like a they ' re very light weight and we use them when we go backpacking
so we go backpacking fifteen or twenty miles then they ' re not very heavy see so you carry them with you and
uh - huh
oh
they ' ll keep you dry or whatever
um - hum
so have you had any adventures on your camping trips with encounters with wild animals or anything like that
yes in fact last month we went camping we saw a lot of deer
oh
in the morning and in the afternoon just deer everywhere
my word
jeez
uh - huh
but we got to see a lot of deer
oh
out and about and there ' s of course we see smaller animals all the time and one thing that is a big concern in the evening at night is make sure that all the food ' s put away and so forth
oh
because we have armadillos do you know what a armadillo is
oh they ' re covered with like a heavy armor
um - hum
type stuff uh - huh
and possums and raccoons
my word
and we have those creatures down here that they like to
they like to go hunting for a midnight snack
uh - huh
and so that can be a problem if you don ' t put all your equipment away
oh but they won ' t necessarily attack a human or bite you or anything
they will if you attack them
oh
but most time they run away from you
uh - huh
if they if they see you ' re up you know
uh - huh
oh my word
are you still there okay it worked that time okay
yes
okay
well we just ate out had a big lunch actually because we both have been working late and we had italian have you ever been to the olive garden
no i haven ' t is that good
it yeah well
do you really like italian food
it ' s not my favorite but i like it okay
then don ' t
then this ' ll probably be i mean this isn ' t really excellent italian food that sounds terrible to tell you go somewhere where it ' s not that great but it ' s
uh - huh
you ' re not going to believe this i have to tell you this if i don ' t because you ' re in plano that
that ' s okay
uh - huh
which i ' m not no it ' s all the garlic bread and all the salads you can eat with an entree
oh that sounds really good
so it wasn ' t too bad it really wasn ' t but i was more in the mood for french toast anyway so
yeah
but i really like italian food though but do you have any favorite
well are there just the two of you
yes uh - huh
okay well when my husband and i go out we have four children so that makes a difference for us when we go out with the kids obviously we want to go somewhere that we can the fast food ones are probably the ones they like the best
oh you ' re kidding
oh sure
but we don ' t like to go there because that ' s the most expensive so we like to go to a pizza place where you can buy a pizza for one price and feed the whole family like that
yeah and you can usually get a variety of what you ' re looking for like at gatti ' s or something like that
right
right but when my husband and i go out we like to go somewhere with a little atmosphere and we usually head on down oh what ' s the freeway down here
six thirty five uh - huh
yeah and there are all along that freeway there are restaurants but one of our favorites is pappasito ' s
oh yeah pappasito ' s we went there on my birthday in march it ' s great
no we love to go there yeah
you know it always kills me because i don ' t like the decorations so much it ' s too
too much like a bar naturally and mexico yeah i know i ' ve seen it
yeah but i love the food i love the food they just are great
the food is probably i ' m not a i ' m not a mexican food gourmet by any means but it ' s probably the best tasting i don ' t know if it would you classify that as tex - mex
yeah um - hum
the shredded beef the type of spices or sauces they use
yeah uh - huh i like to get a shrimp it ' s a shrimp dish and i don ' t remember the name of it but it ' s rolled up into something and oh it ' s really good that ' s good
every
really
uh - huh
i ' ve never had anything there that wasn ' t delicious
yeah they really good
even though you have to stand in line and all that that ' s the only thing i don ' t like about it too it ' s a little bit with the meat market atmosphere you know even though we don ' t have kids we ' ve been married long enough to be not to be around that
yeah
yeah
i ' m trying to think of what else we like to eat the one thing i notice it ' s just about dining out that you probably can relate to with four children and two of us getting ready to adopt i mean we find it prohibited just the cost anymore
um - hum
yeah
i mean lunch today was eighteen dollars
yeah it ' s very expensive
yeah and i don ' t know how you feel about that but i think some of it ' s over priced
yeah that ' s true
sometimes it ' s hard isn ' t it to keep a
yeah it is i don ' t know
no sometimes mark and i that ' s my husband mark go to the august moon which is down there it ' s a chinese restaurant with the lions in the front
um - hum uh - huh
oh yeah my husband likes that yeah off of arapaho down there yeah august moon uh - huh
yeah and it ' s pretty good as far as chinese food goes but chinese isn ' t my favorite so
i don ' t like it at all usually so
but he likes it kind of so he says that ' s a good place now me i ' m like i said seafood i ' m i like that
yeah i love seafood and i like a lot of different ethnic foods i like japanese food there ' s a place on greenville called sagar ' s
well we haven ' t been in years down near presby and i had a meeting down there today and i saw that and i said gee i remember that they offer you authentic japanese feeding or american or piano bar
ooh
uh - huh
uh - huh
is it oh how nice
yeah
which was really over priced
i don ' t know that ' s
was it
um - hum but great desert bar
yeah
yeah i like barbecue have you ever been to the i think it ' s called spring creek barbecue yeah they have pretty good food yeah
yeah now they ' re real good yeah they ' re good
oh
is to die for i bet ooh
yes i would be in hog heaven and how are your kids at an age where they can contribute to what they want or do you still order for them or
well my two littlest i just had a baby and she ' s six months and then my four year old he still but my other older two they can so they ' re
oh congratulations
uh - huh
oh i ' m telling you
it ' s really sad isn ' t it because it ' s hard to get them away from junk then
well it ' s kind of funny is sometimes we ' re like we all want different things and so there ' s a fifteenth avenue down here
um - hum
um - hum i know where that yeah
and along that street are all these fast food restaurants so we all get to go to our own little thing and drive through and get our own thing and then we go to a park over there so we can all have our own that ' s on the nights we can ' t decide
right that ' s all
um - hum
well that ' s all right as long as i was going to say because with six people how do you with two we have a problem
i mean i can ' t even imagine you know trying to you sound like you ' re doing pretty well there with four children
well i love them they ' re good kids
that ' s the way to yeah well we ' re getting ready to i shouldn ' t say this on this conversation but it ' s just on my mind we ' re getting ready to go overseas to adopt
so
oh how nice
yeah we ' re excited
it ' ll be neat
i ' m thirty something and i and i said is that what makes them drool anyway you know i guess are you is it a little bit constricted because a lot of restaurants don ' t take in terms of talking about restaurants i mean are a lot of restaurants
yeah
yeah
how are they when you have children let alone three or four children
you have to be careful if you go to a restaurant that really is more adult you know with the atmosphere and everything they if you ' re like we could probably take our oldest son and our oldest daughter
uh - huh
sure
um - hum
um - hum
and they know how to act i don ' t i don ' t think i ' d chance it with my younger ones because they ' re just too much of a distraction and some restaurants are really trying to go for that atmosphere kind of thing and
yeah
the yuppie kind of crowd yeah i just i just i ' ve been in some places where they say they take children and then i ' ve just seen where the wait attendance the wait staff is rude you know and that always just bothered me
yeah
so
yeah
yeah
it was absolutely putrid for italian food i can ' t remember the name of it it ' s on
oh
is it tia ' s not tia ' s
i can ' t yeah no that ' s mexican it ' s right across from on the dillard ' s side there or folley ' s
yeah i know which one it is and i can ' t think of it
i can ' t it ' s in the strip yeah and it had white i think it was like paper where you could write on them or something with crayons and it was just terrible
yeah
oh dear
yeah where you felt like you were
right like you ' re in a bad part of italy or something
oh dear oh
boy but other than that i don ' t know we do our share of pizza eating too
oh
yeah
well i i ' ve about said what my favorites were and i can ' t really think of any other
me too
no except it just makes me fat no i ' m just kidding but you can
places
yeah you have to watch it if you go out to eat that ' s true
well good luck
yes
okay what do you consider as camping
well
we ' ve done a lot of tent camping that ' s probably the closest definition that i usually think of but there are a couple of places in the san francisco area that are considered environmental campsites that are
sort of like rustic cabins they have no electricity and no water
um - hum
but there ' s usually a pot belly stove or something like that and
um - hum
you can spread out sleeping bags on wooden surfaces so
hm
um - hum well the only camping the only camping i ' ve done really is living in a tent we used to go to lake shasta like fifteen years in a row
we really enjoy that
oh that ' s beautiful
and you know take everything up there park our car unload the car and then go by boat to the camp spot you know two or three trips back to the car to unload everything
uh - huh
and the
no it was just a little camp spot that we found our you know by ourselves and it was usually in a little place called calucci creek
uh - huh
oh
and you know we put up our eating tent our john tent and our sleeping tent
and slept in the tent you know on
i don ' t think i ' ve ever seen a john tent that ' s
well
that ' s more rustic camping perhaps than i ' ve done usually where someplace where we ' re sort of close to
you know what it is it ' s actually one of those little tents that you take to the beach and you set up to change your clothes in that ' s what we use to put around our john
uh - huh
it was like two weeks
oh wow
how do you like that i don ' t think i ' ve ever been camping quite that long that seems like
it was
without showers and all you how did you
well just it was it was nice for a while but after fifteen years i got tired of it
how did you enjoy that
right
sounds like fun thing about shasta too is there ' s so many other things that you can do
but
i ' ve never gone anyplace else really except lake shasta camping you know
uh - huh is patterson fairly close to shasta
no patterson ' s down by modesto
oh okay
it ' s like twenty minutes away i used to live in oakland
oh well
and
used to go camping all the time up there but i ' ve lived down here in patterson now since eighty eight
yeah
uh - huh
you know
there are a lot of camping grounds county and state facilities in the santa cruz mountains south of here so
um - hum
tends to be a good place for us to get away sometimes
um - hum do you have little kids that like to
oh uh - huh
um - hum
it ' s fun for kids though isn ' t it
yeah they really enjoy it i think that she ' s at an age now you ' re not as concerned about where she ' s going to run off to she can pretty much stay close and
you know
um - hum
i think her first camping trip she was eight months old so
um - hum
hopefully she ' ll learn to enjoy it as much as we do
um - hum well i ' m ready to go camping again i did go camping in a in a camper on a pickup deer hunting
uh - huh
over a weekend so know lived in a camper on that
um - hum that ' s kind of fun we did that once in yosemite too
right that was one good reason in yosemite the person in the camper next to us had gotten hit by the bears that night so we were glad we were a little more secure
um - hum
um - hum
um - hum but
yes in fact i ' ve never been camping at all in yosemite outside of the camper arrangement i know that they have tent cabins
um - hum
that sort of remind me of the environmental cabin situation but
yeah
it would be fun to go camping up there again i haven ' t been up to yosemite for god i don ' t know how many years i would love to go up there again
yeah it ' s a beautiful place i think i worry that it ' s changing so much so quickly the valley has become so popular
um - hum
yeah i know if they say the road up there is terrible now you know with all the traffic
do you remember it a long time ago i don ' t know if you ever went there like back in the fifties or
it was a long time ago that i went there but i ' ve only been there once
oh uh - huh
you know
my folks used to tell me about trips that we took when we were little and that at that time there really weren ' t designated campsites so
um - hum
people would basically come as soon as they could to stakeout their terrain and
yeah but it ' s beautiful though you look outside in the dark and you see all the all the stars up there and everything compared to you know living in the
do you exercise a lot
it ' s scaled back considerably right now my exercise is pretty much limited to softball league and occasional ride on the bike
but i
i was just recently well recently nine months ago got married and bought a house so my outside activities have been curtailed somewhat
oh my
i think that ' s considered exercise whether you want it or not
yeah that that ' s true that ' s true it ' s there ' s always something to do and
and it keeps me going
well you ' re you are so far ahead of me i used to
but
i used to walk two miles a day and i really enjoyed it
uh - huh
yeah
because the two miles went fairly quickly i could do it in twenty eight minutes
yeah
and that ' s not stopping and talking to everyone along the way but it ' s a lot you know it ' s not too strenuous
right
and i could sort all kinds of things out and make plans and everything but i don ' t know what i did to my knee i
was crawling under a desk hooking up a computer
uh - huh
and i mashed it wrong or i did something
oh gosh
and the doctor has had me on medication and she doesn ' t want me to walk she said that ' s you know while it ' s healing you ' re going to mess it up so i can ' t walk
wow
and she said you know the most conservative approach you do the medicine you do the medicine again and again
before you think of surgery and i don ' t want her to think of surgery on my knee i don ' t want anyone to think about that
uh - huh
no that that ' s yeah that ' s a that ' s a tough situation
ever
that ' s that microscopic stuff you know uh - huh not my kneecap
uh - huh
yeah
but i miss it i really do and i
oh that it ' s so aggravating to have an injury like that my wife
oh really
yeah and she started running down there and all the hills
uh - huh
and she lasted about two weeks and her ankles couldn ' t take it anymore
she was used to running you know flat tracks and whatnot and
ever since that it ' s just been real difficult it ' s real aggravating because she starts in and her ankles will start hurting again and stuff
even if she does get on flat ground so she ' s kind of in the same mode she was all ready to
get back into it and start running five k ' s and ten k ' s and stuff this spring and she just hasn ' t been able to stick with the training schedule long enough to really get back in shape
and when you want to do it it ' s really aggravating you know it it ' s one thing to get motivated to start doing the exercise and it ' s another thing to already
be past that and then not be able to because of your health
i can you understand that
yeah
i don ' t really want to i just know i need to
well it ' s
uh - huh
sure
it ' s not anything i would want to but i can really tell the difference since i have not been able to walk
i have got to be so much more careful with what i do
yeah uh - huh it is and you know you
it ' s depressing
it ' s really it ' s harder to get out of bed in the morning and all kinds of stuff it your body just gets used to it and yeah i don ' t particularly enjoy
well i used to lift weights an awful lot and stuff like that i do enjoy riding bike but as far as the working out and lifting and things like that
i can ' t say i really enjoyed it all that much but once i got used to it
it was habit forming it was i felt so bad if i didn ' t
physically i mean i just my body was tuned into that mode
right boy
yeah
hopefully my knee is a hundred percent better maybe i can get back into it
yeah that ' s for sure
i have ask you a question off the subject though you ' re in you ' re living in the castle park area
okay
that ' s right
i grew up in oak cliff
did you really
yes just
close to methodist hospital
okay yeah
on candy c a n d y
right
oh
in fact i lived there
oh until nineteen
late nineteen fifties
okay
and that area is it changing back again so many people are moving back into those old houses and are restoring them
yeah it is we ' re on we ' re on a little street called bison trail
it ' s only about a block and a half long but it ' s over on the other end it it ' s over by the far edge of stephen ' s park golf course
oh i know exactly where that is
yeah it ' s you know where the little bridge is on north oak cliff boulevard yeah we are just south of that little bridge back up on the hill in the trees there
yeah sure
four houses sold last summer and three sold the summer before and everybody in their
late twenties to mid thirties are buying and starting to rebuild and fix things up again and everybody is real excited
oh that ' s
that ' s wonderful that is a gorgeous place
yeah and then
oh it ' s a lot of fun the people are great there too our
we ' ve got a real active neighborhood association and we have well we ' ve got four regular parties every year and we do a neighborhood recycling program and
you know all that kind of stuff so it ' s a lot of fun and it is it ' s a really beautiful area
and some of the people
some of the higher dollars lawyers and stuff downtown too are picking up some of those great big houses and they ' re getting they ' re getting them at a real bargain
well sure they are
you know they ' re getting four thousand square feet for a hundred fifty a hundred and seventy five thousand dollars
good great
and they ' re just going to town with them they ' re people are putting in pools and
and completely redoing the outside restoring to the original you know nineteen thirty nineteen forties look
oh wow
and it it ' s really coming around i guess
i need to go over there and just drive around and look it ' s
it ' s worth the trip
oh i ' m sure it must be
i ' m just we had a lovely little house over there it was like a two story
uh - huh
well story and a half really because we had a basement
okay
and the guy that built it was weird
yeah
okay
oh wow
and i just loved the neighborhood and i mean everyone had houses like that they were all completely different
yeah
uh - huh that ' s right
and so neat
yeah ours is kind of a little ranch style with a great big oh i guess it ' s twenty eight by fifteen front porch and next door we ' ve got an austin stone
across the street the guy just it was burnt out about two years ago and the guy moved in and completely redid it and it ' s got oh it ' s got a rounded
front on it it ' s all brick and he ' s landscaped his yard and he ' s about ready to put in a pool and things like that so
yeah there there ' s a variety you just don ' t see it anywhere else as far as the different styles in the houses and whatnot
now why couldn ' t your wife run around the golf course is that not good
oh she could a little bit we i tell you what we got into the fitness center at methodist
oh was he
and they have a quarter mile track there
so she has started doing that rather than rather than take off
oh
you know you don ' t want to she doesn ' t want to be out by herself anywhere in dallas regardless whether it ' s north dallas or whatnot and
when she goes over to this fitness center it ' s fenced in and there ' s somebody in the building watching her and all that so it ' s there ' s a lot of consideration
yes i really hear that you know i think you know you ' re in oak cliff
uh - huh
but i ' m in plano in west plano
yeah
and we live on one of those blocks that it ' s a neighborhood watch block we all know each other and the street doesn ' t go anywhere
uh - huh
right
if you are on the street you better belong there
that ' s right
because it ' s not a through street
that ' s right
uh - huh
had a lot of heartburn with that
yeah
i mean
it looked darker to him because he was in the house with the lights on
right
when i was out walking it was more of a pre dawn type pretty
but huh - uh he didn ' t think it looked pre dawn to him it looked dark and even he was real concerned about that so
yeah
yeah
it ' s not just because you are in oak cliff it ' s just because you ' re smart that you don ' t do things like that
that ' s right that ' s right it only takes one time that is it ' s a hard lesson to learn so
that ' s right
there ' s only one crazy out there you know to make any difference
uh - huh
where do you get most of your current events
uh - huh
i haven ' t been doing it so much now that it ' s calmed down
yeah i was i was we don ' t have cable so we were watching c n a lot and then trying to switch thank goodness for remote control
uh - huh
yeah
we were switching from one station to another and in between keeping the radio on
yeah c n coverage was really good
it was extraordinary yeah we and then you know couldn ' t wait for the newspaper reminded me of when i was younger the time of watergate and just couldn ' t get enough of it
yeah
yeah
but
it kind of get wrapped up in it
yeah
kind of like watching the olympics
huh
kind of like watching the olympics
yeah you just couldn ' t you couldn ' t put it you couldn ' t put it down
yeah
and but occasionally you know you ' d stay in tune just long enough to get the latest different tidbit or a different angle and you really became addicted to it for a while
right
do you normally read the newspaper every day
the what the post
uh - huh
and at that point i at least try to get through most the front section and maybe you know one or two other sections
yeah
i don ' t i don ' t regularly watch
news or
newspaper i would say i get probably most of it from my friends you know they finally told me hey there ' s a war going on oh okay
uh - huh
just the raleigh local paper
how does it how does compare have you can you like how does it compare to the post
oh it ' s not even a comparison
yeah that ' s funny because every once in a while if my husband and i have traveled or something and we pick up a local paper we ' re really shocked even in a major city at how local it is it ' s really provincial
yeah
yeah the news is the same way the local news here is kind of lousy
is it really i mean
it ' s not much different than when i lived in roanoke virginia which is really small town
that ' s maybe because we get so you know we ' re so jaded with the post
yeah
which is really international and it keeps reminding me you know that this we ' re really in an in an different situation here and i keep saying no wonder the rest of the people in the world vote for in the country vote the way they do i mean
yeah
that explains it
but i probably do watch more t v because i get home and in between say cooking dinner or something if i can catch a five or six o ' clock news
right
right
i watch that usually before we settle down depending what time we get to bed we ' ll usually watch the ten or the eleven o ' clock news we have a ten o ' clock news here at night and that ' s ideal
uh - huh
yeah
because by ten thirty i start to fade
so
i ' m in graduate school so i have a really weird schedule and i don ' t and i don ' t really don ' t have time for t v and newspaper just i wouldn ' t i wouldn ' t have time to read it so i ' m
what are you studying
like yeah i remember when i was in school
yeah
finding the latest thing out from my friends is usually the most time effective
yeah no i can remember way back in those days when i was in school the i think the only time we only really watched the news and this tells you how old i was during the cuban missile crisis
yeah
i we could just we were all centered around that television yep
what ' s neat is seeing history happen you know
that ' s exactly right and i ' d
i guess that ' s it
yeah although i do worry that how easy this one was might be a bad lesson
to the to the younger people you know than there is the other generation
yeah
oh that ' s true yeah
yeah
saw it first hand
that was probably the best part of the news was the some of the person human interest stories
uh - huh
yeah
little too much maybe
does it does it bother you that at this point in your life that you ' re not getting more direct news or
no not really
what are you studying
i ' m in computer science
okay yeah i guess
yeah how old are you
i ' m twenty five
okay then i ' m see i ' m about twenty years older
yeah
and i really do i do rely i do miss it i do rely on the news and i guess i regret i don ' t get enough really local we get some local papers but i guess i ' m more interested in the national or international
uh - huh
it ' s almost getting to the point where there is there ' s too much that
news overload
yeah you shouldn ' t even worry about most of the stuff i mean i don ' t know it ' s a little near sighted but
yeah
but
well it ' s i ' ll tell you though it is hard when you go to vote i mean there are so many issues and there ' re so many people running that you know unless you have some way of evaluating it
yeah
yeah
and i guess the news does help well it was really nice talking to you okay
okay did it work out your first time all right
i hope so
where you on the phone a long time
yeah i ' ve been sitting here alternately reading and watching television
yeah
you were he was waiting for what again
to he called in to get somebody on the line it took him about half an hour to find somebody
that ' s what this was yeah well let me go a head and push one okay
okay
uh - huh
murphy brown designing women that ilk
yeah
yeah what do you like
oh okay
so for the last year i mean we just got married and we decided well for the first year we won ' t get a tv so i mean i ' m totally out of it as far as tv goes
that ' s okay we ' ve been married eleven years and we went through that after about five years of marriage my old tv that i had from college when we got married finally went out and we went we made it for about almost eighteen months without a television
really
yeah but then all of a sudden when you get one you realize
yeah
vcr everything else
yeah now oh yeah and then you never use the vcr and now we have two of them and now it ' s like we ' re just glad we never went out and bought a compact disk player cause we wouldn ' t use it
really
yeah
well i don ' t know tv shows what can i tell you basically junk that ' s on television
yeah
that ' s my opinion yeah
i like things like i just mentioned have you ever seen murphy brown or anything like that
i don ' t think so
you don ' t think so that ' s the one with candice bergen in it
well see another thing was i worked on second shift for like a year and a half so
yeah that would do it
i would never see any shows anyway and then before that i was in college for four years and i never watched tv then because i didn ' t have time so
right nobody does yeah then uh - huh i know
i mean when i did watch tv it was soaps and mtv because the girls i lived with never changed the channel i mean it was like
yeah
me too when
and to this day twenty years later i ' m like i ' m in my thirties i ' m not that old but i ' m going jeez i can ' t believe that thing ' s still on television
i know i mean i ' m i almost got hooked on it cause everybody would took about it at dinner and everything else it you know it ' s like
yeah they you know about the only other kinds of things i like i like to watch a lot of news don ' t you miss that with not having a television so far
how long has it been since you ' ve had one
well about almost a year yeah
oh my god yeah you ' ve got about another six months and then you ' ll get one
well i mean i never really watched it much growing up but i thought you know my husband would really like miss it because he was an only child and he he ' s seen a lot of tv and i figured oh no it will never last but
uh - huh
i mean i don ' t miss it that much
yeah
that ' s funny
i ' ve seen cheers probably five times and i ' ve seen cros cosby show probably ten times
yeah i like the cosby la law is probably i ' ve seen cheers more then that i hate to admit but
cheers yeah i thought it was good i ' ve actually been to that bar in boston it ' s a you know it ' s a pretty funny show yeah it ' s kind of a
oh you have yeah i ' ve heard it ' s pretty cool
it ' s just a you know over priced
yeah
downtown boston yuppie you know tourist attraction
yeah
i ' m trying to think what else is on i know it ' s like
i watched a lot of tv when the war was on
yeah who didn ' t isn ' t that sad
and then i like watching a lot of like college basketball and pro football i mean that sounds kind of stupid but i do like
um - hum
no i like the pro i like actually i like pro basketball as opposed to i ' ll watch pro football but i like the nba play - offs
yeah
back when like the pistons were in them and now and where are you calling from or where
sherman texas where you from
sherman oh i ' m in dallas i was just saying where am i calling you from yeah well then i don ' t know if you like the mavericks or not or
so are you really from texas though you
yeah i ' m talking to you from dallas uh - huh
well sounds like you ' re from up north yeah
my voice you mean oh no that ' s just because i ' ve moved around and
oh i was gonna say cause i wondered if you really you know if you had any teams you like watching from up north or something
i ' m originally from pennsylvania so
actually i ' m a big chicago bears fan real big and i always watch them so what no matter who ' s on of course you like them too right do you
yeah
yeah
well i ' m from indiana
oh okay
yeah so i like the bears
and i ' m trying to think what else i watch on television sportswise i like i like tennis so i mean i ' m not i haven ' t played in years but i just like to watch you know two players really get go at it on television
i watch huh
yeah
yeah
gets boring after a while but i don ' t go ahead
i used to watch oprah a lot in the afternoon before i ' d go to work and stuff and now i see her every once in awhile like if i go workout at ti you know they have those t tv ' s right in front of the treadmills
oprah
uh - huh
yeah on the tracks yeah
i don ' t know she ' s not as good as she use to be but
maybe because she got chubby again or something
sure disposition ' s gone downhill
was she was her show big when you were in school since you haven ' t been out that long
was what
was her show big when you were in college since you haven ' t been out that long was it
oh yeah it was pretty cool i mean back then and then the show did you see the show where she lost all that fat and she wheeled it out in the cart
that was so cool and then man she ' s really porked out again i guess but yeah
see i know isn ' t that terrible i know i guess with that money who cares
i ' d eat too
yeah let ' s see what all ' s on television oh if you don ' t have a vcr we just got one after nine years don ' t even spend your money on it yeah cause you know if you like movies like we do
really
you do it once in awhile and then you know you see it when it first comes out if you really want to see it and then it usually comes on television within two years you know
yeah we got we got the dollar cinema in sherman so we usually see like first rate movies right away
yeah i ' m sorry
well it ' s hard to talk about something it ' s like me talking about taxes or something i feel bad cause i mean i should know something about tv shows but
yeah oh that ' s okay
i had one lady one time they called in i just signed up my husband had been on this project and i she called in and it was all about we don ' t have children and it ' s all about sending your kids to college and why you would advise them
so i know i mean it ' s like don ' t worry about it television at least you know everybody ' s at least seen during the war did you laugh when they had that man on what was his name wolf blitzer
what was that
that guy that was a reporter for cnn
uh - huh
his name is wolf blitzer did you see it him when he was doing the coverage of the gulf
i might of i forget was he the guy that got captured
no that was the other guy from cbs oh what was his name
oh
i can ' t remember his name
yeah but what about this wolf guy
they have but just of they made jokes about him like on the carson show and all that jay leno
oh you know what my absolute favorite show is david letterman i love that guy
huh
yeah he ' s funny
and saturday night live i used to watch that like i ' d come home from second shift and watch him like for an hour and a half he ' s great
yeah saturday night live has changed a lot if you haven ' t seen it in about a year
huh - uh
i mean i haven ' t seen it in a couple months but used to
has it gotten better
yeah actually i think it has i mean they finally like dana carvey and some of those people they really have some funny characters on there
really
yeah they have one character on there they just call it pat and they you don ' t know if it ' s a man or a woman
and they say well they ' re trying to deduce what he what he or she is so to see if it ' s a female they say well do you carry a purse and pat says no i carry a fanny pack
uh - huh
so you still don ' t know because a fanny pack is man or nowadays you know
yeah
that ' s funny
yeah it ' s it is pretty funny i mean they do some crazy things
like wayne ' s world i love that
