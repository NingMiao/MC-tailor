alright what do you think
well i think air pollution is a pretty big problem right now and it ' s i mean i think it ' s a real bad problem i don ' t think that a lot is really being done about it at this point
and there ' s just things like for a i think that cars especially here in the united states are just a major source of the pollution when you consider that most people have at least one automobile and people drive around all the time
and i think you know if you just totaled up i don ' t know any of the exact figures but all the millions of cars that are driving around spewing out carbon monoxide all the time i think you ' re going to end up with a pretty big number
right
and if you look at other countries like in the third world and stuff where people ride bikes and all that i ' m sure that their
air quality is much better than ours just as a result of their lack of having cars like if you look at los angeles i mean they ' ve they said that the major reason that it ' s so smoggy there is because they all sit and drive down the freeway everyday
hum okay well i mean also along the same lines i know that there ' s somebody i read one time about somebody ' s developed a test to look at the emissions from your car
uh - huh
right
you know you know i just don ' t i mean everybody ' s so concerned right now about recycling and everything i think that ' s pulled away from the focus of air pollution
uh - huh
uh - huh
right and there was i just saw today that
president bush they were had new a new regulation out that was going to put a canister to collect some of the exhaust fumes on most new cars and he
is not going to let that regulation pass through because he says that well it ' s going to cost too much money and take too many jobs away from the people up in michigan
and i just think that ' s ridiculous that i mean if they ' ve developed the technology to remove some of the harmful pollutants that come out of people ' s exhaust pipe and not implementing it is just seems kind of ludicrous to me
yeah i hadn ' t heard anything about that
uh - huh
right
uh - huh
right
you know and you can i mean i ' d go behind somebody the other day and you mean you saw this huge amount of smoke pouring out the back of their car and you had to change lanes to get away from them
uh - huh
you know and i mean if you can see it and smell it that badly on that vehicle think about how many others are pouring out that you can ' t see and smell
right exactly the another thing i don ' t know here in the midwest in indiana at least we produce most of our energy burning coal
and if you just look at some of these there ' s a coal burning electricity plant here in town and you can just sit there and watch the smoke stacks and the amount of pollution that just pours out of there
that ' s right
i use to live right next to this plant and every single day you would go out and your car would just have you know it ' s not like three inches of dust or anything but you can see the dust that had come out of this smoke stack and just fallen right down on your car
and you know they say that the coal we burn here in indiana is responsible for a large part of the acid rain that they have up in new york state and in canada and all that
and it ' s just you know it ' s ridiculous when we could be spending the money to develop the technology to you know clean up some of these
sources of pollution like the smoke stacks but then the big businesses say well we can ' t do it because it ' s going to cost us too much money and it ' s like well we kind of got to think a little bit more forward instead of
you know we ' re not going to make as much money this year because we ' re trying to clean things up i just it kind of
that ' s right
that ' s
well i know in dallas i ' m i live pretty close to downtown to dallas and you know and there are days you just you open the door and just go huh i ' m not leaving here today you know
uh - huh
yeah
and i mean there ' s a place that used to be called concrete city and they have all these things where they used to burn and what they would burn off would be lead
uh - huh
uh - huh
and now you know i mean here they ' ve been spewing this stuff out for forty years or more and they ' re just now beginning to figure out that you know that what they ' ve done is wrong
right
you know and now we ' re trying to clean that up but you know we ' ve seen the visible effects in the soil but it makes me wonder what kind of effects that it ' s had on the atmosphere that we don ' t know yet
um - hum
right
you know and so many of these things takes so many years to develop that we ' ve never you know it ' ll be past my life time before i see the effects of some of the things that we ' re doing now
right
so
yeah all and all i think that we really i mean if you look at almost any industry it ' s producing so much pollution i mean they ' re spewing out just tons of this atmospheric garbage every single year
um - hum
yeah i pushed in
okay
so how do you use your credit cards
oh we use them
for paying our gas
for paying
um - hum
but we pay off every month though so we never have to pay interest and we always we never get the credit cards
if there ' s a monthly or a yearly charge we always get it through our bank or somewhere where it ' s free so we never have to pay anything extra
yeah that ' s me i won ' t use one that i have to pay an annual fee
yeah we just don ' t think it ' s worth it
you know and i ' m like you i use it
so
well to buy my gas with my shell credit card i use that
and then like my emporium card and
uh - huh
weinstocks card i use that but i ' m like you i usually pay it off as soon as i get my bill why i don ' t just write a check i don ' t know
you know it ' s just really weird but i don ' t carry a lot of cash with me because i ' m always afraid that someone ' s going to steal my purse
yeah
yes exactly that ' s how i mean it ' s a rare day when i even have seventy five cents in my purse
yeah you know enough for a phone call and that ' s about all
yeah
but
other than that that ' s the that ' s the way i use them i know some people that uses them so bad that every one of them that they ' ve got they can ' t charge any more
you know and i think that ' s terrible
yeah because it ' s really it helps your if you have good credit you know it helps you in the long run when you want to go make a bigger purchase or something
oh yeah
yeah because if anything ever happens that you do need to you know you have excellent credit why
it really does help
yeah and i think it ' s more convenient too in a lot of cases like whenever we go on trips we always you know use our visa or our mastercard or whatever
and then you know we really don ' t have to pay for it out of our own pockets until about a month later
yeah
uh - huh
and so it helps us gain interest in the bank that when we do it we come out a even a little bit ahead because we ' ve been able to use whatever first off and then pay for it later
uh - huh
uh - huh
yeah well i think it ' s better to use credit cards too like i say because there ' s so many people around any more that ' s watching what you ' re doing and if you pull a wad of money out of your pocket
oh yeah
they ' re going to hit you over the head
yeah even if it ' s five bucks even
so i just don ' t i don ' t carry money i ' d just soon use my credit cards and just pay them off you know
yeah
and also if you if someone did happen to steal your credit card my husband was saying that if you know you notice it within i think it ' s twenty four hours you can report it in
and i he said the most you ' d ever have to pay is fifty dollars for them to cancel you know whatever payments you had and if whoever tried to you know credit it to the hilt
right
you ' d only have to pay fifty dollars of it and then
yeah
you know you can have your card back with
yeah right
pretty good rating you know because you can pay fifty dollars but not you know maybe five thousand or whatever
yeah right
and you know some of those stores don ' t even seem to check your signature or anything
i know
you know i don ' t know why they don ' t unless you have to spend a certain i don ' t know but i notice that some of them don ' t even look you know they just slide it in there and pass it back to you
yeah exactly
you know so i don ' t think that ' s right i think they should check it to make sure that the signature at least matches you know
yeah sure i mean it ' s just a precaution for everybody
uh - huh
yeah so
well let ' s see what else can i say about credit cards
oh i also use like to use discover when i can because you know they give you some money back every year
yeah i don ' t i don ' t that that ' s that sears discovery card is that what that
yeah
yeah now i don ' t have that one you know
well we just started doing that and
uh - huh
you know what it comes in handy is for when you ' re buying things like tickets for the train or airplanes
uh - huh
because they ' ll give you some money back you know and it ' s only a little bit but i mean it ' s still something we got two fifty last year
uh - huh
and so it ' s you know it helps out here and there
so
yeah they give you i think they start giving you like a half a percent back which doesn ' t sound like a thing but when you know when you add up everything you ' ve charged up on the discover card for a year
uh - huh
and they give you a half percent of that and that adds up to you know two fifty or something
oh i see
and so that ' s what
and i know we ' re going to get back more this year because they
you know we spent a little bit more
uh - huh
probably and they do it for how long you ' ve been a member i think too
i see
so do you keep a monthly budget or anything like that oh yeah
yeah
oh
so you keep record of all the checks you write and all the credit card
yeah
and all the a t m transactions and everything and i ' ve got a file for each of them and
uh - huh
how do you categorize these things that ' s what always sort of stumped me when i sat down to do it right huh
i have a file box and each file has a little piece of paper on it and each file there i have a file for each month of the year
okay
and then i also have files for like credit card receipts and when the bills come in for the credit cards they go in the month that they have to be paid for
okay so this insures that you know what your bills are and that they get paid
right
unless i get paid on time like for instance if a bill is due on march fourth i ' ll just i ' ll put it in the folder with march and that way when i get paid in march i know that whatever bill is in there have to be paid in that month
uh - huh
uh - huh
okay so that insures that the bills get paid before other things get paid for now do you uh - huh go ahead
right and that
and that way i keep a running list of what bills i do have and that way i know if i have any extra money or not
uh - huh
okay and what happens then when you don ' t
when i don ' t what
oh okay
oh uh - huh
so i ' m at home most of the time anyways but
like once in a while like when my taxes came back i had extra money so i paid a babysitter to watch my kids for the day and i went to i went to goofing off and you know just something little like that but it ' s something that you really got to keep an eye on when you have kids
uh - huh
uh - huh
because you ' re always got to have money when you have kids
oh yeah so do you do anything about you know saying hey i ' m willing to spend this much a month on food and this much a month on
well i have a i have a running budget for every month
clothing or
uh - huh
and on that budget i type up a budget for every month in the year and it has the bills that i know i have every month electric phone food the kid ' s pediatrician
uh - huh
uh - huh
uh - huh
uh - huh
my visa bill you know all the bills i know i have every month are on that budget
uh - huh
and so once all of those get paid i go through my file and see if there is anything else and if there ' s not then i know that the rest of the money is mine
so is food in that list also and so you have a certain amount you spend on
oh yes
groceries that you expect to spend for each month
right
right
okay and things like now some expenses come up you know twice a year or once a year like insurance
right or well that comes up every six months for me or like tags come up once a year and you ' ve got to figure that in too
uh - huh
uh - huh
so you have an entry for each month for those things
right whenever my tags come up there is an entry right there that says tags and then i just leave the space blank until i find out how much i owe for my tags and then i get them and that way i know i know that they have to be paid in that month so i ' m expecting it
uh - huh
uh - huh
and so you i mean each month before that do you put away you know one tenth one twelfth of it or
no usually i just pay it out of whatever paycheck is in that month because after i pay my regular bills i usually have approximately a hundred and fifty dollars and with that hundred and fifty dollars i pay things that come up like insurance
uh - huh
uh - huh
uh - huh
or tags or whatever happens to come up in that month
uh - huh
uh - huh so now what about the long term considerations like retirement and college and stuff
well i ' ve got an annuity fund set up because i don ' t know just the way i was raised i look toward the future
uh - huh
uh - huh
not only for my kids but for myself and i ' ve got an annuity for me and every two months i buy my boys each a savings bond
uh - huh
every since they have been born i ' ve been doing that
that sounds great
so
so now what exactly in an annuity i ' ve always found those a little confusing
an annuity is an account it ' s like a it ' s a type of savings account okay but you don ' t touch it you just deposit money into it but you don ' t touch it other than that and it just sits there and gains interest until your retirement
okay
okay now do you pay taxes on the interest
not right now
okay only when you draw it out
if
right
okay
and like if elderly people they have a choice of having an ira account and they get special discounts on like the
uh - huh
what ' s the word i ' m trying to think of the interest charges and stuff if they have an ira they get special rates on it and stuff
right
right for the elderly people and stuff that have iras set up and they get special discounts on that but an annuity is
hi phil
how you doing
pretty good how many children did you say you had
i have three i didn ' t say i have three of them yeah two i have the girl is the oldest and then two boys
wow you have three children boys girls
yeah well you ' re doing a lot better than i can i can ' t rattle them off like that i know my youngest is eighteen he ' s as i said in a senior in high school but i have a
my oldest son he ' s out seeing the world right now he ' s in australia at the present time
wow
so you don ' t get a chance to spend much time with him then until when he comes home
where i had a lot of things that i thought that i needed to do that were more important than spending time with my children in fact when they were younger i was attending school
ouch
yeah
and then i found myself short of cash so i also went in for a part - time job so by the time that i got home after my second job
yeah
you know it took away a lot of time from them we did go out to you know to the places that you typically take children to and we had a lot of fun but it seems as though the time went by so fast that
right
that i didn ' t really enjoy it as much as i could have if i worked at it a little harder
i ' ll bet that story ' s all too common i
it ' s unbelievable how fast you know when you get to the point where even your kid ' s age they don ' t want to spend time with you anymore and you know i
yeah
i don ' t think i would have to say i probably didn ' t get to spend as much time as i would have liked to either however i did you know
early on i was in the retail business and i worked late hours so i saw less of them then but then when i changed over and got into electronics industry i
uh - huh
i did have more time and i tried to spend some more time with them
and you know we did things as a family we went camping quite a bit and we you know took trips went to see my folks in florida and
and some of those kind of things
well camping is one thing that i could never get used to i used to take the kids to go fishing and things like that but i never went never went camping
uh - huh
that may be the difference in our part of the country we live in it ' s a lot easier to get out outside all year round well pretty near all year round out here
yeah
yeah up in new england it ' s
you know three or four or five months tops after that you ' re in the house
yeah
i guess
i can think of a
things i would like to have done differently on the kids though
well i can think of some enjoyable things that i did with the kids like we used to go up to new hampshire quite a bit and go to the white mountains area and visit all the you know the nature trails and things like that
um - hum
uh - huh
oh yeah
petting zoos and things
um - hum
our kids played
ball it wasn ' t it was like you know little league and it was dads oaks dads club which was a like a little league
uh - huh
you attend a lot of their games
yeah we used to go to the games and we had
uh - huh
and pick them up and carry them there and that kind of thing
did you spend as much time with your daughter as you did with your sons
i personally don ' t believe i did no for one reason being like i mentioned i was in retail when she was younger
uh - huh
and then
you know she being a girl i guess she probably spent a lot of time with her mother more so than with me
yeah i felt that myself as i as i grew older my child grew older that i realized that i didn ' t spend half as much time with my daughter as i did my sons because i ' d want to do the things that i thought
that they would like to do and it would always be the things that i wanted to do without realizing it you know things like you know fishing and doing things outside and my daughter didn ' t like doing those things so she ended up spending more time with her mother than
um - hum
oh yeah
than with myself and i think she ' s closer to her mother today than she is to me because of that
yeah
that ' s probably the same
case in our family too
yeah it ' s unfortunate because yeah you know even though you think of them as a whole family when you do things sometimes you separate them without even realizing it
yeah a lot of cases daughters getting get real close to their dads too you know and
yeah
yeah
and she ' d always say well i want to go to my girlfriend ' s house or i want to stay home and do this or she had like little projects she was working on at home and things like that
so i kind of missed that i my daughter especially being with her
is your daughter the oldest
no she ' s the second oldest she ' s twenty three now
you have you ever heard much about that theory about the you know how their different their position in the family relates to their you know some of their
personality traits and things like that no i can ' t say that i have
mannerisms and personality yeah
yeah i believe it ' s true it ' s my experiences what i know about it and then observing it with my kids at least and then like some other people ' s children too it ' s
you know it ' s you know the older kid is more always more prone to be more like responsible and that kind of thing
uh - huh
yeah and
in our case he he ' s real sensitive and real thoughtful and
the youngest one is more sensitive that ' s same with my family and it ' s strange
yes
i don ' t know if
but if i say the wrong thing to my youngest son he will he won ' t cry anymore because he ' s too old but he gets hurt he bruises very easily and i can feel that
yeah right that ' s
that ' s matthew he ' s it ' s boy he was always he just
he ' d keep it to himself a lot of times but he ' d really kind of well up
yeah
i remember when i first took my kids out fishing and again i was with my two sons and not with my daughter but no i was with my oldest son my youngest son wasn ' t old enough or i didn ' t think he was old enough to take out and
we caught this fish it was it was a fairly large size fish and he was very proud it of he put it on the backseat on the floor and it was waggling around and we came home and he
huh
and
yeah
oh okay
you know and we need you know better health insurance and you know
okay
right
yep
okay
well right now i ' m just a student i only work part time but i i ' ve work in the job force before and
uh - huh
forty hours is just too long you just don ' t have any time to do anything it seems like
saturday you get off but sunday you ' re getting ready for monday
and if we could have us if we could have a thirty two hour work week well that ' d happen is that for every four people we ' d give another job
right
and then that way that everybody would have a three day holiday okay and that way that more that would make a bigger market we ' d have
more recreation people would have time to do it there ' d be less of a stress level we ' d have we ' d have less crime we ' d have to we ' d have to build less prisons we ' d you know less police force
yeah it all makes sense to me although there may be more crime i mean if people have more leisure time it ' s not clear in that
it that ' s a that ' s a possibility one of the problems they ' re facing now a lot of people now is that the health insurance
yeah
is that the small businesses can ' t offer us health insurance
uh - huh
and it it ' s too costly and then what is happening is that they ' re on
a policy where they have x amount of users in it okay and so they get a specific rate well what happens is that if people start becoming having chronic illness and
and things like that
what and they where they have to spend out a lot of money for one particular it ' s called a group well what ' ll what happens then is that
right
they cancel because they just can ' t cancel the indivigal
so that they have to cancel is just like life insurance they have to cancel everything
um - hum
so what they do is that they cancel the insurance and then all the people don ' t have any insurance coverage
right
so
but i ' m you know i ' m satisfied with my job i ' m an engineering student and i work for my instructor and i ' m
right
i ' m not a typical student i ' m older i ' m in my thirties okay and so i have a lot of job experience and
yeah
my instructor thrives on that because he can just tell me what he wants and he can give me access and tell me what to do and just turn me loose but in the in the same token
right
it ' s a really enjoyable for me because i don ' t have to have you know nobody breathing down my back and
one of the things that i really hate about jobs i don ' t i don ' t like bosses that you know wanna
yell at you and you know and are down your back and all this and that i just really can ' t deal with that so
yeah
what kind of what kind of jobs have you done
well i do research in computer science and i ' ve just been doing that for a few years now so
uh - huh
i my job has most of the benefits i want
what i really like is i like being like they send me to conferences for instance but probably not as much as i ' d like but
you know that ' s just nice being you know having a company being able to give you time to do that sort of thing and sort of
they also a really important thing to me is when they
they pay for continuing education like i get night courses that they ' re they ' ll cover right now and that ' s really good
yeah that ' s great you have what you might call knowledge power you know when you work at a company
yeah
right
whether you know it or not is that you ' re categorized some people can be let go and replaced like say a typist somebody who does data entry or answers the telephone a receptionist
but if you ' re a person that ' s doing computer type things and you have the you have the knowledge you know what the system you ' ve revised and revamped the system well then you ' re vital to the company and you get more of the benefits so
yeah
that ' s where i ' m i like i ' m into computers too and that ' s one of the things that i ' ve found in any one of these jobs and anything i ' ve done
is that to have knowledge when you have the knowledge you ' re not gonna you know be let go you know be one of the last ones to let go anyway
okay
i don ' t really i more
the people i wouldn ' t consider to be a threat at all
and i really don ' t feel much like the soviet union itself is a threat anymore i ' m worried about them they ' re in a very
tumultuous state right now with the kinds of adaptations that they ' re attempting to go through
so
i ' m concerned about them not as a military threat but as a burden
they ' re very large
and they could become very quickly a large financial burden as one more stepchild we have to carry around
yeah i think that ' s a real important aspect and that as the most the
let ' s see
the more that we that we do or that we can do to help them become self sufficient is going to eliminate more of the risk
this last winter was very hard on several areas in the in the ukraine particularly the coal mining regions
of siberia the people there have money that ' s not their problem but there ' s no food for them to buy and its you can ' t eat money
and they have a problem their whole attitude
i i ' m not sure which crop it was but they had a crop that rotted in the fields because they couldn ' t get anyone to harvest it
yeah
and the people in the city were saying well why should i go do that make the government do that that ' s not my job
right they ' ve got a lot of adjustments to make with coming out of what they ' ve been through
now and
they don ' t understand that to make that work they ' ve got to take some responsibility for themselves it ' s not just the government ' s responsibility anymore
you can ' t just blame it on the government when they give you the freedom to take care of yourself then that puts some responsibility on you as well
absolutely
and i think that they ' re having a hard time with the concept of you cannot go back people only go forward
as texas el paso they were undefeated until thursday night when they played the university of utah here in salt lake city and
oh really hum
they were beaten by a last minute three point shot
oh my gosh
and so it kind of opened things up a little bit they play brigham young university tonight
uh - huh
and i i ' m pretty sure they really got a good team this year and i
do they do they traditionally have a good team or is this sort of an unusually thing
yes they do they usually they ' re usually the one or two in the in the wac conference and they ' re the only team from texas
huh
huh
huh yeah see we ' re it ' s they ' re actually in the university of texas system and i don ' t i don ' t even know anything about them i ' m here in austin we have ut austin
uh - huh
the longhorns
uh - huh
and
yeah who ' s doing the who ' s leading the conference
actually i don ' t know right now longhorns aren ' t having quite the year that they had hoped they had a star forward that was disqualified because of
i see
oh
of something i guess as he was leaving his junior college they some supporter gave him a car or something and
that kind of fouled things up plus maybe
um - hum
right well last year the university of utah went and they had two of their stars
uh - huh
got hurt the beginning of the season this year and that ' s why texas el paso is in the university of utah went to the nc double a ' s last year and got into the final sixteen i guess but
um - hum
yeah
utep like i say is doing real well and it ' s too bad that they have something like that did they restrict the
the longhorns as far as being able to play in any of the
no it something had happened outside of that you know and it happened as part of his junior college career
junior college so it didn ' t affect their program other than loosing him yeah right that ' s too bad
and then actually ut on his behalf filed a an injunction in the court system to allow him to continue to play which worked for a few games and then they then they pulled him in so
yeah but
oh that ' s too bad
they ' ve been having i mean last year they had a real good team they had they had a new coach tom penders come in about i guess about three years ago
um - hum
and the program had been in a long a long decline you know for years they i guess back when abe lemons was here they built quite a quite a tradition
i see
um - hum
and then it kind of went downhill for about for a couple of coaches and penders has done a good job of getting it back on its feet and doing some you know playing some good basketball but
good i know i was in montana this last week and i saw the
huh the women ' s team from texas was playing penn state
yeah
uh - huh
and penn state was ranked number eight i believe in the women ' s basketball and i got to watch the half and then i had to leave on a flight back to utah and i texas was leading
um - hum
hum
i don ' t know how they came out i don ' t know if you heard or not but
i don ' t know yeah the women ' s program is quite interesting down here the women ' s program here in austin
actually for a while it was drawing bigger crowds than the men ' s program if you could imagine that they but they you know they just have traditionally been a dominant a dominant basketball team i mean they ' ve always been in the top
yeah
top eight in the country and actually had a couple of years that they haven ' t been quite as strong but
um - hum
the southwestern conference they ' ve been undefeated in the they were no they aren ' t now but they had been undefeated in the southwestern conference for something like a five year streak or something
i wish them well
and had won the conference title for ten years in a row or
that ' s great
and so - at is they ' ve that ' s quite a tradition here in texas but
i ' ll say
yeah that ' s
last year the university of utah that was the best season they ' d had and the well the coach had come in this rick majerus he ' d come in he ' d only been there a couple years and
um - hum
oh yeah
um - hum
really built the program and they were supposed to well they were rated up in the first top ten this year until they lost their two of their star players and through injuries
uh - huh
right
right now we i ' ve got a four year old subaru and a two year old honda
oh my goodness well we ' re sort of sort of a general motors family i guess that ' s the way we were raised
and we were overseas for ti for a number of years and when we came back we suddenly find out we ' ve got five licensed drivers in the family
oh goodness
really
for you know they each had twenty one thousand miles or something like that and turns out that ' s a pretty good place to buy cars because they maintain them and they can show you the records they ' ve gotten all their maintenance on schedule and everything like that
um - hum
then we ' ve got an eighty six chevy spectrum that we bought new my daughter was a freshman in college when we bought it for her
uh - huh
and we ' ve got a eighty four toyota that we bought used so we ' ve got four cars for our five licensed drivers it ' s like musical chairs
i bet i bet
and we got older and got away and then we thought well you know you still could buy general motors products and it was probably not that bad but we lived in malaysia for ti in nineteen eighty one two three and four
um - hum
no
um - hum
and we bought a we lived in the philippines for ti in eighty five eighty six and eighty seven and we bought a ford telstar which is somewhat similar to the taurus it ' s sold in the in the far eastern far east countries more
um - hum
um - hum
yeah
yeah
um - hum
oh yeah the big yeah
really rugged gm cars
um - hum
sure
yeah
um - hum
you know as far as durability so we kind of
right
um - hum
yeah
yeah it seems that something goes every month
yeah
and i ' m afraid we ' re gonna be in that in another year with all of ours you know we got three eighty sixes and an eighty four and we ' ll probably be there with all of them you know it ' s the same thing you know i don ' t know whether you classify the skylark and the calais as small i guess they ' re intermediates
um - hum
um - hum
but we went on a family trip to massachusetts and there were five of us and five of us never go anywhere together here
right
um - hum
it ' s like a yacht
it was just nice it floated
yeah what we sold our we traded in our le sabre for our subaru
oh yeah
yeah it was a great car it just we ran the wheels right off of it
yeah
yeah and
and you know i ' ve read i ' m in the quality business at ti i ' m a quality manager and we ' re we deal we sell i ' m in the semiconductor group and we sell to ford chrysler and gm delco
um - hum
um - hum
and i and you know we used to think ford products were tinny i mean i was growing up
i was taught that when i was growing up you know that real people bought general motors products and you know and peons bought ford products but just with the quality requirements
that ford is putting on us and the way they come into our plants and they ' re really
stressing this partnerships in quality and you know gm and chrysler are doing that but i really think ford ' s got a - ship position in this right now and i think it ' s showing up in their automobiles their automobiles are getting a very good quality reputation right now
um - hum
and we went to austin a while back to a basketball tournament and we were gonna be meeting some of my wife ' s relatives down there so we decided rather than drive one of our cars down we ' d rent
one and we went up to the local budget and we were gonna get a olds eighty eight or something he said i ' ll tell you what for a dollar a day more i ' ll give you a lincoln towncar
um - hum
hm
and we drove that down and i hated to turn that back in when we got back we had that for three days and i absolutely except i wouldn ' t wanna have to park it in tight places all the time
both coming and going so i knew what i actually got on the trip and it was about twenty four miles a gallon
um - hum
and you know we just got it out on the highway and put it in cruise control at about sixty and let it let it float
um - hum
and it was pretty nice are you are you planning on getting any additional or other cars
it ' s a nice car
um - hum
oh around sixty thousand miles on them we drive a lot
oh yeah you probably got another thirty or forty thousand if you maintain them
um - hum
we ' ve got probably we ' ll get something in the next couple years my son will graduate from high school this year and he ' s gonna go to richland college one year behind us
um - hum
a pickup
and i want a pickup i may get one and not let him have it but we have been looking at these red they they ' re very popular around here
um - hum
these red chevy pickups and we ' ll probably do something like that incidentally
and or send you to a guy with whom they ' ve already got a deal
um - hum
and my boss just bought a chevy pickup and he got three thousand dollars off the sticker price doing it this way
really
yeah and you know you figure out the options go around look at the dealers and get the best price you can and then go call this guy and tell him what you want and he ' ll put you in touch with a certain guy a certain person at that dealer ' s place
um - hum
so i ' m gonna try that the next time i buy one
i think that ' d be a good idea
yeah
we ' ve kind of been the types that will say this is what we intend to spend this is the car we want will you sell me this car for that price
yeah
and for that price
and we ' ve had we with our when we bought our subaru the guy was like you can ' t do this to me and we were just like okay fine we won ' t then you know and he ' s like no but
we ' ll go somewhere else yeah
yeah and i think that ' s probably the way you got to do it when i was young
i went in and bought a or made a deal on a sixty this is nineteen sixty i ' d first come to texas and made a deal on a sixty red impala convertible
um - hum
um - hum
i got back and a salesman that lived in the apartment i did asked me if he ' d heard i was gonna get a car and asked me what i paid for it he said well hey before you go buying anything he says call this friend of mine at will ' s point
um - hum
goodness
and he says oh somebody ' s taking he said what did you get a deal for bill and i told him he says somebody ' s taking you for a ride and i said no somebody took me for a ride
yeah i have the problem with the telemarketers over here we get we get all types we get the handicapped people calling up here
yeah
and if you don ' t want the light bulbs there ' s vitamins and if you don ' t want the vitamins there ' s the household cleaner
pens
boy they they ' re tugging on a few strings at once aren ' t they
yeah they were bugging me for a donation earlier and i you know i get these calls on one line just constantly every single organization
yeah
and you know you it ' s i ' ve learned to hang up on them but sometimes it ' s not so easy
yeah i got some call last night i ' m trying to remember oh this was like this is kind of an invasion of privacy where
i went to a wedding expo because i ' m getting married and there are like you know these places where they say you know sign up for a free whatever you know for a drawing
yeah
and you do it and you know all of a sudden this guy is calling you and saying hi we want to call you know talk about video taping your wedding when shall we set a time up and i couldn ' t get the guy to get off the phone
it ' s like how many at what part of no didn ' t you understand you know
the other thing that i think is amusing are with these long distance companies now we have mci here
yeah same here
and they have their friends and family program and i love it you can call up on one of the lines the
family right
well there ' s another one the account balance line all you got to know is the person ' s zip code
right
and you can find out how they ' re paying their m c i bills and on anyone you know all you got to do is cross reference a phone number with a zip code
which isn ' t too difficult and you can learn all sorts of things and sprint does the same thing
- eah
i think in general you know technology as nice as it is causing a lot it ' s just too easy now to it ' s like you know bay banks used to be you know you could do anything over the phone
yeah
you had to know your pin number but i could i could just say to it empty my whole account out if i wanted transfer things
and you know there there ' s a lot of risk involved there because you know it it ' s like you know the best example is probably credit reports now
huh
where you know god knows what goes on those things i mean thankfully now you can get your reports for free at least from trw
you know and then you find out you can go for a house or something all of a sudden you find out what all these people have been you know dumping information about you in there and i ' ve heard of cases where it was just done vindictively
yeah we had we got a report back in the mail as a matter of fact and found all sorts of problems with it mainly account numbers that have changed and they left both accounts showing as open
yeah
and some other one that claimed i didn ' t pay them and i did and then you have to try and get that company to take you off and they don ' t really want to bother and
yeah
yeah when i when i applied for my gold mastercard they said well you have to close this other mastercard out too and i said you mean the one i closed two years ago
and i had to get a letter from this other company saying that i had closed it
oh yeah it ' s a pain in the neck because they you know they ' ll believe these companies in a second over the individual
yeah
and getting proof for these people i mean it ' s not my job you ' re the one that screwed up and you know if you want to damage my credit rating that ' s fine but i will take whatever actions are appropriate to protect it
how you know you ' re permitting them to do credit checks of you and to make your information available to other people and by the time you get through reading it you ' ve basically permitted them to you know broadcast on the evening news your credit rating
right
well you know there ' s much more subtle kinds of invasions of like every time you call an eight hundred number you ' re giving them your phone number
oh yeah i know i ' ve been reading the comp dcom telecom all about it
yeah we ' re we both probably signed up for this in the same place
yeah i contribute every once in a while in there and yeah i see the messages about the a n i
a n i yeah but to some extent i ' m not as worried about that because yeah you ' re getting a value for that you ' re getting to call these people for free
yeah i you know the other boondoggle is this caller i d thing you know i don ' t mind caller i d one bit
um - hum
okay national service what do you think about it i ' m sorry i forgot your name already
lee
lee okay lee
oh well i think ideally people should want to do that automatically and that they should want to do what
you know meshes with how they feel and what they ' re good at and they shouldn ' t be funneled into a mandatory sort of a thing
um - hum
oh well in that case i think what this country needs is a good mandatory program to
you know get people just thinking hey this is normal it ' s normal to do good you know to be civic minded you know just so they won ' t you know everybody will just think
um - hum
hum
well think of how much we have to pay for it i i ' m you know i think if it ' s voluntary you get the people that want to be there
this is the way things are and it
they ' ll do well if it ' s mandatory you get everybody you get people that don ' t want to don ' t want to do work like that and they ' ll goof off or sell drugs to their coworkers or something like that
well i ' m not looking at the mandatory program as a cost effective way of getting this stuff done i ' m looking at it as a way to shape people ' s psyches into thinking that public service is a good thing
hum
of course the program would have to work or else they ' ll think yeah public service another boondoggle you know they ' ll be sitting there working on the job doing nothing
yeah i ' m
well think of it yeah i but i wonder about that the mere fact that it isn ' t cost effective do you think that if it ' s not cost effective do you think that people are going to be enthused about it
oh well certainly the people that do volunteer to do all sorts of things aren ' t thinking cost effective
well i think everything that people you know what do people do they polish their cars right why do they do it because
they think they ' re going to be saving lots of money on repainting and having the car last that much longer no because they want it to look really sharp
hum
not a cost effective thing you know they raise money to build a new church because they want to put eight zillion filigrees there because it ' s cost effective or because they need the space
kids turning eighteen every year i think it ' s about that might be a little bit lower now but
that ' s an awful lot to bring into a program you got to have eight million jobs available you ' ve got to have administrators for eight million jobs that would be tremendously expensive
not you know not to forget the cost of putting all of those kids in non market
enterprises for a couple of years that ' s going to delay their entry into the work force delay the time when they can begin paying taxes too so the impact is going to be double there i
just don ' t see
you have to define the purpose of the program you know is there excess labor and that ' s why you ' re doing this
no
i mean what there ' s sort of both excess bodies available to labor but then there ' s not enough skilled labor
i don ' t know i
so at the same time you have too many people who want to or too many people who could work and not enough people who can work
yeah i grant to that but if that ' s the case then it needn ' t then you don ' t have a you don ' t need a mandatory program to bring everybody into national service
you just need a program for the people that haven ' t gotten anything better to do and i think that might be a good idea although again then you get the kind of people who are likely to sell drugs to their coworkers et cetera
well they did this in the depression they invented what the ccc
right
and they had a whole bunch of people go out west and dig ditches and plant trees and
that ' s true but i think that was different in at least three respects first of all
it was not a mandatory program if you didn ' t have another job you could join it you were not required to but it was a way to get a paycheck so people did join it
yes
yes i am
i ' ve been trying to get people at five thirty and six thirty in the evening and i thought well i ' m not having any luck i ' ll try the middle of the afternoon
well i ' m happy we got through
i am too well do you have any opinion on the subject
well i ' m especially interested with what what ' s happening in the soviet union the move to
hm
is quite a remarkable
oh
accomplishment is that is that reported in the texas papers
or a population or anything i ' m really uninformed
um - hum
if i was looking at a us map i would say it was sort of reminds me of a
- ell it ' s not as big as california proportionately
um - hum
yeah
they ' re completely out now
right i thought they were
yeah the three the three baltic republics got out as quickly as they could
so they have a probably really fight to keep it in if they could
no they don ' t
yes
yes
foodwise or any wise sounds to me like they ' ll start rioting soon or not that would do any good but i guess people do that when they ' re desperate
that that ' s true
hasn ' t happened here for a while but it
well that ' s true since the depression i guess when the veterans went to washington
um - hum
and well you know with war riots of course
no i ' ve heard they ' re i hear you have some problems
well we do we have lots and lots of layoffs here lot of companies folding lot of layoffs and it ' s pretty scary
do you do you do you blame the government in washington for this
yes
and so i assume that has some effect
yeah
or a great effect and i do i mean they said during the reagan bush years the rich got richer the poor got poorer the statistics prove that
um - hum
um - hum
so i mean you think it ' s you think it ' s reagan and bush have done this or is it just coincidence it was during this period
um - hum
of course if somebody in china can make something for ten cents and we have to make it for ten dollars because we have unions well i don ' t know what ' s gonna happen then
oh the chinese use slave labor too that ' s one of the ways they get away with it
and child labor right well i don ' t know what do you think has caused our horrible situation
yeah
i don ' t think there ' s any one simple answer to the whole thing i mean it ' s that ' s very complicated
one thing
right well they say too that having a democratic congress
and republican president is not good the i mean i ' ve read that is a theory
so which one are we gonna throw out
uh - huh
texas used to be a democratic state didn ' t it
oh i know it used to right well you don ' t run too many democrats anymore for a while i kind of deserted the party but
now it ' s looking better to me
i like your governor
oh do you oh i ' m glad to hear that well i think so too i just admire her a lot
she ' s an impressive woman
yeah
and i really hope she does well but she ' s
well yeah anybody could beat claytie in
okay do you have you ever had to put your children in child care mary dell
oh yes i ' m an old experienced hand i started back when it wasn ' t stylish to do that at all my daughter that ' s seventeen now
uh - huh
i worked even when she was a baby
oh
and i had private care for both my daughters until they were two and then i was really lucky to have put them in a methodist day school at preston hollow methodist
uh - huh
right off of walnut hill and preston and it was a wonderful environment i just wish all kids if they have to be put in day school could have that kind of place
uh - huh
uh - huh i see
so it worked well how about you
oh well i have a nine year old and a six year old and neither one of them has ever been in day care for the reason of me working but they both went through preschool
uh - huh
uh - huh
yeah
uh - huh
it ' s not hard to find anything that ' s part - time so many of the churches have really strong
right like half day programs uh - huh
preschool and children ' s day out but it was a nightmare back when cheryl was little and this is one of the few churches that did it there were a couple downtown dallas
uh - huh
uh - huh
and what i liked about preston hollow is that
the people that were there when cheryl was two which was fifteen years ago many of them are still there today so there was real continuity she went back as a teenager and these people that had changed her diapers when she was three were still there
oh
oh my gosh
so it was really neat but it was because they had a director that had always done it as a labor of love and she just kept good people and
uh - huh
oh my goodness
real cheerful place lots of arts and crafts and i ' m really glad my kids had it because plano schools do so little of that
right yeah
that if they hadn ' t had it before they hit first grade they were never going to have any art or music or any of the interpretive stuff
uh - huh yeah that is a big drawback i think in that in the public schools out here
uh - huh
or pay for it after school our emily ' s in the third grade over at huffman and they started a pilot program where we can pay private tuition so that they can take french and music and art and
oh is that right i had no idea
you know i willingly did it but i thought this makes me angry this is something that ought to be in the schools
oh my goodness
rather than some of the other stuff they do yeah
and with our budget cuts i ' m sure that ' s not going to
well that ' s the only way they ' re yeah that ' s the only way they ' re going to be able to do it and parents who really want their kids to have any humanities are going to have to do that so in some ways i think the day schools do serve those purposes
not going to change anytime soon
oh my goodness
yeah that ' s true well even the preschools you know they get so much of that in preschool and then when they hit kindergarten
yeah get the computers out and you know well that ' s hard it ' s so difficult for them
uh - huh
uh - huh
did you have your children did you say in home in private care was that in your home or in someone else ' s home
until they were two yeah both times they were at our house
uh - huh so you were able to have somebody come there
yeah did you have a nanny or did you have someone that lived in with you
yeah
well no she didn ' t live with us the first one was an elderly lady who was putting a daughter through nursing school just purely on babysitting money
oh
oh my goodness
uh - huh
yeah
oh
so that was a plus from that respect as well and then with emily it was a neighborhood friend that kept her so
oh gosh
uh - huh i have a
i just cannot fathom putting a little bitty baby in a commercial care center
uh - huh i was just listening to a program this morning oh well i guess it was on the home show but they were talking about
um - hum
um - hum
and they ' ve now moved it to washington dc and the doctor that was on there the pediatrician said you know i can ' t imagine leaving a three week old and taking them to a nursery day care and leaving them there
yeah oh that would be hard
you know so
well they give a lot more leave i work at ncnb now and our benefits for maternal and parental care and even for elderly people or
uh - huh
are really expanding we have more options now then we did when i my kids were born with being able to take off full - time longer of you can phase your schedule in so that it ' s not full - time
uh - huh
oh boy that ' s great
for up to six months it ' s really neat i ' ve had a couple of assistants that came back just three days a week or they ' ve you know whatever schedule they want from a pay standpoint
uh - huh
we try to work it with their hours and that helps because you don ' t have to just wean yourself cold turkey and say okay i never get to see my baby for eight hours a day again
yeah
right
and the bank has a lot of programs now for child care referrals i ' ve of course it ' s too late for me so i ' ve not tried them to see how effective they are but
yeah
uh - huh
i think we ' re finally beginning to make progress but just not very fast
gosh it ' s amazing
and for our age group it ' s too late too little too late
right
uh - huh
well and i would think you know since big business is supposedly
uh - huh
you know the people that work in big business have families they have children so it ' s only to their advantage that they get these programs going and working and
right yeah
oh sure
you retain employees and keep them longer that ' s that was the rationale they gave when they were giving us information about our employee assistance programs that
uh - huh
uh - huh
they want us to be happy and want us to be able to cope with trying to split ourselves in fifteen million pieces
right
right
so i hope it helps it seems to help the new mothers not have to come back full - time because that ' s hard
oh that ' s good
that ' s good to know i got a couple of friends that have found the
you know a private home to take their children to when they ' re young until they hit the preschool age and they
uh - huh
uh - huh
usually you know you ' ll find a woman that ' s keeping like six children or four to six children in the home and my future sister - in - law ' s mother does that too full - time
uh - huh
well in plano though the problem is you find and this is what i found with emily i from the time she started first grade i wanted her out in plano area
uh - huh
and i kept finding neighbors and friends and they ' d move she ended up being in a different home every year
oh too transit uh - huh
primarily with our local newspaper and tv
i listen to the radio but not
oh i see well that ' s that is one of the handicaps with both tv and
yeah
and radio if you ' re not available on the hour or half hour then you lose out on an awful lot well what is your newspaper
that is the washington post is that correct i have read that when we were in that area and it it ' s a splendid newspaper
right
um - hum
so what more do we need to discuss tonight that seems like a very short one
well i can discuss a lot of the news that we have but i feel that that ' s not part of our responsibility
right
what i mean hobbies do you enjoy
well lets see i suppose i could say i joy crocheting
gardening knitting
hiking
do you have a lot of spare time to do it in or is it something you kind of have to make time for
well it seems like i don ' t have time for them but i ' m i don ' t work full - time or anything
um - hum
i sell avon and stanley products
um - hum
but it ' s that ' s not
sometimes
yeah well i enjoy needlepoint although boy i guess i got myself burned out i did too much too fast and
uh - huh
for some reason my eyes aren ' t quite what they used to be either
oh
and
you sound young
yeah i am but i don ' t know it ' s just
maybe it ' s the light but
uh - huh
and
i enjoy photography as a hobby
oh good
uh - huh
um - hum
and bowling and right now my biggest hobby i guess since you know recovering is
watching television and playing nintendo with my son
yeah that could be a little boring sometimes i guess too but
and i do enjoy reading
uh - huh
i do read a lot read quite a lot
uh - huh
i enjoy reading different types of things
uh - huh
i enjoy reading novels
then you know
how old is your little
boy
today is his birthday yeah
oh is it really
oh how old
six
oh that ' s nice
do they live close by
just one of them
um - hum
my sister ' s going to have a baby this summer
uh - huh
so but i guess that ' s a little off the subject
i don ' t know i ' ve tried various things i ' ve tried to get interested in things like refinishing furniture woodworking or ceramics but it just seems like
it ' s so expensive to break into something new
um - hum
that you know with my i ' ve got enough of an investment in my photography equipment
yeah
that
we had for a while done well we still do a lot of picture taking in that and we ' re in the process of putting our eight millimeter
um - hum
films and now the kids and i were going to put them on video
oh yeah
and we ' re in the process of doing that right now and
are you doing that yourself
yeah
how do you do it
we bought the equipment
that you do it with
you don ' t have to
i mean is the something that you don ' t have to see it as you it ' s not like your
well the you buy this little piece of equipment and you use your video camera of course and your projector
um - hum
um - hum
oh okay that ' s what i wondered
and the combination you the way you know connect them up
do they make good quality copies do you think
i think it ' s going to we were a little worried there was a lot of background noise on it but
we can hook it into our stereo system after we get the pictures all done
um - hum
we can hook it into our a or stereo system and put music
to the film and that will cut out all the background the noise of the recorder running and that
yeah
oh
well that ' s nice
because the projector made a lot makes a lot of noise
yeah i remember those we ' ve never had one my parents never had one but
yeah
oh
that ' s my dream i guess is to have my own darkroom
yeah
the kids grow up and
they ' re expensive to maintain just the chemicals are expensive
yeah
we mainly just did a bit of black and white it ' s
yeah i would still like black and white
uh - huh
to me black and white is photography color is more snapshot
oh you can really get some good really good pictures in black and white
yeah you really can people don ' t realize that
that
um - hum
not realize that black and white it nowadays it ' s actually more expensive than color
um - hum
it ' s hard to even find film or anything
yeah
yeah
but
and i well i used to i learned how to knit when i was little my grandmother knitted a lot
uh - huh
and she knitted all the time
did she
and before she passed away and made some beautiful things but i ' ve never really learned how to do more than the basic
oh that ' s great
yeah
yeah i don ' t do a whole it time seems to be hard to find for anything you want to do i don ' t know why
um - hum
you
you ' d think i ' d have a lot time but
when ' s the baby due
time to get busy do you know if it ' s going to be a boy or a girl
i don ' t know
i don ' t know
they don ' t really care what they have
is it her first one
well
but i do enjoy it i enjoy painting some too but i
i really have trouble finding time i did some toll painting for a while and i started doing a still life and it ' s it never got finished
yeah
that ' s something i ' ve
it ' s interesting to me people who watch people who are that know how to paint i just felt like that ' s something i ' ve never been very good at or very good at drawing or anything
well had have you watched any of these things on tv these large brush
i ' ve watched i ' ve yeah here and there but they make it i know that
um - hum
well once you start it apparently it ' s not bad some of the girls have gone into the call age group claritin university is just not too far from here
um - hum
they ' ve gone in and done a class on the large brush and actually did the painting
yeah
and you know they ' ve never done anything
yeah i ' ve yeah and i know a girl that used to do it and hers did too but i just don ' t think see myself whipping out masterpieces in thirty minutes
like they do on the shows
do you enjoy cooking
yeah i like to cook
i like to cook but i ' ve really gotten away from it it ' s with just two my son and myself it ' s just not
yeah i don ' t do a lot of fancy cooking
to me it ' s just
he you know i hate you know hate to admit this but we live on frozen food
well it depends on what it is you know well now we i we have a small garden and i can i do canning
yeah they have
and
yeah i like gardening that ' s of course that ' s something i can ' t do with my back
yeah
and my back
that ' s too bad was it lower back or
yeah
my dad ' s grew up on a farm and he always had gardens and we always had fresh vegetables which i just really like and
um - hum
yeah that ' s one thing that our gardening we ' re getting it my husband he ' s retired but he ' s having
trouble now and he ' s not allowed to mow the grass we have a lot of grass takes me about four hours to do our lawn
oh you have to do it oh gosh
and things like that so it makes it a little bit
difficult but i do love to garden my kids loved it because i never allowed anybody in my garden that didn ' t like to do it
do you garden vegetables or flowers or both or mostly vegetables
yeah mostly vegetables i had grew some flowers but mostly vegetables
yeah there ' s nothing like fresh vegetables picked out of the garden
yeah
but
well it ' s been nice talking to you
yes well i hope you have a nice birthday today for your son
uh - huh
he knows today after the little something today because he knows it ' s his birthday to make it special but
uh - huh
yeah
well you have a nice day okay bye - bye
ready
okay what exactly we ' re talking about industries trends everything
social changes
well whatever i guess you want to whether things changed over the last twenty years
okay
all right we ' ll start twenty years back and come forward how ' s that sound
all right good enough here we go
all right
well let ' s see i guess some of the some of the things civil rights have come a long way i guess in the last twenty years
well yeah i think they have i really do and it ' s no longer the issue it once was and i ' m kind of glad least i hope that ' s a good sign that
yeah
yeah that ' s true
the times have changed to the more equitable at least
yeah and i guess i guess women ' s rights have come with that too i guess so that ' s
yeah i think they have too i don ' t think women ' s rights have come as far
probably not
i think that in general women would feel like they still sort of getting the bum deal
compared to say some of the minority groups
um - hum
yeah
yeah
if i recall back in the sixties we didn ' t tend to run a debt all the time but we did run a debt a lot with the great society a lot seventies and so forth
that ' s true
yeah
and then it looked like we just stayed in some sort of a economic morass ever since
hello we ' re there
okay that twenty five years ago that japan wasn ' t what it is now so that that ' s probably caused some changes
right i can
yeah i can remember in the late sixties early seventies you couldn ' t even hardly find a japanese car around
um - hum
and what few there were around were very ugly looking things must ' ve been
oh yeah like the old subarus and the old datsuns
yeah they must ' ve been pretty reliable though because some of them they built up a fairly good following and it appears that ' s the case do you own any kind of foreign car
um - hum
no we don ' t as a matter of fact
i don ' t either i ' ve always just i don ' t know whether you call it buy american it ' s just that i ' ve always bought fords and i guess i ' ll just keep buying fords
but what else what else has changed oh i guess watergate was in there so i guess politics in general has kind of kind of gone downhill
but
well
in the last because i can remember maybe before nixon that
the presidents were really up on a pedestal
some of the ethical aspects of political life certainly seem to have gone downhill and certain
yeah in certain respects i feel like that the
reagan administration coming right off the carter administration did tend to bring back a more aggressive
aspect to the human rights issues and the sort of things that democracy in this country has really stood for and you know and brought it back to the limelight compared to the sixties and seventies
yeah
um - hum
and i think that was a positive thing but it seems like
with all that we never seem to be able to get our house in order when it comes to the economic things i bring this back to that at least it seems like we still continue to run
heavy indebted budgets and the like i don ' t see any real way out of it either i might add
yeah
no i there ' s no easy answer that ' s for sure or else they would ' ve done something by now i guess
yeah well
yeah i think that ' s true
but
and probably the only other thing i can think of in the last oh twenty years or so i guess is that family structures have changed a lot
yeah i think they have too seems like that the country ' s been more migratory
um - hum that ' s true
and the old family structure of the mothers and the grandmothers and the grandfathers maybe even some great grandparents occasionally that seems to have been broken apart pretty well including the family structure as a unit itself
yeah
yeah it doesn ' t seem the norm to have parents and the two what two point five kids and all that
yeah well i hope that ' s not right i do i do hear these statistics same as you do and i always felt like at least the immediate family unit mother father and children
yeah
was a cohesive structure that was healthy and was a integral part of what made this country
i don ' t know sort of a stable country in terms of discipline i don ' t know some not necessary discipline but social order that ' s it and i
true
yeah
but it it ' s sad that we ' re losing the grandparents and the uncles that you know beyond that families don ' t seem to get close anymore
yeah
and that ' s probably got something to do with what you ' re saying about the migratory
yeah in my family i know most of us are southerners just happen to be living up in maryland though but my family we ' re
we sort of like our roots and like to get back and have family reunions and all that
yeah
yeah
and i think that may not be the norm for a lot of people as much as it is for us that don ' t want to do that
i think you ' re right i think that ' s very rare anymore that definitely people aren ' t at family reunions on a regular basis and a lot of them i guess don ' t do it at all so
yeah
because i know it ' s been a long time since our family ever did anything like that so
yeah
i must say too it seems like the whole flavor of war has changed considerably when you look at back at the vietnam era
that ' s true
and what all we went through there in terms of what ' s happened in the iraqi situation it seems like we have made a rather
major about face in terms of the way we conduct war and the way we can technologically carry out a war
um - hum
yeah i mean not
well then too i think the philosophy is changed i was just reading tonight in the one of the news magazines that you can take you know i take newsweek time and us news and world report all three as a matter of fact
uh - huh
and i was just reading in one of the those news magazines that there ' s a
a movement among certain members of the military establishment the upper hierarchy officer staff
to change the kind of way we conducted war in the past in terms of instead of meeting the enemy sort of head on instead of doing more feinting and technologically appropriate tactics like these smart bombs and things like that doing more
um - hum
more smart things that are very damaging getting in getting out making end runs allowing more creativity at the lower echelon levels for people to slip in slip out and do things
um - hum
than has been the case in the past where the idea was to meet your enemy sort of head on and the like and i think politically we ' ve changed a lot i think in the vietnam war
um - hum overpower them
we congress got too much involved in trying to manage the war
well it ' s probably because it lasted so long you know i guess it ' s
yeah and that that ' s absolutely the wrong way to go to conduct a war in my opinion when you when you ' re in a war right or wrong you should let the military establishment handle it and give them the job that they ' re paid and supposedly skilled at doing
yeah
um - hum
and let them get on with it instead of tying their hands which i felt like was not the case in the vietnam war but was entirely the opposite in the case of the iraqi war
where they more or less gave it to schwartzkopf and the rest of the military units and just says hey look handle it and they did
um - hum yeah
and i think the military proved itself competent to do exactly what it ' s paid to do and it just goes to give me a feeling that we did some things wrong
um - hum
i think in the vietnam era and that congress should have stayed out of it much as possible
um - hum
but that i see as a change and then industrially going back i think industrially we ' ve changed i think we ' ve come through an era of the last thirty years or so twenty ten of a
a nation that was industrially oriented towards manufacturing type industries and i think now we seeing ourselves transitioning into a more technological electronics age where it ' s
yeah
more of a
more information processing yeah
information and communication and computers that is really our next industrial revolution
and you know it wouldn ' t surprise me the least little bit if we didn ' t see the whole idea of manufacture of automobiles and the like except to some degree we have to keep a little bit of expertise in the house that being a base export to third world countries and you may might find even japan and
and major powers like the british and the central european economies being less and less dependent upon that kind of industry
because it ' s somewhat labor intensive even if they start robotizing it i i ' m concerned that would be the case instead the more
advanced nations would tend to get more computerized more telecommunication oriented and the like and information is getting to be sort of the thing
um - hum
yeah
no that ' s true that ' s true over the last twenty years that ' s a definite change and it ' s only going to only going to get worse i guess in the near future
um - hum yeah i think i think we ' re made some mistakes too for i think the education system in this country has not really kept abreast of what ' s going on industrially
um - hum
and i ' ll give you an example i was talking about i ' ve said for years because i my background ' s in physics and i ' ve said for years that the education system in this country has not reacted
um - hum
to what is the actual industrial evolutionary state of the country and by that i mean when i was going to school you got your basic sciences
um - hum
and that was pretty much about it
yeah
and when i got out of school i had to sort of teach myself everything i ' ve learned about computers and programming and just you know the whole bit hardware in general relative to why you can do things with data acquisition process and the like
um - hum
and when i was going to school you had to have mathematics if you were in engineering or science or any of the other scientific fields chemistry and biology and the like
um - hum
but you never had to have computers and even to this date in colleges it ' s not required to take computer courses if you ' re in the engineering or the science fields
um - hum
unless you ' re a computer scientist or someone in that area and then it is required of course because it ' s part of the curriculum and just as we have to take at least a year of english in colleges and a year of some sort of social study
or electrical engineering probably yeah
no i think that maybe the automation people that are
oh okay
we ' re discrete well are not discrete electronic devices
oh
oh and did he is he the one that got you connected with us
uh - huh
hum okay it ' s a lot of fun
yeah
you want to punch the button and go
sure you ready
yep
okay
well are you going to buy a car soon
well it won ' t be too much longer because my husband and i are both going to retire and when we retire we ' re going to buy us a you know a new one and get rid of the two that we have right now
and what are you going to buy
i do i don ' t know we ' re either gonna buy a pick up or we ' re gonna buy a van
or we ' re gonna buy an economy car how do you like that
well have you been listening to iaccoca ' s arguments that chrysler products are the only ones that all have airbags
yeah
does that make a difference to you
yeah it sure does i really would like to have something like that and i ' m hoping that by you know
that ' s like right now my husband would like for me to buy another vehicle right now
but i keep saying lets put it off lets put it off because i ' m hoping they ' ll get so many better features
yeah like what
well just like that air bag i think that thing is fantastic cause i ' ve seen some of the you know like the head on collision type things where they had it
yeah
and people walk away from it we had one here i guess it was about three weeks ago and the people walked away from the wreck with no scratches nothing you know a few bruises
that ' s nice
did
did you see the i don ' t know if it was 20 / 20 last thursday or friday night on seat belts
um - hum
did that scare you a little bit with the lady being thrown out
uh - huh
you got it i
and run over
i tell you what i would not i would not buy a car that had the seat belt where it was hooked under the door
that really i guess i that a little more than scared me that irritated me that because it
if it surely didn ' t come as a surprise that
that if the door came open the lady would fall out i mean and
well you know what the average person would you ever have thought of that
i mean now
you probably would not
for me it ' s a real it ' s a real consideration
and the but no i probably wouldn ' t have even though i ' m really quite into cars it ' s probably my main hobby
right
because you always think i mean i don ' t know maybe you don ' t but just like me
i always think well you know these things must be safe but that ' s just like i don ' t know if you ' ve heard about it a few years ago they said you know before they had the like the shoulder strap thing where it was just like a seat belt that goes across your waist
yeah
all these people were and it was on one of those kind of shows like 20 / 20 these people were like paralyzed and because it threw them forward but they were hooked at the waist and so it like you know did something to their spinal cord
uh - huh
yeah
then they were like paraplegics
yeah you know road and track had a had some articles on and particularly with backseat with some where kids were sitting in the backseat with seat belts on and they were thrown forward
into the front seat and there was enough stretching the combination of stretching the spine to i mean to serious injury even though they were they were still locked in the forced to go so really if your sitting in the backseat
right
you ' re better off not to have your seatbelt on if it ' s just a seatbelt we have a van that just has seat belts in the back doesn ' t have a shoulder harness
yeah
well tell me about your van do you like it
i have an arrow star van we really do it ' s a mini van we ' ve had it goodness in may will be five years and they replace the engine at sixty thousand under extended warranty
and the transmission was replaced but they really are nifty
the mini van it ' s actually we had a station wagon before and it ' s a foot or two shorter than a we had a regular size station wagon
um - hum
and it really
huh the reason that we ' re thinking about something like that we took a trip in my brother in law and sister in laws to florida
uh - huh
and like i said i mean we ' re not that old but my husband works for the state and after a certain amount of years you can retire
uh - huh
yeah
well but the did you did you go to florida in a van
uh - huh and we wanted to travel well that was really nice traveling but you know i like to know more
i mean hear about more people that have things like that you know and see what they think of them the different kinds because i ' ve only ridden in the one that ' s it
yeah
yeah
which what kind was it
shoot i can ' t even think of the name of it now
what was remarkable this van even with the we have two kids and we went to disney world
uh - huh
actually i grew up in alabama and i went to see my mother and then went on down to disney world and it got better than i think twenty two twenty three miles a gallon and this was with the air conditioner on and you know
yeah
four people with luggage and course this grant it that ' s you know it ' s been four years ago but it ' s remarkable that the that the bigger vans they ' re
my boss just bought a pick up truck and he only gets seventeen miles a gallon
yeah
but it has a big engine and it pulls a boat and stuff but it ' s and it it ' s got the seats that and the other thing that is interesting is it has rear air conditioning
uh - huh
and that makes a lot of difference in those of us that live in warm climates
yeah well now this one that we went in it did baby what kind of van was that we went to florida in
a what
a ford what you remember
he was trying to think of what the name of it was
well the big you know the big vans are all real nice
this was a big one i mean it was a big one it had the it had the front and the back and you know it has the backseat let down into a double i mean a queen size bed and then it had the two swivels in the middle and then
yeah
oh those are
yeah
yeah
the two swivel chairs on the front
all right
and i mean it was fantastic and it got good gas mileage but
they
i don ' t know i don ' t really
i don ' t i want something i can drive too you know and i was scared to drive that big van
well
well the mini the you ' d be surprised if you drive a one of the mini vans fact there all more or less alike the chevrolet and well of course oldsmobile has got one and chryslers got one but they drive remarkably like cars
well do you does yours have that this one had it where you know you would see something coming in the rear view mirror i mean not the rear those little side mirror things and it would look like it was further back than it was
yeah
yeah but the little thing etched in it say objects are closer than they appear or something
yeah does yours do that too oh i was wondering if all vans did that
yeah
well you can you can install those mirrors we ' ve got the big side mirrors which are really nice i don ' t know if you ' ve well if you ' ve driven a pick up truck you know these are these mirrors are must be six inches across not nearly a foot high
uh - huh
and they really nice i ' m on both sides actually they fold so when you get in tight situations you can fold them back
yeah well see that ' s the reason that we couldn ' t make really make them at first we were going to get a pick up truck with a camper on the back of it but then that gas mileage was just atrocious i mean it ' s unreal it ' s
but there
uh - huh
um - hum
you just practically don ' t get any
well they have got some of the newer ones they you know with the aerodynamic features you can get pretty decent gas mileage
yeah and then he talked about a van and i said well you know i don ' t know i don ' t know how the gas is on most of these
and another thing was that ' s the reason i said you know there was such a big difference you know in a little economy car but i said maybe we might have to get us an economy car to pull along
oh
uh - huh
when we went somewhere but really and truly the safety features but i wouldn ' t get one that if it had the seat belts on the door now i wouldn ' t get it period
yeah
yeah interesting enough ford announced that i think in ninety two they ' re going to put air bags in their in their vans
oh that would be good
surprisingly they ' re you really need to do you need a combination of both the air bags and the
oh i think so too i don ' t think they should do away with the seat belts now i ' m but i think you need the shoulder thing i think you need the thing around your waist but i think you need that bag to pop out too
and your seatbelt so
yeah
yeah
you know because i know so many people
here that have been killed in head on collisions where maybe if they had they had that air bag they may still be walking around
yeah
yeah
but i think it ' s fantastic i wish they required it in everything every new car that came out i wish they would require it in it
it would be interesting to see what that ' d do to our insurance rates
you know if the insurance companies says it says we ' re not going to pay you know a claim if the car doesn ' t have air bags
would be interesting wouldn ' t it that wouldn ' t be fair but
yeah
well no because what they would do is that ' s what they ' re going to plan on you know they would have to do it the insurance company would have to do the same thing they ' re given like a ten year time limit
yeah
where okay these cars i guess they figure all the old cars will be off the roads or something by the in ten years
yeah
and then you know if you didn ' t have a car that had one in it then your insurance would go up enormously
i ' ve got to go my son ' s in a performance tonight i have to leave in a couple of minutes i think we ' ve probably spent a reasonable amount of time
oh that ' s okay
okay
my goodness that ' s unusual
well do you have any children or are you in college
mine well mine are grown and of course i ' ve already been through this with them
and i guess i ' ll have to help with grandchildren one of these days i hope
certainly and where did your children go to college
well that ' s great
and one of them ended up at el centro in one of the specialized programs and another one is putting herself through right now back at utd
i see
well that ' s great i ' m the director of admissions at utd
well
how far is it from home i had to put in and then course we also had to include how much is it gonna cost
well you ' re going right down my list the first thing that i always talk to students about is the academic program because if we don ' t have what you ' re looking for it isn ' t gonna do you any good no matter how bad you wanna come here
yeah
that ' s true that ' s true
and cost is always usually next on the list especially for the parents and financial assistance and scholarships
um - hum
and usually then we talk a little bit about the size of the school and different types of organizations and activities that they can get involved in and of course distance from home and size of classes and
um - hum
it sounds like from your experience you know how to go right down the list with them
well you have to be practical because i know our first daughter went to stephen f austin
and her allergies acted up in the piney woods and it was too far from home and she got lonesome and that didn ' t work out for her so i guess i learned on that one
yeah you know it ' s interesting especially when my experience has always been at a public university
and a lot of the students in that home town sometimes shun the idea of staying and going to school across the street so to speak
um - hum
but it always seems like at the beginning of the year they ' re talking about well i ' m going to this state and i ' m getting out of here and i ' m going way over there
um - hum
um - hum
um - hum
sure
oh
well we ' ll have to give them the pass key i guess do you have more than the one daughter to plan for
i have a daughter that ' s a seventh grader and then i have a son that ' s a sophomore at shepton high school
okay
and so it ' s been interesting watching them sign up for appropriate course work and things and they ' re on the college bound track at least
um - hum well
that ' s good do you find that the boy is going in a different direction than the girl as far as what his needs are and the type of college he wants
well they certainly have two different personalities but in terms of needs the older son is interested in the medical field
well yeah
good
and at this particular point you know taking appropriate course work but really nothing that ' s in out of the ordinary
um - hum
and the daughter has indicated that she wants to get a degree in
hi how you doing
good
yes we do right here at the at the very building they have a nurse ' s office
uh - huh
and i haven ' t
my name hasn ' t come up yet how about you
yeah i have what i ' ve found out of curiosity was my name has come up twice and we ' ve only been involved with the program say about a year
right
and when i when i first heard about it i was very defensive i didn ' t think it was something that the companies ought to be doing
right
because i felt that i was losing something or taking something away from me
yeah but now that it ' s happening i
i feel comfortable with it i don ' t feel as though i ' ve lost anything and that i feel secure in that i know that everybody that works
around me
is drug free
i have a similar opinion at first i
wasn ' t sure
but
then
i thought it was a good thing for the company as well
how about how about where
um - hum
saying that it ' s a violation of my rights and this and that and the tests aren ' t accurate and
but i think they ' ve got that testing down to a real science where you know they don ' t you know
i ' m sure you saw the video on how they do the testing and it it ' s almost impossible i think to
to make a mistake
well i was involved in the in the initial training program because i had to go out and teach or explain to other people
what we were doing why we were doing it so i guess i had a little first hand knowledge of
right
of seeing the films i had more of extensive training in background information of the reasons why they were doing it the cost that
right
that we projected that it that it actually cost companies by having people be involved with drugs
who were
oh yeah
and
how do you feel about other things like public safety buses bus drivers and airplane drivers or
pilots rather
you
oh taking drug testing
yeah
oh sure i think that ' s
i feel that you know for certain cases that i that i am willing to give up my rights
to secure the rights of others i guess is what i ' m saying
yeah
when the public whole ah is at stake
well i
then i ' m willing to you know personally i can ' t speak for others but for myself i ' m willing to say okay you know
if i see this is a right to if to privacy i ' m willing to give up that right
because i can see that it ' s
public good is at stake and the company good is at stake and
you know if they can get this thing under control you know it it ' s going to save us all money
as far as benefits and everything else you know insurance and everything else in this country
yeah the i ' ve always felt that public people who are involved with the safety of other people should be drug tested i ' ve i never said that i didn ' t want that the problem that i had was
right
whether my coworker is on drugs or not has does not have an influence on my safe well - being
right you don ' t work in an area where there ' s chemicals or machinery or things like that but
no so i had
right
and they don ' t have any of that up here but you know
i guess it ' s just the productivity
and the number of sick days i guess
and that they
that they accrue
right well i think they would you know someone on drugs probably misses more work
and then i guess that ' s why this smoking thing came out too
you know i ' ve gone to those classes unfortunately for me i ' m a smoker and i saw the statistics that came out on
smokers typically have more time out of work they ' re more prone to accidents and all of those other things and
when they ' re and that ' s why i guess the car insurance has no nonsmoker rates or whatever as well
for automobile insurance i had no idea
yeah
that they were doing that i know that they originally talking about health
oh yeah
they
at least down here in texas they have
nonsmoker they call them discounts
uh - huh
they give you if you ' re a nonsmoker i guess there is some kind of studies that show
but if you ' re smoking
you ' re not as attentive
that ' s different i ' ve never heard of that how about the
the smoking premium
out in texas i understand they started doing that
that ' s yeah i guess that takes effect in
june july
when june july yeah
yeah that they from what i understand that notices went out to all of the sites
right there was a lot of controversy about that too i ' m not a i ' m not a smoker myself
yeah
well that ' s the problem that ' s you don ' t how about do you do you like french fries
yeah i ' d probably get upset
then you would get upset it ' s what they ' re doing is they ' re nibbling at the population piece by piece
yeah
right
and now they know that the number or percentage of smokers is less than the people who do not smoke then they can go ahead and do that
right
right
right if they i assume if they
i guess they ' re saying with the cigarettes though that they ' ve been able to show that it ' s the number one
leading cause of preventable
preventable
preventable death not yeah but
death in this country was a half a million people a year or so dying with smoke relating smoking related
yeah but isn ' t the insurance also for blue cross
so they ' re not only saying not preventable death they ' re also saying
that you ' ll have less likelihood of being sick if you don ' t smoke
uh - huh
and we do have one smoker in our area who and he
he seems to miss a lot of work
but
is he an older person
forty
well that
eight maybe
that ' s not too old
yeah forty five forty eight
yeah and he and he does miss a lot of work
yeah but then there ' s people you talk to and say i ' ve never been sick a day in my life you know so i guess i guess you know the studies show as an average
yeah
not specific cases and
yeah
i thought well with you know if that ' s really true then
then i guess i agreed with the extra premium
if it i mean if they can come along and prove that french fries
were the same deal then they have a right to charge for that too i guess
well
what do you mean if they can prove it there there ' s already
yeah that it ' s a major cause of early
right
well it depends if they ' re cooked in
see one of the things that will determine whether they ' re able to do that or not is not their ability to prove that it is unhealthy because we all know that french fries are not healthy for you it ' s the it ' s the capability of detecting it
yeah
right
right
right it it ' s the it ' s the honor system isn ' t it
it ' s the honor system i know it ' ll be an interesting experiment to see how
but i think in time come you ' re going to see that happening you ' re going to see where the high risk people pay a premium but they have to find a way to prove it
yeah
right
right well i think the same way with alcohol too
personally it you know that would probably be the next
yeah
the next thing
i mean
but you know there ' s the difference because they say you know
i guess they say tobacco is addictive i guess they say alcohol is addictive as well
but yeah but there are more drinkers than smokers if you think about it
oh yeah that ' s
there is oh there is
and drinking is still socially acceptable where smoking is socially unacceptable today and so that there ' s a big difference so that so that they really can ' t make a change in policy about drinking until
right
right
right
yeah well it ' s part of the business world too when you make
deals you know a lot of times it ' s
three martini lunch or whatever they say
so i guess you can you can classify alcohol as a drug so is a cigarette in my opinion where it ' s not i don ' t think people that are that are smoking are doing it voluntarily i think they ' re doing it involuntarily
right
i know i am i don ' t know anybody in their right mind that says that i ' m doing it because i want to i
yeah
yeah
makes me feel better
well i do i do make that statement i say i do it because i like it but i can ' t say i ' m doing it because i want to i ' m doing it because i have to or my desire is greater than
right
the nicotine addiction yeah
yeah i have my in - laws are both smokers and they ' ve tried to quit
numerous times and
uh - huh
and i think the longest they ' ve made it is about three months and then they go to a friend ' s house or something and there they ' re all smoking and
and they break yeah they just can ' t stand it you know all of a sudden they get it ' s overwhelming and then they break down and then they say i ' m a failure and then they just give up you know
start up again
i started when i was younger and
it was prior to the time that the risks were known
were known yeah
so
well i think we ' ve probably talked long enough
okay nice talking to you
well i can tell you ' re from you ' ve got that new england accent
does that mean you ' re in new
i ' m in the
attleboro massachusetts plant
massachusetts
yeah
yeah i have
okay what kind of music do you like
well i several years ago a radio broke in my car and i never i got out of the habit of listening to the radio and so
um - hum
too many of the most popular songs are unless you know they ' re in the news or something but so i tend to listen to some of the older
um - hum
songs that were popular back when i was paying attention and then i like some classical music and some of the
um - hum
pieces that have been around a while i haven ' t paid much attention to most of the current music what about you
i listen i listen to a wide variety of music sometimes i ' ll turn on the classical music sometimes i ' ll listen to jazz every now and then country and western
um - hum
i ' ll listen to some of the rock stations i also like the classic rock stations that play the older more mellow type
uh - huh
rock music some of the some of the rock stations now are the i guess the top forty stations or whatever they just it really gets on my nerves because they play so many commercials and
um - hum
sometimes the deejays are just kind of annoying and irritating and it gets kind of old and they play the same songs over and over and i just get kind of tired of all that
that ' s true
um - hum
so lots of times i ' ll just play cassettes instead of listening to the radio actually but most of my cassettes i guess i don ' t i don ' t like hard rock
no
i have some rock and some jazz and couple of maybe one or two country and western some
oh i can ' t believe i can ' t think of his name garth brooks i have a couple of his tapes
uh - huh
and
but it ' s mainly it ' s mainly just the light rock type stuff
um - hum
music to listen to but and i back a long time ago when the rap music first came out it was kind of a novelty and i listened to some of it but i you know now that there ' s just a million rap groups and
um - hum
um - hum
um - hum
and they try to tend to try to do outdo each other with raciness i think and
oh yeah
so i you know i ' m not attracted to that at all but it made a big difference in my life not to have a radio that was a easy access and so now that i do have one i just don ' t automatically turn it on
um - hum
unless there ' s something i ' m particularly listening to but you know if you go two or three years without having that what i got the most exposure to
um - hum
it really changed my lifestyle and kept me from
just having a you know easy access to current music and so i did like i say tend to go back to
albums and cassettes and things that i had already had purchased but we don ' t have a cd yet do you
um - hum
um - hum
no i don ' t
i sure don ' t because i have so many albums and cassettes i feel like gosh i have to go out and buy a cd player and then start collecting cds and it just i haven ' t gotten around to doing it yet
uh - huh
yeah i kind of decided to wait until it was around a while it was kind of like remember when personal calculators first came out and they were really expensive and then now you can get one for two or three dollars
yeah
uh - huh
sure and also they get better quality and they learn to have more features and things and without and making them less expensive so we ' re kind of waiting
um - hum
um - hum
to like now you know and the price of cassettes has gone down because cds are so popular so
um - hum
that ' s and a cd is a lot more expensive than a cassette ever was too right now i think
i haven ' t even priced them i guess they must be
they ' re somewhere between ten and fifteen dollars a piece
yeah
i bought some at christmas time for friends of mine that have cd players i thought my gosh now i know another reason why i ' m not going to get a cd player for a while
uh - huh
take our time well i can ' t imagine you can ' t record on them and so
right
they won ' t be as functional as like a cassette player where if you heard something
you could record it you know if you have i guess if you wanted to record something to play out in your car or something that you ' d heard or that you owned an album of so cds won ' t be nearly as handy
um - hum
uh - huh
yeah see i ' ve got a on my stereo i ' ve got a turntable and then i ' ve got a dual cassette so i can record off other cassettes
um - hum
but i never realized you couldn ' t record onto i just never really thought about it because i haven ' t really looked into it very much i don ' t have one and i ' ve never really looked at one very closely but that would be inconvenient because i have a cassette player in my car now i guess
uh - huh
until they now my sister my younger sister has a she does have a cd player that she got for christmas and she ' s got the cassette so she can record off cassettes onto cds i mean i ' m sorry other way around off cds onto cassettes
uh - huh
uh - huh
well that ' s good
so i can record some things from her and you know get cassettes and record off other ones or off the radio if i want to but
um - hum
but i just haven ' t gone to cd yet
why we haven ' t either but we you know we like the
the idea of having great extra quality you know in your music and things but i ' m satisfied to just have what i ' ve been used to not have to think about the great financial
um - hum
um - hum
sacrifice that would be to suddenly try to switch over to all cds or something but i know one thing that has colored my music choice is
um - hum
when we had children i really started to think about what kind of television programs i was watching and what kind of music i was listening to and activities because you know i just didn ' t want them to be exposed to
right
um - hum
a lot of things and a lot of the lot of the songs have some lyrics that i just wasn ' t pleased with you know
um - hum and so i really think we ' ve tried to tone down
um - hum
our taste there to make you know our children not be exposed to so many negative things so early in life
um - hum
well that ' s amazing how i used to when i was in college i used to have the stereo on all the time or i had on mtv or something but ever since i ' ve been out of college
um - hum
i guess over the last several years
uh - huh
right
and then i listen to it when i ' m in the car driving to work because again there ' s you know there ' s nothing else going on i might as well listen to the radio while i ' m driving to work but other than that i ' ve i really don ' t
right
i don ' t listen to the radio or even to my albums or cassettes or anything very often anymore i guess i ' m just too busy doing other things that it ' s
too much trouble to get up and go decide what i want to listen to and put it on the on the turntable i don ' t know i just don ' t bother to do it very much anymore
yes i know what you mean i know my husband he
plays an instrument and he played in the band when he was in college and in high school and so he has a lot of all different kinds of music and he goes out of his way to play marching band music or
um - hum
like you say jazz or classical to the children to give them some exposure to different kinds of music and i think that ' s really good because they ' re learning to like all different kinds and
um - hum
that ' s good what instrument does he play
he plays the it ' s a euphonium it ' s like a small
a really small not a tuba but
i it ' s hard to explain i never had known anyone to play one before but it ' s kind of like a small tuba but it ' s not the kind that sits up on your shoulder
um - hum
uh - huh i ' ve never heard of that
uh - huh
but it ' s a cross between a tuba and an and you know a horn it ' s a brass instrument
um - hum
so he plays that and a little bit of piano and
uh - huh
but he has some real fond memories of marching band and
um - hum
concert band type
um - hum oh i ' m sure it is i ' m sure it is i was exposed to a lot of music when i was younger i my parents had me take piano lessons for eight years and
um - hum
so i was i was a real good piano player but then i got interested in a lot of other things and i got real involved in many things and
and now i don ' t have a piano in my apartment or anything i could sit back down and play a few things but not like i used to be able to it ' s kind of sad that i ' ve let that slip away
um - hum
um - hum
okay i guess probably the first thing we could start off with is
oh that ' s a very interesting question the answer that i have is no in fact i was selected for jury at one time but fortunately for me or unfortunately just depending on your perspective
uh - huh
um - hum
i had already changed jurisdictions and so i had to reply that i couldn ' t do it
right
i just recently retired from the army and so when we moved to this area here i got selected for jury duty as did my wife and it was an interesting experience i ' d never done it before and
was it civil or criminal
this was all civil
although i did have a chance at a criminal one they actually had to interview like about a hundred and fifty people
get together a jury because there had been so much publicity about it but i was not selected for that one i would have been interesting i think
that ' s a hard question
yeah well on the one hand there ' s a lot of positive things you ' re not at the whim of one person who might have a grudge or a
right um - hum
on the other hand
well
juries are not legally experts and they often just feel bad for somebody
right
um - hum
but which is right they should often especially for example in a civil case
they ' ll feel bad for the person who got injured and not take into account any of the legal aspects of the incident and award large damages that were really undeserving from a legal point of view
right and it meant um - hum
right
course you ' re as a juror to you ' re
you ' re really at the mercy of the lawyers
because you don ' t know what really went on
and you can never depend on anybody telling the truth
and you ' re kind of at the mercy of the various lawyers who are
examining and cross examining the witnesses and they ' re
so it ' s really tough and one of the things when i was on the jury that bothered me was the fact that i was holding in my hands possibly the life of that individual
and when you got right down to it
you i really never knew who was really telling the truth and who wasn ' t
you can ' t you can ' t go by what the lawyer is saying pretty much and you don ' t know if the witnesses are being truthful even though they are sworn to tell the truth
right
the trial was stupid these people were supposedly adults you ' d think they could have worked their problems out
we had to sit there and listen to all the dumb things that they did and i felt sometimes like saying why don ' t you people just
you ' re supposed to be adults why don ' t you get with the program and work out your problems instead of having to go through all this in front of a jury it just seemed it just seemed dumb at the time
yeah well it ' s hard you get when you get involved emotionally in somethings
right
so it
it ' s an awful responsibility but it ' s like voting and all the other things that we ' re responsible for it ' s
all the civic duty yeah
one of those things you have to do i guess
well i think one of the problems that we have here in the united states and the question didn ' t seem to focus on civil things they more focus on criminals
right
but from my perspective one of the problems is that in our bill of rights
uh - huh
we have it written that even for civil cases everyone ' s guaranteed a right to a jury as long as the dispute is for more than twenty five dollars
right
um - hum
now twenty five dollars at the time that they wrote the bill of rights was a lot different than what it is now
yeah that was a lot of money
and
basically what it means is they try to say you know like petty things you don ' t get a jury and nowadays that same twenty five dollars might be i don ' t know
um - hum
right
ten thousand dollars i ' m not exactly sure the economics involved
well yeah what the value would be equal to today
that ' s right and it makes it very
yeah
oh most cases most small cases for civil suits really shouldn ' t even have the option of a jury
um - hum yeah
i know we i was involved in a suit where the
you know long time ago there was an accident whatever and an ambulance chaser came by and wanted you know i don ' t know five or ten thousand dollars
right
and they requested a trial by jury
uh - huh
and it seemed like really stupid that they should even have that option for such a small amount that our founding fathers didn ' t understand the economic principles involved
hm
um - hum
the
okay
i wake up to it in the morning this is my i guess my prime time for news first thing in the morning while i ' m getting ready to go to work
oh i
quite frequently glance through headlines or in the newspaper
but primarily mine is tv news
how about yourself
pretty interesting yeah i have to have to agree with you
normally don ' t have time in the morning to watch the any type of tv usually catch it going to work on the radio
true
we have a one year old in the house so it ' s kind of hard sometimes to watch tv during the during the during the night but i usually try to catch the ten o ' clock or
those type of issues i ' d have to say during the war there were we were the american public was probably flooded with
uh - huh
too much information and as far as the sub question about was i am i satisfied with the coverage i ' d have to say
yes but when it came to the war issues it was like who ' s telling the truth you between the channels there was
the casualties were differently the amount of missiles launched were different and it was almost too much information over - communicated
well that ' s true but i
trying to interpret the news to the best of their abilities since they were not very well informed by the military
true i agree with you
now i can appreciate that especially after what happened in vietnam
but
i mean let ' s face it today ' s means of communications we could very well a newscaster could very well give away a
piece of top secret information
um - hum
and
pat himself on the back for
making a big scoop
yeah that ' s a good point but i would have to say across the board i ' m satisfied with the way
yes
yeah
yeah i agree with you i i ' m glad you mentioned that because i think i have to since i don ' t have the opportunity in the morning i ' ll probably catch the head lines on t news that ' s a good point
of course t news is more or less headlines i don ' t think much of their sports coverage
um - hum
all they give the scores
yeah least
but that ' s right i ' m not
yeah outside of pro football i ' m not too interested in other sports anyway
um - hum
but the t news is a good way to keep up to date i think they do a pretty good job selecting the most important items
well that ' s great
yeah i do surely do
anything else cross your mind i guess most of us go by the audio which is the television or the radio
uh - huh
yeah but you need to continue to read so you can people learn to read you know
well i spent twenty years in commercial broadcasting ten in radio and then ten in tv
and i know what it takes to get some of those little bits of bits and pieces of news on the air
hm
i mean there are times where reporter actually will risk is life and limb i ' ve seen it happen time and time again
hm
for some reason because he was carrying a camera
they left him alone
um - hum
nice talking to you too jim
did you get your catalog on your gifts
no
yeah they ' re not to shabby they ' re pretty good
is that right well good
okay i think that in this day and age everyone needs to have some sort of exposure to community service
because it seems like and i ' m thinking of the of community of people that are in jail now i think that maybe if
if some of those people had gotten exposed to the community gotten exposed to working with other people that some of the things that they did they would not have done because they understand people more they understand helping people more they understand the plight of people
that ' s true um - hum i agree with you in the sense that i think that it ' s important for people to also share give something of themselves
uh - huh
right
and i think that there ' s too much
in the in a way of like self - gratification today
um - hum
and there ' s not enough sharing
um - hum i would think that for like people that are just filthy rich
uh - huh
i think that they would benefit also in doing community service so that they
can see and i ' m speaking about people that are like born rich
yeah uh - huh
and that ' s all they know and i ' m thinking that community service would help them just get a feel of what else is out there how other people are living you know if they were to work in
yeah
i don ' t know in a soup kitchen or something they would understand how other people live
yeah
uh - huh
and you know on the same note if poor if
i don ' t know they probably have a better perspective of i don ' t know just life itself
yeah and i think the peace corps is great too because it you go to different countries and you see
um - hum
you know in fact i saw an interview on tv the other night with patrick swayze and he ' s making a movie in
um - hum
i think it ' s
calcutta or either india somewhere where it ' s a it ' s a very poor country
um - hum
um - hum
and he said that people in the west
he said since being there and i guess he ' s been there about six months he said that his whole idea of what ' s important has changed
um - hum
and he said that people have no idea he said of what human sacrifice is you know since being there he ' s learned to what it is to be poor and have nothing and yet those people have
such a happy
um - hum demeanor yeah um - hum
yeah in other words they don ' t dwell on what they don ' t have they dwell on what they do have and they ' re happy with each other type of thing
right
uh - huh
that ' s great
and he said that out here he said that when he comes back he knows that it it ' s completely changed his life
um - hum and i think that you know this on the same note
being he was exposed to that and maybe he wasn ' t before and now he sees and i think that anybody that works
right
exactly
in the in some kind of service or for the community or something they can see you know you don ' t see what you don ' t you can ' t know what you don ' t see
uh - huh
exactly right
you know so and you have to experience some things you know a lot of people know that people that other people are poor
yeah
but you they don ' t know what poor is
right
unless they actually see it and you know help or something
uh - huh
well i know that it that must be true especially if you do something along the lines of you know helping them learn how to survive how to plant how to find water and i ' ve seen so many
um - hum
um - hum
extraordinary things on tv that people have done
um - hum
working in the peace corps and how you know the people or the community they worked in is so much better
um - hum
it ' s like one person can make a difference
right
and i really believe that they can in something like that
there ' s something i i ' ve really been skeptical of you know when you watch television you ' ll see the service announcement for children in other countries
uh - huh
and if you want to send like you know fifty cents a day
yes
or something like that and you can help a child
uh - huh
it ' s
i don ' t know i guess it ' s just me but i don ' t know whether to trust that or not
i mean there are so many scams and things going on you know i would love to help somebody
i know
yeah
you know but i just i can ' t bring myself to
trust
right
this company who ' s trying to do this or whatever it is
uh - huh
you know just because people are so i don ' t know just today people are just so money hungry that i think they would do anything
i know
it ' s true it really is it ' s the sad life i think today it ' s
and so i mean you don ' t know what they
um - hum
it ' s it it ' s not like it used to be even in the years of my growing up i mean i ' m fifty three years old and i have seen a town change from a town to a city
um - hum
um - hum
um - hum
and it ' s people you know grow from a small town to a large town
um - hum
and you would think that more people would be better you know share more do more you know be more community oriented and all but if they just get more
um - hum
right
unto themselves kind of
yeah more self - centered
right and it ' s not the sharing of a neighbor to a neighbor
um - hum
um - hum
um - hum
and not even worry about it
but you can ' t do that today
but today i mean you know it ' s like you wouldn ' t even think of doing that
uh - huh
um - hum
if you don ' t have bars on the window you ' re not even safe you know
yeah even when i first moved to dallas from new york it seemed like dallas was so open you know everybody left their doors open you just run in the store you leave your car running
uh - huh
yeah
yeah
you know and this was only well i guess it has been awhile it ' s been almost ten years since i moved here and it ' s amazing now how much it ' s changed i mean i don ' t go out i don ' t go outside at night you know
yeah
in dallas they
i was going to say because i heard in fact i was talking to someone from dallas just last weekend they was saying that in fact it was this one girl particularly that worked for ti and she had gone overseas to tokyo
um - hum
um - hum
and she asked them there if there was some anywhere that she shouldn ' t go because she was alone you know being a girl from another country and everything
um - hum
um - hum
and she said they thought for a few seconds and they said no there ' s nowhere that you can go that you would have to be afraid
they said to her that even if she left her purse
hum
on the subway
um - hum
okay that she would have that purse returned to her
this is how confident they were okay with nothing missing
wow
wow
okay this is a foreign country
better
um - hum
and you would think you know being an american or whatever you know a foreigner there that would be all the more reason that they ' d take advantage of you
um - hum
oh
god that would be the exact opposite here i mean if you leave something anywhere you might as well forget it
okay
and she told me she said she could tell them for fifteen minutes places not to go in and around dallas
um - hum
um - hum
and that ' s where she was from
um - hum that is sad
she said even choosing her apartment she had to be so careful because of being a woman alone
yeah that ' s a big that ' s a big thing with me i live in a one bedroom i ' m single
you know she had there are certain
uh - huh
and i ' ve i could live in an apartment i live in waco okay and you either live in really low priced housing or you live on the other side of town in the high price apartments
oh yeah
yeah
and i live i don ' t make a lot of money but i live in the high price apartments simply because i feel safe here
yeah
and i pay i ' m paying probably the hundred or hundred and fifty dollars more
than i would be paying somewhere else but i wouldn ' t be able to sleep at night and that to me is worth the extra money for me to be you know i feel very safe where i am
yeah
yeah
yeah
you know instead of
and that that ' s why i think if people were more exposed to
um - hum
especially young kids getting out of high school
um - hum
i mean at one time they would go into the service to have the same exposure and you know to further their worldliness so to speak
um - hum
right
and go to see foreign countries that they would not necessarily be able to afford to see it was like they said join the navy to see the world type of thing you know
um - hum
right
but nowadays they don ' t do that anymore it ' s not a thing a lot of young men don ' t even
um - hum
have the desire to go into the service
yeah they don ' t even consider it
or to you know do something for someone else
um - hum yeah and it
and i don ' t know i attributed i think a lot of that to women working
to
you know to the mothers not being at home
yes i was talking to someone yesterday about that and we were saying that the basic the basic family is disrupted these days
the bonding process yep
it very definitely is
and so i think you know before the father would work and the mother you know would stay home and having that mother there that base i think was a big part of family big part of
that ' s right
of what you know your youngsters thought about what they did you know
yep
and the thing is like i think a man can afford to support a woman
but the woman affords the luxuries
um - hum
in other words like anyone can live on a certain income no matter what it is you have to
um - hum
right
right
so to speak okay it it ' s what ' s important to you
um - hum
now a family i think that like girls today have children and six weeks later they ' re back to work
um - hum
right
they don ' t even have a bonding with that child they don ' t ever see the
um - hum
it ' s the most beautiful thing that happens between a mother and a child the first like say six years of life
um - hum
um - hum
so much happens in that period of time
when i called
and i mean once the child ' s in school if you had a job from say nine to three
um - hum
big deal i mean they ' re in school you ' re at work that ' s great but it ' s kids that come home and don ' t have a mother there or the kids are at home in the morning and the
okay the change how women ' s roles have changed
yes
with the economy and with the dysfunctional families
yes
yes but i think it causes a lot of dysfunction in the family
women going out to work
possibly you know if they ' re doing it simply
for the money
if it ' s something that they need to fulfill themselves then that ' s something different too
yeah
that they should have the opportunity to do it and the quote homemaker ' s role should be divided equally between the partners
i do too when it ' s a necessity i know but it ' s funny how it ' s changed because when my mother
well she took one year of normal school and then she taught school for three years before she met my father and they married and she had to quit teaching school because she was a married woman
so it it ' s changed a lot from then
um - hum
one thing that has not changed is
is the equality of pay among the sexes
right
and i don ' t see any great hope for that being changed in the near future quite frankly
but if you look at the people who make the decisions
the senate and the house they ' re primarily male
um - hum
um - hum
and
parent
parent well a single person my children are grown and married but i still have to support myself
um - hum
and i you know i personally i don ' t work because i want to get out there and do it i work because if i want to eat i ' m out there working
um - hum
well i think that makes a big difference and i think it makes a big difference too if after your children are raised you want to go out and fulfill yourself
well i did i didn ' t work while my children were young and i was married because i did want to give them the background that they got at home i did find afterwards though
um - hum
um - hum
or working parent were more independent
um - hum
most of them
are working and it ' s not to buy the tvs and the new cars it ' s to survive
yes i definitely think so and especially in those families that the husband does not have a college education
well even you know here our teachers are paid so poorly
and i don ' t know of any teacher whose wife is not having to work
so it ' s not just the men without a college education it ' s
our economy is really bad right now in oklahoma it ' s real bad
yes
uh - huh
we ' ve been there we ' ve been here for about three to five years now and it ' s really hurting
uh - huh
after having served on the jury and come to a decision
and then the first thing that was done was after we found him guilty
his attorney jumped up and started going through the you know routine for filing an appeal
which you know i know that that ' s the right but the defendant but i mean it makes you wonder why go through it one more time when you know he admitted he was guilty of the crime
so i don ' t know that it was a little bit disgruntling to me
it
right i have never served on a jury i have been called like only twice in my life and
at the time i ' ve been a legal assistant and nobody wanted me on their jury so i ' ve been excused but
i don ' t know i look at the people who get excused and it ' s supposed to be a jury of your peers and i ' m not sure it always is
right
and it is a it is a huge burden to put on people who don ' t know the law
you know that especially in criminal cases when you ' re deciding someone ' s life
uh - huh
i i ' m not so sure that you know
that that ' s something that is
that you can really have the knowledge to do as just a lay person
oh not
uh - huh
you know you ' re told if you find them guilty then this is the choices that they have to make it ' s either life or death you know
right
it seems like in some of these cases i don ' t know that you could really have an impartial
juror because of the media given
right
and i don ' t you know in today ' s age of television the coverage like it is there ' s no way that you can be shielded from it
uh - huh
well i know when i ' ve been you know called to jury duty they had to stand up there or stay you know until they dismissed me and i look at the people and the reasons that they get dismissed
before they even you know the selection is even started it is your profession you know nine tenths of them are your professional people
we still have an old texas instruments
professional computer
back in the days when ti was making computers that were similar to in terms of power to the ibm i don ' t remember what those were the ats or something like that or
the same stuff that we always have
yeah do you use computers at work or
well i used to i have a master ' s degree in computer science but i haven ' t i took a time out on careers about
uh - huh
six years ago when my first one turned a year old and
i see
so nowadays i ' m teaching him at home and we ' re using the computer to drill him on math and to let him do some
creative writing without having to have
the mechanics of
handwriting get in the way of his words this way he can
he this way he just has to hunt and peck on the keyboard i have to admit i ' d like a
yeah
a more logical
arrangement of the letters and
what do they call it the cortiope or something
something like that
arrangement
oh
do you use your computer for other things balancing checkbooks do you keep budgets and that sort of thing in it or
we haven ' t for
we ended up
actually just sort of keeping it in the closet for a number of years isn ' t that a terrible statement people who are
we ' re pretty involved with computers in all sorts of other aspects but
i guess i wanted something that was easier to use than this and that was more intuitive and so we just
it just ended up not getting used i should use it to balance my checkbook
but then you have to remember to write it down
that ' s right that ' s right
well mine kind of died so it ' s being worked on right now
or enter it
oh my
where do you find a place to work on a ti
i found a technician who works at ti
uh - huh
and does things like that in his spare time
well that ' s nice to know that there are still such people around
oh yeah
yeah
but i most of the stuff i ' ve used that computer for were work related just bringing work home
yeah well i used to do that i ' d used it until
as i say until i took a hiatus from working i used to
to
trying to think of what you call it i used it essentially as a terminal then
yeah
you know
and
yeah i ' ve done a lot of that
so
and i suspect most people do use them as terminals or
have a spreadsheet and a word processor and that ' s about it
yeah
what else do you need right
well my kids think i should have games
well that ' s probably true
yeah write your own games right
write your own games yeah i just
the computer i work have at work came with windows software and it has a couple of games on it one of which is a solitaire just
oh
just standard card solitaire
yeah
oh really
no who would do something like that
but
yeah we have basically we use the wordstar on it
uh - huh
you know for a bunch of
i ' m taking a class now and
i ' m actually getting a degree in nursing at this point and i asked the
and the class i ' m taking now all of a sudden they want everything typed till now everything ' s been handwritten so it was a good thing that the computer was back up and running hooked the printer up to it
uh - huh
okay
yes
well right now we have one dog inside
uh - huh
she goes out but i mean she ' s an indoor dog
yes
and two outside cats
oh gosh and how long have you had them
male and female
the dog ' s probably about thirteen fourteen years old and the cats are
yes
uh - huh
uh - huh
oh is that right what kind of dog do you have
she ' s a mix of cockapoo cocker spaniel and poodle
white
oh uh - huh i ' ll be darned
uh - huh
oh
yeah
and she ' s slowing down considerably she doesn ' t hear very well and she doesn ' t see very well but she ' s yeah at this age i guess so
uh - huh
well that ' s to be expected at their age
yeah
yeah
i agree yes did you get yours as a pet for your do you have children uh - huh
yeah we have five ah
uh - huh oh well i was wondering if you got your dog originally as a pet for them or just because you ' d had dogs before or
well we have had we had a dog before she was fifteen when she died and this one we bought by accident a farmer called us and wanted us to call the animal shelter to or the dog catcher or somebody to come and get this
my goodness
uh - huh
yeah uh - huh
oh yeah
go get her so that ' s how we got her quite by accident
isn ' t that
yes so that often happens that way well we had intentionally planned to get a dog we had just moved into this house and decided to wait a about a year and then went then we went out then and found one she was in the litter and
uh - huh
uh - huh
uh - huh
she just loved this little dog to pieces but i think she loved her too much because the dog has never been real comfortable with her i think she was always a little bit leery of her
oh
oh
uh - huh
our son on the other hand who was about eleven at the time was not very interested in pets but as it turned out he and this dog have gotten to be really good pals
oh for heaven ' s sake
no but they say it ' s real important for children to have pets because well they can go and talk to them any time they want to and tell them anything they want to and
uh - huh yes
yeah
that ' s right
yeah
and the nursing homes now they ' re finding that it ' s real important to take a pet into a nursing home
yes i have been i have been reading and seeing about that on television uh - huh and how
uh - huh
our one our one nursing home in brooksville has one
uh - huh
is that right
he kind of has free run of the place and there is or somebody takes care of him
isn ' t that amazing
but he goes up and down the halls visiting people and real nice dog and
uh - huh yes it ' s funny how pets can kind of oh take on a certain status in certain areas i mean that made me think of when our daughter was looking at colleges we visited a campus in saint louis and
uh - huh
there were several dogs on the campus and the what was interesting about it was that they were very friendly but they didn ' t appear to belong to anyone and i ' m sure someone you know fed them they were healthy looking dogs
uh - huh
oh really
oh
yeah
but our guide that day said that the one woman many years ago had given a huge sum of money to the university on the condition that there be dogs just kind of left to roam around the campus
is that right
yeah because most campuses don ' t allow pets you know they just do not allow them
i know
yes i know
that ' s kind of great
yeah
yes yeah
uh - huh
so but i this is the only pet we ' ve had you know in all our years of marriage and it ' s been sort of a change for my husband because as a boy growing up
oh uh - huh
well we ' ve had a lot of different pets we had
the kids had rabbits for pets and we also raised them for food at one time
uh - huh
yeah oh yes
and we ' ve had it we ' ve had a skunk for a pet
oh my golly
ah
you can ' t you could never call her and she would come to you had to go chase her down
yeah
i ' ll be darned how interesting
and their eyesight they can ' t see very far either but
uh - huh i guess i ' ve heard that uh - huh
they before we got her everybody said oh they ' re just like a cat you know
uh - huh
isn ' t that interesting that ' s really something how long did you have that
oh my how long
probably seven or eight years
goodness sake
oh my gosh isn ' t that funny
and we ' ve had we ' ve had cats two in the house we had we had two siamese cats
uh - huh
yeah
uh - huh
different times
right
one of them ran off she ran off once or he i guess it was a male he ran off twice and the second time he never came back
my goodness
and we would see him several miles from our house he kind of moved into a woods down there and he got huge down there
uh - huh
i ' ll be
my goodness
he really grew but he never came back
that ' s
that ' s interesting i wouldn ' t picture a siamese as being an outdoor cat
well he wasn ' t a whole lot he was in the house most the time but he did go out sometimes and they it makes a much nicer cat if they ' re outside
uh - huh
yeah
yeah the cats my son has a cat and the vet had told us they get strange if they ' re kept in the house all the time and their cat was not a friendly cat it
uh - huh
well
was not a good
okay what kind of things do you like to do in your spare time
well i have two children so i don ' t have a whole lot of spare time right now one of the things that i ' ve made time for is playing softball
um - hum
uh - huh
i really enjoy i enjoy softball but i enjoy all kind of sports i enjoy watching and participating i really like water sports like swimming and skiing but i don ' t get to do that too often
yeah
and then i really enjoy sewing but i don ' t get much of a chance to just really sit down and do much sewing how about you
oh i like sports type things too we like to get out and walk and we like the water sports too but like you it ' s unless you have a pool in your backyard it ' s kind of hard to get to do that
uh - huh
i know it is do you work full time
very often
part - time
oh
yeah it does i ' ve been
is this going to be your first
yes uh - huh i ' ve been doing some cross - stitch for something i wanted to put in the nursery so i haven ' t done that in years but i ' ve kind of enjoyed that but it ' s just hard to find the time to sit there and do it and
oh
uh - huh
yeah
right well that ' s
right yeah
yeah that ' s neat
yeah i do too
i just go out just to just to enjoy it and not really spend money sometimes just look
yeah
yeah
well since i ' ve had kids it ' s kind of funny i never really was much of a garage sale shopper - til i had kids but you ' ll probably find after your children get bigger
yeah we bought some baby clothes yeah last weekend at a garage sale
yeah oh you can just get all kinds of things and kids especially clothes and toys they just don ' t use them and wear them you know for that many years or anything
yeah
so i ' m i ' ve become a garage sale shopper and it is fun on the weekends i drive around look to see you know who ' s selling what and i found my little daughter some tap shoes for her tap class and
uh - huh
wow yeah
yeah it kind of a hobby it that ' s time consuming too really to find the things you want sometimes you have to stop a lot of places
yeah
right yeah i think that ' s important too i ' m not going to work after the baby comes
yeah well
well that ' s good i ' m glad
yeah well at first when you first have a baby you seems to take every moment of your time partly because you ' re not used to you know juggling your time around like that but
right
eventually the you ' ll be doing lots of stuff so
yes
but i think my husband is real into sports too he plays on a ti softball team and a church softball team and by the time he plays two games a week and i play a game a week we go to lots of softball
but the kids enjoy going because there ' s usually a lot of other kids for them to play with and we that ' s getting outside and you know doing things they like to do too so
yeah and one other thing we ' re doing this year is we bought wet and wild passes
oh
we ' ve never done that before but the kids are always wanting to play in the water and like you said unless you have a pool in your backyard or access to a good place to play it ' s kind of hard
oh wow that ' ll make the summer go by in a hurry keep the kids busy
yeah i think it will yeah because my oldest daughter ' s in school and she gets bored real fast when she ' s home with nothing to do
right
so i think that ' ll be a lot of fun
yeah
so we ' re looking forward to that
yeah
yeah
oh no
yeah
uh - huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah that ' s true
seems like sometimes hobbies do that they kind of take over and turn into work instead of
fun
yeah if it doesn ' t go crite quite right
yeah another thing i enjoy doing is cooking i like especially it ' s real strange but i like to cook for other people like i have a friend that ' s pregnant but she can ' t get up and walk around right now
oh no
so i enjoy you know cooking things to take over to her house or
oh that ' s nice
yeah
oh yeah
yeah when you ' re home it ' s it makes a difference it sure does
yeah
well do you guys go camping or anything like that
yeah we ' ve done a little bit of camping we like that it ' s there again it ' s just so hard to find time to get away for a whole weekend
um - hum
yeah
well that ' s something we ' re plan on doing not this weekend but the next my parents go camping a lot
and they invited the kids and my husband and me to go with them and
oh that sounds fun
yeah we ' re really looking forward to it the girls love it they ' ve been a couple of times and just getting to be outside you know all the time and sleep in a tent and that ' s really fun to them so
yeah
we ' re looking forward to that
well that sounds nice i think that ' ll be a good family thing
yeah i think so
to start doing more often if
uh - huh
yeah we ' ve camped with some friends who have young children and if you can find some place where those little sunfish are right around the shore where they can just pull in a lot
uh - huh
uh - huh
oh they have so much fun doing that and they think they ' re really great fishermen because they ' re catching so many
yeah
yeah
oh i know yeah she ' s really looking forward i ' m hoping that ' s another thing though when sometimes your
hobbies can interfere with each other because my husband ' s afraid he ' s going to have a softball tournament that weekend and i ' m saying no yeah if you ' re doing a lot of things sometimes you have conflicts and you have to decide what you enjoy the most so
right yeah do you do any other crafts or anything besides just sewing
it ' s not too hard it ' s i don ' t think it ' s as hard as like knitting or crochet or something like that
yeah
yeah
yeah i crocheted when i was younger it ' s funny when i was in high school i made a blanket and
yeah i started to knit a sweater and i got off on my rows somehow and so what should have been the back all of a sudden was on the front and then i tore it out and threw it down and i never have
but
uh - huh
oh yeah
yeah well i did the same thing when i was pregnant with my first daughter i was really bored and i bought one of those latch hook rug kits
oh uh - huh
oh it was a real pretty rug and i thought well i could use this as a gift or something you know and oh it was so it ' s beautiful but i did not realize how long it took and i got about two thirds of it done
but for a while there latch hook rugs were a real big hobby it seemed like people did them a lot people don ' t do that much anymore so it was something easy i could do
yeah i remember that yeah
yeah they are pretty easy
yeah
well it ' s been real good talking to you and i hope you enjoy your camping trip
yeah you too
oh go ahead i am glad to talk to an expert i always wanted to know who an expert was
oh well i ' m not an expert i just had a little i ' ve seen a little pollution in my time it ' s
that ' s really a pollution issue i think pollution issue is
is the argument over people catching things like respiratory disease
well there there ' s two things
the one i ' m interested the most i guess myself
would be the freons i mean for air the one i guess that ' s the one i ' m most curious about is how they ' re going to replace the freons in air - conditioning
that seemed to be the biggest surprise to me and whether when they replace it you know they ' re going to really come up with something that is not just as bad
yeah i was you know where they were all concerned about that but that it seems to be
well did you see carl sagan on sixty minutes on when he was talking about when if the if the war started in kuwait and they ' d set those all
no i heard about it though
it was it was it was interesting but i ' m just curious what he has to say now that they ' ve got them all lit
was that before i didn ' t see it was that before they actually did that or it was
yes and his argument was that you would see a year with no summer
which actually happened it yes it actually happened
because of that you know
anyway research people and they said that the that the pollution would not go high enough
and it ' s going to be interesting to see if carl sagan and his billions and billions of stars may have once made a mistake but
right
are you don ' t work at ti
yeah i do
oh okay
but i ' m i do that in my formalize
where do you work in research or
no i ' m a planner a production planner
oh okay
but i i ' m in the active reserves as a weatherman so
no okay yeah
i keep up from time to time but what the argument is that maybe there isn ' t global warming and maybe there is
but if there is
we probably could do something about it now and if there isn ' t if there isn ' t and we do some the right things i think how do you feel about all this smog and stuff on cars
yeah
well i ' m kind of a car buff myself i was going to ask you another question but
i ' ll do that in a minute i think that the changing you know from leaded fuel was a tremendous advantage
well do you have an older car
you know not using
no
really oh i ' m a car buff too we ought to work talk about that one day
i think you can use the you can use high you know the ninety two percent ninety two octane i don ' t think you ' ll have any trouble
i ' m not having any problem it ' s a seventy
oh yeah
and
no i think i work on my own cars and
i don ' t think that ' s a problem i thought i ' m saying i was glad to get rid of leaded gasoline
but did you have another you said you had another question
oh the same thing about the war or related to the war on i was watching cnn and i cannot remember what station it was
what did you see the advertisements
when they talked about nuclear war what that would have been like in changing the atmosphere it is so scary that
i hope that every one of the government officials saw that because it was just total disaster you know
did you see any of those i it was
yeah
no i didn ' t see that i know that the that ' s
it must have been channel thirteen i don ' t recall although i thought it was on cnn oh i
well that they talked nuclear winner and i suppose that ' s the ultimate pollution problem
it was a somewhat of a commercial because it i saw it regularly
and it showed that and it was really devastating and it would
well
how much ash would fall and how it would essentially literally destroy the world you know
well it ' s interesting that the chernobyl accident actually because the circulation budget as high as it went
covered
a fairly remarkable amount they did some tracers and they i think it ' s drawn in i think
gets in there because i can ' t think of the other trace but i saw a presentation on that and they it went quite a long ways but i guess
i can be a little sympathetic but you know there ' s some argument that in the blue grass of kentucky that the smoky mountains
that that ' s the pine trees giving off pollution and
oh really yeah there there ' s probably a lot of natural things
but the but when you see when you get up in the morning in dallas and see all that haze from west texas is that is that pollution
yeah
it i guess it ' s got to be really i don ' t know i don ' t know if it ' s air pollution it ' s dust pollution whether it ' s natural or not i don ' t know
well it that ' s the thing is that i think i think dallas really does have a problem in this the idea if we could get some cleaner fuel
burning fuel the problem is it ' s like los angeles people don ' t people don ' t want to use mass transit so
yeah oh yeah well i live in arlington and there are no buses i mean there is the only school bus the only buses you see are school buses so
but who wants to who wants to ride a bus
well i know it it ' s you know the car is we have this big romance with the car but i think people are would be interested if you had one i mean
well my boss drives forty miles one way each day
yeah
and one of the guys that works with me drives forty five miles
yeah
and they don ' t think it well i guess they do think something of it but
not enough to
you know you consider how much
but then you get into all these issues of whether it it ' s the types of pollution and what it ' s doing to your lungs and are we going to die of respiratory so we all move out of the
yeah
out of downtown so we get away from the smog my wife grew up in southern california and they moved out to the valley
before los angeles when the valley was clean
yeah
and now the valley is not and so people move out one more valley and
well you said you were car buff i think that all of us could use one electric car right now i mean today because i think
yes
you said people drive forty miles and fifty whatever yeah when you go to trips and all you can have one gasoline car but i think we all could in a family say
have an electric car where my one of my daughters or my wife my wife she could use one now if they had one you know
well do you know
because they she don ' t even she doesn ' t put fifty miles a day on the car
general motors apparently has one that they ' re testing i think it ' s
no it ' s alcohol vehicles that they ' re testing almost
no you ' re right i have seen them but they have a battery car
but they
i went to the auto show this past week and they did not endorse now that i think of it
suppose
and i was so interested in the auto show i didn ' t think to ask anybody there were no electric cars i was surprised but now that you just mentioned that
huh well the road and track was talking about that this apparently general motors has some they apparently think they ' re close
yeah i think there could be a lot of i people close this is really we ' re
were nine years away or less i guess from the next century and i think
well there ' s still a lot of research i was over in the research lab a couple i guess it ' s been about a month ago and saw this
there have been research it was a little light that says solar powered research
yeah they ' ve got a they ' ve got a area over in the se building too which is but it ' s a solar
it ' s for they got some money from a power company and it ' s probably more generating power for you know electricity a hundred and twenty volt or whatever
yeah well do you work in that c building
no i ' m actually in the south building but
oh well i ' m at
i was i ' m the facility so i ' ve been in all most of the buildings anyway
oh well i ' m in i ' m in the c building been there for all my life
oh yeah well the solar area is right
right around from the auditorium now
and they they ' ve got several different areas where they ' re called solar lab
huh
it ' s right there on the first floor you ought to walk by there
yeah but the solar project you know ti ' s been into it for years and i guess it ' s just not economical yet because of the other fuels
well the problem is that gas at a dollar a gallon
you know
yeah
i ' ve seen some i think then again i ' m surprised now i didn ' t think they ' d asked anybody when i was in the auto show
air pollution or companies or anyone there it was just pure automobiles
well i thought i saw an ad for volkswagen that had an alcohol
there
they had one with spots on it and something i didn ' t go but it was showing they i mean
hum
i didn ' t see did you go
an article
no i didn ' t i didn ' t go so i wish
oh
i was quite impressed with all the cars you know the engines are so much smaller now and everything and they ' re they all have brand new engines even general motors
very few only the caprice and them and the cadillac had eight the old v8s they ' re all brand new engines of course they ' re burning gasoline of course
they ' ve done a lot
now and
whether you know that ' s one way you know
on air pollution i don ' t know if the automobiles are the biggest contributor or not really they ' ve got catalytic converters everyone seem to have
gone to that whether they last and do a good job and now that they
the inspection systems are analyzing that well what do you think if you ' re in that you know if you ' re concerned about that i mean if you ' re knowledgeable on that
well there
there you go okay
now i ' m sorry excuse me
and i do that we recycle newspapers we take you know the dallas morning news daily and the plano paper daily and you know after a month of that you got a ton of newspapers
right
oh i know it builds up really fast
it really does i do recycle newspapers and glass
uh - huh
we don ' t really have enough plastic to mess with we don ' t you know like we don ' t drink milk and we don ' t have children so we don ' t have you know six thousand plastic milk jugs a month you know
yeah we do we have two a two year old and a three year old and so it really builds up with us
yeah
right
but there is you know there is a place you can take those also you know at the same place just put them in a different container
yeah
and plano has plans i believe it ' s tentatively scheduled for sometime in may of this year the city is going to leave receptacles at people ' s home and they
oh yeah that would be much more convenient yeah
it certainly would and they can separate it and then the you know trash guys will pick it up
yeah
which would really be handy you know for people like shut ins or people who can ' t or don ' t drive you know they can ' t get to the these centers
yeah
or it just builds up so often yeah
and i ' m sure rather than try to ask someone to take them for them they probably just pitch them you know
yeah
but i think that ' s probably a good idea
they used to have several places that were a little ways out in the community that did the paper and all and they stopped doing it because they said it wasn ' t profitable
uh - huh
right
so finally they the people put so much pressure on the city they did a survey of everybody and they took a big huge bin that has paper and plastic
uh - huh
uh - huh
and put it in front of the wal - mart store in town and they it just really every time you went by there it was just over flowing
uh - huh
that ' s right
and so wal - mart complained
uh - huh yes
so they moved it behind the store and nobody knew where it was and so people kept piling stuff in the same place where it used to be
yeah
great
oh it was just like a dump there and so finally you know i called and they said you know it was behind there and i started taking my things behind there
i bet it was
uh - huh
so we do that with because we have milk cartons you know constantly with two little kids and the paper but it just builds up it would be so nice if they had it
uh - huh
sure
you know at your home where you could just turn it in so they final had enough of a response that they decided to try a small target area
uh - huh
uh - huh
in one neighborhood and they have pickup there it ' s i think once or twice a week
right
uh - huh
and the first couple weeks they did it nobody got their stuff out so they had not much participation and they were going to cancel it but then finally people started getting the message
yeah it ' s just a matter of education i think
yeah and i think that you know if they can get enough going
uh - huh
they ' ll continue it you know throughout the rest of the city but it ' s not i think originally people thought it would be profitable for cities to do this and it ' s not going to be i don ' t think
uh - huh
yeah that ' s right
i think basically it ' s a good idea you know i hope it works
yeah i do to because it ' s amazing how much you know trash we can generate i know this year we took our christmas tree they had a place in the park where you could go have your tree shredded and they gave you a little
absolutely
right
uh - huh right
mulch home with you know and take buckets of that home so that was really good idea i thought
uh - huh
sure absolutely
and there ' s just you know the two of us my wife and i and it ' s amazing how much stuff just the two of us generate you know i can imagine a family of you know four or five
yeah
oh yeah it ' s really it adds up so fast yeah
it really does
as far as new stuff to recycle you know i don ' t really i don ' t really know i really hadn ' t thought about it to tell you the truth
yeah well they ' re working on diapers which would be great i ' ve read so many different things about diapers and now their saying that originally they thought the disposables were just awful
that ' s right i was uh - huh
uh - huh
but now their saying that they ' re there really not that much in comparison to the others because you don ' t have to use the water to wash them and you know all different kinds of things too so
that ' s right
the diaper service trucks apparently the fuel that they use and the fumes that they produce to deliver and drop those off
uh - huh
yeah
so i don ' t know what ' s the you know right thing to do but i really would hope that they would come up i know there was a brand just briefly on the market that was recyclable but the landfill have to do something special you know for those
i see
but that just generates a tremendous of volume of trash too so
yeah
yeah
it does and you just feel guilty if you don ' t do something with them you know because you hate to contribute to the problem but on the on the other hand the alternatives aren ' t to great either
that ' s right that ' s right
absolutely
that ' s right absolutely
yeah i don ' t know what else they could recycle more of i guess we don ' t really use that many tin cans i guess there ' s some places where you can recycle aluminum but i don ' t know about like cans that you keep vegetables and stuff in i don ' t know if those are recyclable or
uh - huh
i think they ' re made out of aluminum
yes there are there is a receptacle you know at the centers also for aluminum but again we don ' t we don ' t generate that much so we don ' t
yeah
yeah we don ' t either
yeah
we usually use frozen vegetables and things so we don ' t really have much of that but
that ' s right
that ninety nine percent of ours is newspaper and you know glass
yeah well now when we lived out in california they actually had places where you could recycle if you change the oil in your car
uh - huh
or for aerosol cans and things like that because they say it ' s not safe to put those things in the regular trash
uh - huh
that ' s right
car batteries
yeah
uh - huh
i don ' t you know i don ' t change my own oil so i don ' t i don ' t have that problem
yeah
well other than that i ' m not really sure we try to recycle old clothes
yeah
uh - huh yeah well we do to as a matter of fact
our church has a place where you can take them and they you know pass them on to other families so
right
yeah
yes we have one of those in town uh - huh
yeah
you know our church each year has a one of their major fund raisers is you know a garage sale and there ' s a ton of clothes always you know left over and i take those down to the
oh
it ' s called the clothes closet that ' s what it ' s called here in plano right uh - huh and they distribute them to the people that need them
uh - huh kind of like a goodwill kind of place yeah
yeah
yeah that ' s real helpful too
uh - huh yeah
yeah
no i really can ' t either
okay
okay well it was nice talking to you
you to take care bye - bye
oh really
yeah well i was surprised that they had their people their own people in the survey but then why not
well i didn ' t realize that i thought all of it was ti employees in the survey i didn ' t i was the other way around i didn ' t realize there were outside people in the survey so
oh i see
do you know what they ' re doing with all this when they ' re finished
i am not positive i probably have gotten about the same information you have because i don ' t work anywhere even near that division i ' m in even in a completely different site so
um - hum
i know that once they get through with this i i ' ve read where they ' re they may call certain people back for like the second phase or something i ' m but i ' m not really sure i mean i know you know why they ' re gathering the information right
no i don ' t
oh you don ' t what they ' re what they ' re working on is the way i understand it is the computer system
that you know in the future and who knows how far in the future they believe that computers will be able to understand human voice where instead of having to have a keyboard and press in what you want the computer to do
oh i see
you ' ll be able to tell it what you want it to do and that ' s why they ' re gathering the voices in order to do research to enable computers to be able to do that
in other words they want to know if our voice can direct a machine
right that ' s exactly right
well gosh i couldn ' t direct children i doubt that i can direct a machine are you in dallas then
direct a machine huh
i ' m in lewisville which is just north of dallas just about thirty minutes north of dallas yeah so
north of dallas
yeah we just came home from an expensive trip west and drove through the dallas fort worth area without stopping for any reason whatsoever and i
did you
we ' re our town is five thousand so i was very concerned about what the trip the traffic would be like around dallas fort worth and gosh we were through there before we even realized that we were in heavy traffic so you ' ve got a good system
sure
yeah
yeah we really do we really do unless you ' re doing it
there is there is it ' s that way anywhere you go
shall we get on to nursing homes
yeah that ' s fine go ahead
okay
my mother is seventy will be seventy nine years old this fall and has been a nursing home resident for nearly three years
oh my goodness
oh really
so i feel like i have
my decision was not i did not make the decision to send her to a nursing home she made the decision that she could not any longer live in
in her apartment by herself she had long since given up her home and gone into an apartment and of course that was her decision at the time too so
uh - huh
and then in that we are in a small royal a rural community i think that makes such a difference too because
well as a matter of fact my daughter is now the assistant director of nurses at that nursing home
oh wow how wonderful
yes she wasn ' t at the time
uh - huh
but she has since gone to that nursing home so i just feel that i did not have any of the trauma that people talk about
you sound like you ' ve gotten very lucky you really have
well it just did a really marvelous thing and mother ' s mind is good it ' s her body that ' s bad and
yeah
good
uh - huh
to have the responsibility of putting someone in a nursing home whose mind was not good and could not tell you if they were being mistreated or something it just would all be so different
uh - huh
yeah oh definitely we kind of went through a situation with my father my father was a he was pronounced a diabetic when he was thirty and had diabetes for all you know many years and
hum
you know didn ' t take quite as good care of himself in the beginning as he should have i mean he was put on insulin immediately but his diet he wasn ' t as careful with as he should have been in the beginning so he deteriorated rather quickly and
hum
by the time he was in his mid fifties which is very young he was he was nearly blind and was going into kidney failure and couldn ' t
um - hum
couldn ' t walk for very long periods of time the muscles in his neck and that type of thing had deteriorated to the point that he always had to have something to lean his head back against and you know we were you know myself and my two sisters were
you know in the situation of a fifty seven year old father looking in to put him in a nursing home which was which was at i ' m know it it ' s scary isn ' t it yeah i mean it was
i ' m fifty seven
right
it was just a horrible situation for us to you know to be in and we just you know because of course like you say like your mother his mind was perfect and wonderful it was he just could not get around to take care of himself
and we ended up opting for a live - in nurse and you know that came into his home and we set her up a room in a spare room and she stayed there with him instead because we just could not imagine
a fifty seven year old man in a nursing home we just you know we just could not could not imagine doing it
and we knew that it wouldn ' t you know we couldn ' t even do the live - in nurse thing forever you know and but he was just so against and when you said your mother knew that this is probably where she needed to be it was such a different story because he was
um - hum
so against going to a nursing home which at that age i can ' t blame him you know it would just it just scared him to death to be you know that young and who knows you know the thought of being there another twenty or thirty years you know just was just
um - hum
um - hum
yeah
too much for him you know so we you know we opted for that route so i kind of know what you mean about the trauma of you know the thought of doing it you know it was just
um - hum
it was just very hard but i guess you know there ' s good ones and there ' s bad ones i think you just have to be so very careful you know and
um - hum
you know you ' re lucky if you do have a situation where the mind is still good and they can tell you if they ' re being well taken care of i think otherwise you end up with serious problems
in our locality we have a lot of government services like the home health care and etcetera which i ' m sure they do in cities too
you know
uh - huh
um - hum
but we do not have the staff to draw from to find someone who could stay for day in and day out with we just don ' t have those people
uh - huh
they just are not available even though you would like to make that choice
uh - huh
well you know
that was another situation because my this was my father lived in missouri and was in a little small town of about three thousand and we just got very lucky and found a woman
um - hum
yeah
and we just got extremely lucky to find someone who was willing to do it and she stayed five days a week and spent the night
but did go home on weekends and then we found another girl who had been kind of coming in and helping dad clean and do that kind of thing for several years who said that she was willing to stay on the weekends and help him
um - hum
hum
hum
hum
how long
how long were you able to maintain that
well we only we only did that for i guess that went on for about all not quite six months he passed away after six months there at home which
oh uh - huh
we were very thankful that we were able to keep him at home and that you know he did pass away at home and rather than being in a nursing home i know he was much happier spending that six months at home
yeah
yeah
oh
um - hum
um - hum your mother was not living or
you know definitely so
they were they had been divorced many years earlier yeah so he was he was alone and really had you know and
yeah
yeah
and my youngest sister was about an hour and a half away in college and i was you know down here six hundred miles away and then my the third sister was in atlanta georgia you know so we weren ' t really
yeah
well we were even right there where we could take care of him you know so it was really a hard situation you know when in this society where everybody kind of gets spread out it ' s not as easy as it used to be to take care of aging parents you know it you know
um - hum
um - hum
it ' s hard to move them in with you or you move in with them or even you know drop in everyday you know you just
i just never considered the moving in with i could not ever have handled that my mother is incontinent and i don ' t know i suppose that would have been my excuse
yeah
uh - huh
but i don ' t think had that situation not existed that i could have done that at all i ' m not
that ' s a that ' s a real trying experience to try to you know to move back in and live harmoniously together after all those years it ' s
i
um - hum
um - hum
well i think my sister is an rn and lives in knoxville tennessee and i think that my mother had thought in the back of her mind that she perhaps might go to jean ' s and it did take when she first went into the care center
uh - huh
she just completely gave up just could not even sit up in the wheelchair without being tied in
uh - huh
and that went on for almost six months and finally my sister came to visit and mother was talking about getting better and getting out of the care center
oh
and my sister is very blunt and she said mother this is going to be your home you might as well get used to it which i could not say to her
and from that point on i think within the next six months she came to accept that as fact and then she began improving and is walking better now than she probably did in three years but
uh - huh
wonderful
oh that ' s wonderful
still for the most part she is wheelchair bound or bed bound and
um - hum
i don ' t know i guess maybe i have accepted that the nursing home is her home because i ' ve started to decorate her room more than i ever did in the beginning so
uh - huh
even though everyone knows that ' s the way it has to be you still it takes a little bit to accept
no and certainly it ' s very expensive there ' s no question about that
doesn ' t make it easy no
oh
so what kind of animals do you have
well i have two cats
i have two cats because i can ' t have dogs where i live i i ' ve wanted a dog i owned a we had dogs when i was growing up all the time
uh - huh
and you know our cats are very interesting and we never owned cats when i was growing up so this is a
it ' s been a really neat kind of learning experience for me they ' ve blown all my preconceptions about cats
so do you do you have pets
yeah i have a dog and a cat
uh - oh do they get along
uh - huh
oh did the dog the dog like know that there was a cat and
well it was very it was interesting because it it ' s just you know part of their makeup they ' re psyche i mean they just hate each other automatically but after a while they got to be good friends and
hum
yeah
yeah that ' s actually why we got our second cat i we thought our cat needed a pet
uh - huh
you know you tend to personify these things but our cat thinks our oldest cat thinks that it should be a person and our youngest cat actually thinks it ' s a cat
so it works out pretty well
yeah
well i ' ll tell you one thing i found with pets i think cats
are easier to take care of especially when on a situation like you go off on a trip you know it ' s a real pain with a dog because you have to have someone come over and walk them and let them out and that kind of thing
uh - huh
yeah
feed them and all that
yeah you know an interesting story is i have a friend who has a cat that actually knows how to open tender vittles bags
so if they go on a trip they just leave the bags on the kitchen floor and the cat ' ll go and open one when it wants to eat
oh that ' s amazing
i ' m i swear to god it ' s like you know the i guess it earlier time it would have to figure out how to use a can opener but you know now it it ' s pretty self sufficient i just think
they say you own a dog and you feed a cat and i think that that ' s pretty much pretty much true
yeah
that is interesting i hadn ' t ever heard anything like that but
yeah i it blew me away
yeah we ' ve been we ' ve been pretty lucky too the reason we first got the dog to begin with was i lived i ' m in school still and i lived closer to campus
um - hum
and as usual the neighborhoods right near campus aren ' t that nice
uh - huh
oh really
we usually had rifle cleaning parties on the front porch when you know you move into a bad neighborhood you have your have all your friends over play the grateful dead and clean your rifles and they pretty much get the idea
but the dog i guess would work too
yeah
well it is a big dog
oh okay
well she ' s not pure and
we tried to figure out what she was crossed with we know the mother was a shepherd but she looks like she ' s crossed with like greyhound because she is just thin as a rail and
oh
wow well see they say that the mixed breeds have a better temperament anyway all that inbreeding that they do that they have to do to maintain a pure blood line i guess makes them really weird
my sister has a pure bred gold yellow lab and that dog has every problem you could imagine you know it ' s allergic to fleas it ' s got another skin condition and just
the dreaded hip dysplasia
so we haven ' t really had much problems with her she ' s just extremely hyper and i guess that accounts for her physique and she runs like a gazelle so
um - hum
it ' s fun to take her to the park and watch her run rings around all the other dogs
trying to play with them and they look at her like you ' re crazy you think i ' m going to catch you
she ' s
maybe she is part greyhound huh
okay where have you been on vacation lately
well the last vacation i went was to cozumel and that was last march and april
oh yeah
have you got another one planned
not at this point
although if we take another vacation i think we might like to go to cancun this time have you been there
but also since my in - laws just moved to utah we ' re kind of pressured to go up there and go snow skiing and i ' ve never been snow skiing so i ' m not really into that i would rather do the beach scene
i agree i mean if i ' m going to go on vacation i want to lay out in the sun and relax
yeah
and someplace i ' d like to go is like to the other side of the caribbean as you know as opposed to the mexican side i want drink rum drinks and
oh really
lay on those beaches over there
like in the in the virgin islands
that sounds good another place that i heard is really pretty is the cayman islands
oh yeah
although i hear they ' re expensive
yeah that ' s definitely true well i got a magazine the other day called caribbean life and it had
different charter boats in there where like three couples could charter a boat and have a crew and everything but
you just pretty much go wherever you want to go and they had great summer rates so like if you do it before september or october or something like that you really save a ton of money and i would love to do that
well our tenth anniversary is coming up in october uh - huh yeah and
oh really i didn ' t know that
i ' d like to you even if we just get away for three or four days i think it would be kind of neat
yeah
just to do something originally a couple years ago we were hoping to do a trip to greece
but i don ' t think that ' s going to be possible now
that ' d be fun
now that is probably the number one place on earth that i would like to go um - hum
really
wow well all the pictures i ' ve ever seen of it has just been gorgeous but i don ' t know i think i think i ' d
there ' s other places that i would rather go first i think maybe
like where
australia and down in there i mean the pictures i ' ve seen of that even
oh i can ' t even think of the island now but she told us just wonderful stories of the island and the pictures she showed us and all that i can ' t think of the place now it ' s a pretty big one oh venezuela
well i wherever she wherever she was she was out you know on the edge but anyway she had some great pictures and i always thought that would be fun to go there and they have great beaches too
well the main place that nick would like to go is rio
yeah
oh really yeah
um - hum he ' s been talking about that for years
hey that would be fun yeah when i was little i always heard how romantic rio was but i would like to go to tahiti too that ' d be fun
but even just like in the states it was fun when we went to mackinac island that was pretty cool
that ' s up in michigan yeah we talked about doing one of those drive around trips you know you drive around
yeah
i guess lake michigan and then you take the ferry over to the other side and um - hum
oh really
huh
but i ' d only want to do that in the summer
yeah because it i was there at the end of july and it was still pretty cool
so yeah i ' m not a cold weather person at all
no neither am i
well i think that once we get the house refinanced we ' re going to probably try to take our free tickets and either go to cancun or
do the little trip to southern california and then on up to utah
so i don ' t know we ' ll see
well nick just got back from san diego last night and he said it was absolutely gorgeous and i haven ' t been there since i guess it was seventy three
oh really
and i ' d love to go back that was just one of the prettiest places on earth i have ever seen
yeah i think i ' m going to work in a business trip and go to san diego
how do you work in a business trip
well since you already set up the office out in southern california there ' s nothing left for me
well that ' s true hadn ' t thought about that
and it doesn ' t appear we ' re going to be opening any new offices
well they could get really big though and hire a secretary and then you could have to go train
that ' d be all right
yeah tell them to do that
yes
but i mean a trip is a trip
that ' s right i ' ll go anywhere
so
oh i would too in a drop of a hat fortunately we aren ' t tied down with any other little two legged responsibilities we can go
um - hum
you can do that yeah
yeah makes a big difference
as a matter of fact i was offered a free ticket air ticket today if i want one
well take it
well
eventually i might but archie offered me a ticket um - hum
oh really
well good
and i thought we ' d you know i wouldn ' t want to just take it but he has american and a couple of other ones and he said they just go to waste
uh - huh
and i nick ' s going to new orleans in january i think next year i haven ' t been there for so long
ooh i love new orleans
oh yeah
such good food
yeah or watch the people or the hookers go up and down the street
oh god yeah that ' s the first time i ever saw an actual transvestite i think was in new orleans
oh i saw them in
san diego i went to a shore a show you know one of those transvestite shows
really
oh yeah
that was something
well i guess i ' ll go take my shower i ' ve been working out so i ' ll do that
okay
well i ' ll talk to you later
okay now do you push the buttons now
no we just hang up
i do at times off and on right now i ' m probably in one of the more the more off times
any particular reason that you get off of it or does it seem to work for you
oh it works fine it ' s just i think sometimes i you know you get busy you slack off a little bit and then
you know there ' s no more i mean you know then it ' s work to catch up
yeah
you know then the two or three times where i ' ve got to the point i really needed one i created one and stuck by it
and you do stick by it when you do it huh
yes how about you
well i tend to have a monthly budget and basically what it is i list all my income coming in and the expenses and whatever ' s left over i spend
hm
that just kind of seems to be the way it works
the budget i stuck on the most
pardon me
was the budget i was on the most was what was called the ten twenty seventy budget
and
and basically ten percent of your income goes to
long - term savings
um - hum
twenty percent goes toward
basically short - term you know doing going out to dinner
like going to the movies maybe you know saving that part up toward like going on you know something a little more short - term than like the long - term budget
and then the and then seventy percent goes toward you know paying debts and that kind of stuff with the whole idea being that you pay yourself first you ' re more likely to stick with it
yes and i know that theory unfortunately neither i ' m married and neither my husband or myself have the greatest amount of self - control in the world
hm
and so that makes it pretty easy not to stick with the budget at times you know instead of thinking oh we ' ll save it this month we ' ll think well oh gee we ' ll buy this lamp or this whatever you know
sure
so our savings plan sometimes goes down the drain
but are you married
i will be a week from next monday
oh do you think this is going to change the way you budget your money in any way
no not really
have you kind of discussed this already with your fiancee
yeah so far for now i think i mean for now we ' ve still got our own money really
and that ' ll probably it ' ll probably be that way till you know we like buy our own house together or something
uh - huh
in which case you know it ' s very convenient to once again throw everything together
well i agree it ' s
maybe for us anyway it ' s easier just to put it all in one big pot and not worry about who makes what or who you know who donates what to it
right
but we just kind of started out that way and
yeah and right now in my case it ' s more situation that she
has still got a lot of debt
and it ' s easier for me to kind of like just shoulder
oh
the normal stuff
uh - huh
and let her concentrate on getting herself out of debt
well that ' s a good idea do you think this is true of all women i seem to have been in debt when my husband and i got married too
well i was the year before and that was the last time i really got on a budget was to really fight being in debt because i didn ' t like it
no it ' s not a whole lot of fun
so
i think it ' s people in general
yeah you have a that ' s a tendency to do it when you can
one of the ways i insure my long - term savings is the fact that you know i ' ve got a 401k plan so i ' ve got
five percent of my income going into that that ' s actually five percent before taxes
um - hum
um - hum
that you know so that ' s even more and then i ' ve also
you know got a few other miscellaneous automatic deductions
which i think is really the easiest way to save because once you have the money in your hand in the check you ' ll think oh well i just won ' t put anything
yeah
or you know even if it ' s of course most of us are direct deposit anymore anyway i ' m sure but once it goes into the checking account it ' s awfully hard to transfer it over
right well i ' ve even got a fifty dollar a month mutual fund automatic transfer on the twentieth of every month
that ' s a good idea
you know once again you know you know it ' s there you know it ' s going to happen
it ' s a
an easier way to
to save
um - hum
and your fiancee she ' ll she goes along with the savings part too even though she ' s managed to get herself into debt
well sure you know you know like you said for right now we really kind of each have our own money which is maybe a weird way to do your budgeting but
um - hum
well actually i know some people a girlfriend of mine who was married probably about three or four years ago and they still have separate checking accounts that ' s the way they prefer it
okay what do you think about it
well the roles have definitely changed in the last generation or so
oh yeah
i think a lot of it has to do with women working
uh - huh yeah i do too i think it ' s going to in like in the future i think all women are going to work i mean they may let you off for a day or two to have your baby
yeah
yeah
but that will be it or either they ' ll have a computer at home and in the hospital where you can just you know just continue right on with your work i mean it really is coming to that because most women
now days cannot afford the time that they could take off unless the company pays them they can ' t even afford to take off you know to have children it seems like
right
and it and it seems if you ' re going to have kids that you are
yeah
and because if you have you know two well if you go to work you ' re just working to pay for day care two or three you know
right
now i was real lucky because my husband had a good enough job where when my kids were you know when i had them and when they were small
uh - huh
until they got in junior high school my youngest one got in junior high i didn ' t have to work i mean i didn ' t work i needed to but i didn ' t
oh that is good
yeah steve ' s steve has a sister who has four she just had her fourth one in march and she doesn ' t have to work either i don ' t know how they do it
i don ' t know how people do it with one you know obviously
yeah obviously we don ' t have any and i don ' t i think that ' s part of the role reversal is it ' s okay to get married
and not have kids and i think for society for such a long time said well you know you ' re married now you need to have your family and i don ' t think it ' s been until recently that they had decided that two people was a family
oh yeah
right well it ' s getting where you can ' t hardly afford if you ' re going to give your kids any kind of education and stuff you can ' t hardly afford to have over two
you know and
right
and i mean it ' s hard with two now we my youngest one i have two i have a son and a daughter and my youngest one is going to be graduating from college soon but if i had a third one
oh
yeah
i just don ' t know where it would come from
yeah
because i work now i work full time and you know it when you put them through college it just takes just about everything you got
yeah
they get loans and grants and scholarships and stuff like that helps out but still it cost a lot
oh yeah i mean just the you know the cost of living and loans don ' t pay for groceries and
right
stuff
and cars and all their books and the books are outrageous
oh i know i know
i mean absolutely outrageous and they ' re getting worse
my daughter brought home a book the other day
that she was going to have to have for her one of her next classes and it was like ninety six dollars and this book is a little bitty skinny book i said my goodness what is it lined in gold you know but it is it ' s getting worse and
jeez
yeah
yeah
if i ' d of probably had three or four children i don ' t see how we could have made it you know without me working
but that ' s probably because you know if you had three you know would say if i ' d of had four i guess it ' s always not being able to picture one more but in essence you probably would have worked out fine
right but i think i would have had to work if i ' d of had that many i ' d of had to work in order for my kids to you know even though he brings in a real good living and everything in order for me to keep up i would have had to work
yeah
yeah
but i think it ' s getting more and more like when you have one child now that ' s it you know then you go to work and you work because
yeah
yeah and that ' s all right with me because i don ' t want to stay home you know i think i ' m just part of the new stuff that is just
yeah
i don ' t know i think i would just go nuts sitting at home all day long
well you know i can ' t imagine how i did because now i work all the time and well i work all week and i can ' t imagine how i stayed home you know i think to myself what did i do
yeah
yeah
and i think it just it revolutionized an where a woman thinks that a way you know just like now my daughter
somebody that you want to spend the rest of your life with but i mean it is so far down the road where now when i graduated high school the thing uh - huh and then you got married and then you had a family
right
that ' s you did that ' s what you did
i mean that ' s just the way it was you know and that ' s like when my i know when my mother ' s age it was
yeah
always the kids and the family and everything had to come first and the woman stayed home and took care of them an
yeah
yeah
i like the way it is it ' s being see we ' re from houston and so it ' s not so hard
yeah
for people you know you ' ve been married three or so years and you don ' t have kids well it ' s okay nobody does but you come to a place like belton
and a lot of the kids here get married out of high school it ' s real small town
uh - huh
and it ' s and a lot of people in our we ' re the only couple in our sunday school class except for one other couple who are in their forties and they can ' t have children who don ' t have children and they can ' t imagine why we would want to have children and i ' m going well you know
there ' s more to life you know there ' s life in there that ' s you know not everybody has to have kids and i ' d rather spend the time with my husband than you know spending time here it ' s your turn you know
right
yeah but you know that now even whenever i was coming up and everything and
we got married right out of high school well a year after i got out of high school and i didn ' t have kids for four and a half years
uh - huh
but that was because i wanted to work and i wasn ' t ready for kids and everybody thought oh my gosh what is the matter with her you know
yeah i think that ' s what it is i ' m not either
they ' re probably going oh i bet she can ' t get pregnant
right i mean they thought that it was terrible you know and then when i ' d tell them you know well i ' m just not ready for children yet oh but that you know you better you better just get ready now well you don ' t just get ready
yeah
but i was kind of odd because as a general rule the people that married during my time they had kids within a year and i just was not ready for kids i wanted to get out and work a little bit and
yeah
i wanted to travel and stuff like that which we did and kids didn ' t fit in right then but it ' s getting more and more like that where there ' s more and more couples and really
if you don ' t want the kids then it ' s not the time to have it i don ' t care what anybody tells you and i think that more and more the attitude ' s getting that a way
uh - huh right
because that ' s like my daughter now she says that you know maybe when she ' s thirty she might want a child then
yeah
and even though i ' d like to have grandchildren i can see her point
yeah steve ' s mom finally
finally you know said that god will take care of us when it ' s our time
right
she finally admitted you know she finally told me it ' s okay if you don ' t but it took every nerve in her body to say that because she ' s from a very old fashioned family
uh - huh
and she stayed home and raised her kids and she expected all of her kids to do that too and their wives and to be the housewife and have dinner ready by five and you know be there at every beck and call and
yeah
there ' s so much more now all my income goes for things like luxuries i mean it really does except for what we give to my daughter to you know put her through college and stuff but the rest of it we just buy things like
uh - huh
boats or we go on trips or you know just
right
the more or less like entertainment stuff but
yeah i think you ' ve earned that though
yeah i feel like i have you know because well we ' re to the age now i ' m not old but i ' m older
uh - huh
and i got to stay home with my kids which i really wanted to do but now i could not go back and do it i really couldn ' t i don ' t think i could stay home all the time and do nothing and i mean i did stuff but
yeah
right
yeah i think so i think it would be neat if they could incorporate into small and large businesses both
but
a built in day cares where the children were there in the facility but not necessarily right there with you
well you know more and more of them are i don ' t know if it is up there where you are but where i am the just like all the hospitals they ' re getting day care but the reason they had to do this was because so many people
uh - huh
are they
you know so many women could not afford like you said if you had four kids or even if you had two kids you would be paying
all your salary to pay for those two kids to go so more and more of our hospitals especially over here are getting them and then some of the bigger companies but it ' s mainly the hospitals
right
yeah i don ' t know if the ti in dallas does or not i know i know nobody around here does it we ' re it ' s too small around here yeah
well what are your did you like do you use credit cards
not very often i usually the ones we use is like visa and we always try to pay it back at the end of the month
huh - uh so it doesn ' t gets the credit
i have
right
interest rate is so high that you ' re really if you ' re going to use credit cards you need to use that policy i think don ' t you
yeah
otherwise you end up paying so much more for your merchandise that it ' s hardly
that ' s right
it ' s not a very good idea
do you have a lot of credit cards
well i have a lot of them but i don ' t use them very much though
right
i use them mostly for big things like maybe sometimes
tuition if it ' s
you know if i ' m short to go ahead and get it and then try to get it saved back as quick as i can
the other thing i think if you do get overextended a little bit you need to be sure and pay it off
more than one at a time because i think you could run forever paying what they require
oh yeah
just goes on and on
which is what they want
yeah
i think a lot of people go in debt because they think oh you know i can just charge it but really i mean if they don ' t have the money then they aren ' t going to have it in a month so
yeah that ' s true
they make the mistake of pushing all their cards
there are times when it ' s when it ' s very useful like emergency trip
yeah
or something sometimes when you when you
the money will be available but it ' s
you know not immediately handy i think they ' re very helpful plus the fact that it ' s helpful not to have to carry a lot of money sometimes
right
but i you really do need to be very
oh responsible about it or you end up in deep trouble
it took me quite a while to pay them off
uh - huh
so
after that i decided well i ' m not going to use them at all
and just try to pay cash for everything and that worked for a while and then
we got married so we decided to you know if we used them we would
pay them off as we go so
right
right that can be very handy under those kind of circumstances
the other thing about them is too if you really don ' t you really need to get some and use them because if you have never used them and developed and haven ' t developed a credit thing
it stops you from doing a lot of things if you if you pay for everything by cash there is a lot of things that a lot of people who will not give you credit when you need something like a house or
right
that ' s true yeah
uh - huh
but it ' s true you have to be very careful or you end up
going in the deep end and an awful lot of people are in trouble
um - hum
we have a boy living with us who works for a credit card
company that and he makes calls to people who have problems you know credit problems that are trying to work out of them and
uh - huh
poor thing he comes home very depressed every night
oh
yeah
it ' s a really big problem i think and takes mature people to
to treat it so that it ' s so that it ' s a real advantage to you instead of a disadvantage
right i think the way the tax system was they encouraged people to use credit cards you know with a big write off at the end of the year
yeah
but now it ' s like it ' s punch money because
right it doesn ' t do you any good now does it right
you cannot
right you cannot write off your interest
even before it probably wasn ' t though because you didn ' t get anywhere near as much as what it
yeah
you didn ' t get to claim anywhere near what you ended up paying
so well i ' m not that other than that i don ' t have too much on credit cards but
it ' s good to talk to you
it sounds like you feel like taxes are probably too high
well i think there ' s a big waste of our tax dollar
it does seem that way i was trying to think of whether we pay more tax now than we did ten or twenty years ago but it doesn ' t seem like we get as much out value for the tax dollar
we don ' t we it there ' s too much
pocket stuffing going on as far as different companies contracting to do things for the county and
do projects for the state and you know course they prove that all the time on over the tv
uh - huh
you know
yeah it does seem like the special interest groups are what keeps taxes high
but i
right that i just i just pay you know more taxes than i can imagine if i could get i ' ve got a little piece of property
uh - huh
i just i mean when i tell you little piece of property i mean i ' ve got five and a half acres it ' s out in the country
and if i could get what they ' re charging me for taxes on that i would sell it in a minute
oh boy
you know so that that ' s why i just don ' t
there ' s a lot of you know a lot of expense
as far as our taxes and all the all the hidden costs that they spend our money on that they shouldn ' t be spending our money on
but
yeah that does make it difficult
it does
really does are you an accountant or
well i used to work in finance but i don ' t any longer
uh - huh
i was also trying to think of whether our tax rates are high compared to other countries i seem to recall that many other countries have higher tax rates than ours
but they may also get better value for the dollar that ' s the real question
right well you know i ' ve i can handle the i can handle the tax the amount of taxes that i pay i can handle that
uh - huh
but it
you know when you hit all the bad roads and
and you hear of all the misuse of the money and that
right
that ' s a that ' s a bigger
right that ' s what ' s irritating
problem to me than having to pay them
right
well i think i think one of our and this is really not the total thing not totally on taxes but one of our things is our on our the our
federal government is our why in the world they don ' t get rid of
one of the houses either get rid of the senate or get rid of the congress you know get rid of one of those housing systems and because that ' s costing that ' s costing the taxpayer multimillions
uh - huh
and but they govern each other and they vote their selves in to staying in where they are you know and
i don ' t i ' ve never understood you know why i there is one state what state is in the united states that only has one housing i meant one governing body
hm i don ' t remember hearing that
okay there is there ' s one state i ' ve i in i don ' t know whether it ' s new hampshire it ' s a northern state
or new england state that has one housing body and one governing body and
uh - huh
you know they their taxes are
more well spent
but no i ' ve you know i disagree with a lot of things but a lot of things i can ' t change
but
what part of the country are you from
i ' m from texas but now i live in california
okay
i ' m course i ' m
i ' m from texas too but i think my the two counties that i pay taxes in are two of the highest tax rate counties there are anywhere around here
so
i live in my i have some my little piece of land is in benedict county and i live in smith county
and what state is that in
texas
still in texas
still in texas you hear this texas accent
course in texas at least you still don ' t have income tax
well i think we pay it in other ways
child care seems to be a topic that
varies i guess with where you are geographically if you ' re in an area where you got a lot to select from then i guess there are a lot of criterias to choose from but if you ' re in an area where there ' s two or three then you get what you can take
yeah
and i guess it ' d depend on the age of the child the needs of the child how long the child has to be there if it ' s a five day a week deal i would certainly look a lot harder than if it was just a couple of days a month
oh yeah
and we ' re in a situation where it ' s just one maybe two days a month at best so we ' re
well that ' s lucky
in only a couple of hours usually what we use them for now is to transport them between school and the day care center and have them wait there just long enough for me to get off work and go pick them up
yeah that ' s good
so it ' s nice to just have them there for the limited time frame but the
the drawback is the pay structures there ' s so many different situations that these day care centers have to get into they have a lot of the ones have just decided that
they will simplify their work load by saying if you get on the bus to ride between school and day care you ' ll pay ten dollars regardless of whether you road one way or both ways and regardless of whether you stayed there just half an hour or three hours
um - hum
oh
they just averaged it all out but most kids stay until about six so it will be about ten dollars which will cover the ride and cover the hours you stay
wow
yeah
and i ' ve got one kid getting out at two forty five and one getting out at three thirty so the one gets picked up at two forty five gets there by about three
um - hum
and i ' m there a little before four o ' clock to pick them up
so he doesn ' t stay there even an hour and the other child is not even there when i get there and doesn ' t get there until about four it ' s about thirty minutes to do a ten minute ride in there little bus and
yeah
so the you know just for the doesn ' t really work out for us too economical to pay twenty dollars for a one way bus ride for these two kids but some days we have to do it some days it just works out to where i don ' t get into work early enough to get off
yeah i can see that
early enough to get them but fortunately the other end of the deal is some days my wife
yeah
being a dental hygienist works by appointments so she if she has a day scheduled where she has to get the kids into the day care to of them take them to school and she has a
yeah
an appointment say at eight thirty and she has to be all the way across town at her office at eight thirty then she needs to have them ride the bus one way and i ' ll get off in time to hopefully pick both of them up and not have the day care center in the other direction
but just a myriad of possibilities that these people have to serve so they have a myriad of pay structures but it can get expensive most of them run
yeah
four some as many as five dollars an hour per child for what we call drop in care which is the situation we ' re in we ' re not a regular so the days we do use them we pay through the nose and
yeah
oh i bet
and make their kids stay there we found on in the area that is letting us pay as little as two fifty an hour that ' s still five dollars an hour for two of our kids and it it ' s fun we try to keep it to a minimum
yeah
yeah it ' s
i when i was i was a commercial artist for almost six years before we started our family and i looked into child care and
and we were living in we were living in dallas my husband was working at the north building at the time and we just didn ' t like anything we saw we really i didn ' t want to leave an infant
um - hum
with the child care that was in it in the immediate area
right
um - hum
yeah
well even if you work out the economics if you get over all the other hurdles of the ratio of workers to kids and the infant
worker areas how well that ' s closed off or how not well that ' s closed off from the other noise
yeah
once you get over all the other hurdles just the economics of it it ' s not
as much of an impact to stay home as it were if you figure in what it would cost you to go back to work and you know the
right oh that ' s exactly what it was with us it was just it was we all we had to do was we pay off a vehicle early
and then i would have just been paying for that and child care was my salary and it wasn ' t worth it
yep
that
that ' s it
so it was
no it ' s not
so it ' s gotten it ' s changed a little bit over the years but
yeah it is so expensive down here for a child care because we ' re originally from missouri and most of our family ' s still there and my husband ' s sisters have their kids in child care and it ' s a lot less expensive then it is down here
um - hum
right
it ' s amazingly less expensive than it is
well what the market can bear and
yeah oh it oh yeah
boy there are kids in this little section of plano that we ' re in we ' re surrounded
less than a mile we have six different centers to our at our disposal so
wow
we can go north to two of them or south to three of them or just over west a little bit further and there ' s two more over there there ' s just all around us but and we ' ve been to everyone of them over the time
that ' s lucky
but the kids the kids just well we used to use them a little more than we do now that they ' re in school and the kids just kind of get tired of them
that ' s lucky
uh - huh
they get tired of the you know what ' s available to play on and what ' s outside and plus they tend to just shift around in who runs them for a while and the pay structure changes and
really
so we ' ve just moved with wherever ' s it happens to be cheapest and they happen to want to survive at and they want to live at this one for a while
yeah
and we found it cheaper even during the summer for me to take off for half a day since we work a four and a half day work week and come home on these thursdays that she goes to work at eleven and get ' s off at seven thirty at night
uh - huh
and that she does that on thursdays and then occasional saturday ' s and i can take off on those thursday ' s and be home in time for her to go off to work and it ' s cheaper for me to do that and take my vacation even if i
um - hum
take all thirteen weeks of summer that ' s less than right at a weeks full week ' s worth of vacation and i have you know three weeks a year i ' m i ' ve been there long enough to do that
wow
yeah
now i always end up in a must take situation anyway so
yeah
we decided to eat it up that way and still take a week off and still have a few days to for whatever week long weekends or the like and
i think we ' re going to do that again this summer like we did last summer because we paid close to seven or eight hundred dollars just to have someone come into the home
at a couple a dollars an hour
to take care of them on those thursdays throughout the summer so
yeah
it it ' s hard to find the prices i guess that does seem to be one of the major driving factors
i know oh it is it plus when we were in the section of north dallas over by addison there ' s just not hardly any day care over there at all it ' s surprising
yeah
because of the when i was searching for it the best place i could find in the area was it was way down in farmers branch and i worked in carrollton it just and i was i was going to have to drive and drive and drive and it was just it was just
oh boy
like up here in mckinney there ' s a few places there ' s i think there ' s i ' ve seen two up here
and there ' s just really not very much
well i guess they haven ' t had the i don ' t know what the incentive would be but
that ' s true
oh yeah a lot of people drive into dallas from here a lots of them
yeah
it must be on what they ' re counting on
so
yeah i assume so
okay
it ' s hard topic because is it is it is it doing a good job or a bad job and you got to divide it two different categories whether you live in the city or whether you live in a more rural place like i do
yeah and are you talking about public schools being lower level high school level or
well public school all the way up kindergarten all the way up to high school
state school
okay but you ' re excluding high - level education
yes well yeah i am
actually i think that i at the higher level education i don ' t think there ' s so much of a problem there it ' s pretty much funded well there are small colleges that i ' m sure are struggling
okay
but it ' s the job that the high school and the grade schools are doing that i see in a area like ours our school even a bad school is a good school up here where if i lived in new york city or washington dc
i would seriously consider moving if i had a child i wouldn ' t let them go to a public school system there but of course people are trapped economically and they can ' t do that
yeah i know down here the school ' s are you know i don ' t know they rate i moved to arkansas and texas after living in ohio and the schools down here rate you know bottom ten percent across the country and
having been through grade school up there and coming down here to high school i can understand why because they ' re so far behind and so poorly staffed half the time the teachers don ' t know what ' s going on
well that ' s really too bad because it it ' s giving some people unfair advantage i mean we our high school up here is like a junior college in florida what we learned
right
well that was my experience going through junior high up there when i came down south for high school i was just repeating what i ' d already done
yeah
because we were so far advanced and the you know i ' d been in a parochial school before junior high and you know even the public schools are behind the parochial schools
yeah
so you know i like the concept they ' ve got now where they have more directed education you know you pick a career path or you get counseling earlier
and then you learn the things that help you rather than spending four years learning the same things over and over
oh they have that down there that
well they talk about it and there are a few in some of the more like in i live in a big metroplex and some of the better parts of the metroplex the suburbs that are richer have those kind of target schools
but you know
yeah it ' s like if your father owns a grocery store and you ' re really interested in that there ' s no reason that you should take college prep courses when you can get some general business courses in high school
right
or if you ' re going to go the science route you can go to a target school that specializes in science or art you know there ' s no point in you know i ' m an engineering student and if i have to go take art classes you know i ' m not going to use them
and through high school i could have gone so much further if i ' d gone to a school that was directed
yeah that ' s where i was fortunate i ' m a i ' m a technician and we had a vocational electronics in our high school
right in high school
so when i went to my first year of tech school i had a very easy time because our high school had a good program
right
i think the schools today you know the public schools are just they ' re just overrun you know they don ' t know what to do there ' s too many kids and not enough teachers and too many kids don ' t care
yeah i find that the that in the in the cities it ' s more less the kids go there
and
to socialize not really to learn and the parents send them there because they ' re supposed to and plus it gets them out of their hair and i also find that
right
that you can send a kid to school but if don ' t work with them as a parent i think you ' re putting your child at a big disadvantage
yeah and you know there ' s some kids that you know want to go learn but most of them just want to go play
trying to work and or maybe they ' re unemployed and they ' re mad at the world i can see where that wouldn ' t be very good for a kid you know he ' s coming up will you help me with my homework and they ' re no get away from me i ' ve had a terrible day
so it ' s got a lot to do with economics in the area that you come from
yeah that ' s true i ' m wondering with the boom down here it ' s well not at the moment but a lot of the industry ' s moving southward
so oh i don ' t know
i say we because i live here if that might not turn around in the next you know fifteen twenty years
yeah
hopefully they ' ll promote good schools because i know the town that i come from the large ibm plant has something to do with the top rated high school
because of their tax base for one and plus for the type of student that ' s going to that school it ' s going to raise the level of the school
right
because your parents are engineers or chemists they ' re you ' re most likely to do better in school they ' re going to help you
you hope
i mean jeez my parents always helped me and i don ' t know it ' s just like you say it ' s the way you ' re raised and the economic situation you ' re in
i guess you just have to wonder is it up to the is it you know who whose supposed to make the change the state the federal government you know where ' s the money supposed to come from is it
i don ' t know actually i think it i think it should be a civic level the city level and a system level really to find out and to see what they need and not overinflate it
you know what do you advocate more taxes or better management of what they got
like if the teachers are getting six percent raises every year when people in industry have been getting cut back and you ' re getting raises every eighteen months you got to go hey now wait a minute we ' re in a recession here
we our town didn ' t pass the school budget this year and for the first time in many years just because people are in the recession and they ' re even though
we ' ve enjoyed very good employment here for the past ten years now we got eight percent unemployment when it used to be four or five people are going whoa
yeah
so
starts hitting closer to home
and what you can do unless you just get down to the parent level and then if you ' re in a bad situation where you have to send your child to a bad school
in some places you couldn ' t go to a public school it was miles down the road and the only school you could go to was the baptist school or the catholic school so
yeah they ' re a lot more strict
yeah the i don ' t
you have to learn you aren ' t given the chance to you know screw off all the time
or anything that would contribute see this isn ' t a subject that i think a lot about because i ' m never faced with it because our school system in vermont it seems to do a really good job
well i know i ' m in the you know the only reason i asked about secondary schools or you know advanced education is because down here you know going to the university of texas the education i ' m getting i think is kind of shoddy for a public school
is it
i don ' t think i ' m getting what i should but you know in texas it ' s next to free because they pay so much of it it ' s state supported
but at the same time it ' s really not it ' s not like going to mit my engineering degree will be nothing like somebody coming out of mit and that ' s it ' s really too bad
well that
but that ' s i don ' t know i think it just builds on the foundation that they ' ve already built you get people out of high schools and junior colleges that don ' t have the background for an mit kind of curriculum so
well
okay what kind of foods would you have
okay
well i like to cook but i don ' t like getting too awfully fancy about it just because
hum - um
uh - huh
well yeah you can ' t enjoy it right
and so i don ' t like to arrive or when they arrive for me to be completely worn out so
yeah exactly
uh - huh yeah
uh - huh
yeah
uh - huh
we just had a bunch of people over and we had we did lasagna and garlic bread and ah yummy
boy i like that
yeah well i ' m planning a and naturally this is appropriate because i ' m planning dinner for people tomorrow night and the next night hm on tuesday night there ' ll be eight people here altogether so
oh good
i ' d say one thing we ' ve have done quite a bit through the holidays just because it ' s a real easy is just baked potato dinners
oh yeah uh - huh
and have you like three or four couples come over and i ' ll do the potatoes and you know like butter and cheese and stuff and have everybody else just bring a couple of toppings whatever they like
uh - huh
and it turns out great because i mean you ' ve got like hot sauce and taco meat and barbecue and you know bacon and all that good stuff
yeah that ' s fun
uh - huh
but it ' s inexpensive plus it ' s real easy on the hostess because you can just have the potatoes ready and just have a salad with it and you got a great dinner
yeah
yeah that ' s a good idea
yeah
uh - huh yeah
uh - huh
it ' s we invariably end up at my house since i ' ve got two kids and that it ' s fine because then i can just say okay fine you bring this you bring this you bring this we ' re done oh it ' s pretty cool
uh - huh
yeah that ' s good well one of my favorites if i don ' t wanna have other people bring stuff i just wanna treat them is to make chicken and rice it ' s very easy to
uh - huh
oh
oh
you don ' t like it oh you do okay yeah i have a really easy recipe for that where you just brown the chicken and then you
hm
put rice in the bottom of the pan you pour bouillon or chicken broth over it and or you put the chicken in then pour the broth over and you can put mushrooms in if you want and then just
oh
over the uncooked rice
yeah over uncooked rice and you can either microwave it or do it in the oven and it just it fluffs up and it ' s really moist and
oh
oh how neat
huh now i ' ve done it with where you put you cook the well i guess you probably could do it some way but cook the rice and then take a can of like cream of mushroom soup or cream of chicken soup and a bit of white wine in it
um - hum
uh - huh ooh yeah
and every once in a while i ' ll put in white i ' ll slice white grapes and i ' ll put it in there and
that ' s because i ' m not a real big wine person but i like it adds something to the chicken and then just bake it and it makes a wonderful sauce over the rice
hm well i ' ll keep that one in mind too yeah
yeah
uh - huh
yeah you can get away with it and you know in having a semi nice dinner or you know semi formal but
oh yeah
but then i hadn ' t thought about doing it with uncooked rice so just like in a thirteen by nine pan
yeah
yeah you put in let ' s see what was it three quarters of cup of rice or
hm
hm
it depends on you can really vary it but you have to put the water in proportionally i can ' t remember i think it was three quarters cup rice to two cups water two cups broth
uh - huh
huh
yeah it ' s i use that for rice and for when i cook pasta or something i ' ll put a little bit of bouillon in there just to give it a little extra flavor
and
yeah that ' s flavor um - hum
hm now that would be good how long do you have to bake it
yeah
but i think it ' s about an hour or maybe it ' s only half hour hm
how long would it be in the how long would it be in the microwave
you just until the rice looks fluffy and not overdone you know before it gets overdone
oh okay
yeah i ' d let it cook just a little bit just so that the cooking goes a little faster but
okay hm
yeah well i liked it your idea too there
uh - huh
yeah
or chopped onions if you wanna do that you know whatever you however much effort you feel like putting into it but it makes a great i mean i ' ve got a two year old and a four year old and they love it
uh - huh
well i need to find out from you how the last
remodeling project you undertook and if it was successful and you were pleased with what happened
well
you ' ve been doing any remodeling lately
the only remodeling we do is we put new we put up molding and wallpaper and we put it up in chad ' s room and in the
uh - huh
front room
all right did you like the results
but i let the
yeah i don ' t do the actual
putting i don ' t actually cut them the molding i mean we have a guy come in and do that and we do the painting and the sanding and then i built some shelves in the basement last week so i guess that qualifies
uh - huh
all right
yes it does what kind of molding is this molding
crown molding and then some chair molding but
oh
uh - huh
well that ' s a lot of fun we
i guess maybe we will have to do some new projects when the baby comes
oh yeah decorate a nursery or something huh
yeah well you know we got the tv in this room
that ' s probably have to be converted to a bedroom so
oh okay yes get some get an extra room there for the new baby
what ' s that
any remodeling really
no we ' ve done some painting and put up some wallpaper in the boys ' room
uh - huh
we needed to paint because the paint was getting dingy or grain plus there was a lot of markings on the on the paint that
well on top of the bunk beds the boys got up there and started drawing on the ceiling and that was kind of hard to get off so we decided rather than wash it all off and clean it up we decided to paint over it
uh - huh
the walls were textured and there was a lot of holes from the previous owners and so we patched them all up and painted and put border and wallpaper along the top
and it looks really nice now and we we ' re quite pleased with it and
um - hum
it looks pretty good there ' s a lot of other things that cheryl would like me to do but
yeah
well good
i think i might paint the cement you can there ' s supposedly kind of a cement paint you can get that will make it just a little nicer even you know before we finish it
uh - huh
well good you put on a deck there recently too haven ' t you or that ' s been a couple of years
well parts of the cement had a patio i painted the our porch
uh - huh
wow
painted it with
well good
yeah we have one
they work pretty well really they ' re noisy
yes i
yeah they are they make a lot of noise but they ' re good
yeah
we haven ' t used ours yet we ' d like to use ours
you haven ' t used it at all
no i haven ' t
oh so you don ' t you don ' t know how wait the only thing you ' ve got to worry about is getting the paint the right viscosity
yeah so it doesn ' t jam up
you ' ve used one before though it sounds like
yes i have
yeah
it was my dad ' s and i used it with him
um - hum
and was able to paint some things and
and he said he didn ' t need it anymore and he gave it to us and we haven ' t had a chance to or need to paint anything down here yet i i ' m kind of leery about using it inside
oh
yeah
because it does put a lot of particles and mist in the air that i didn ' t want to get all over the carpet or
yeah
yeah it puts out a lot and i mean i even us that one when we did that porch
uh - huh
yeah
it was just it was white
oh it was
yeah because the porch the porch spindles are white
yeah that ' s right that ' s right
and
it was a latex we had a kind of hard time getting it thin enough latex is kind of rubbery to begin with a little thicker than most but it ended up working fine plus i was the weather you know i did it in
oh
yes
um - hum
oh good
well the winter started to cool down i think it must have been october when i finished
um - hum
yeah i remember it was a conference weekend i think when i finished
well the weather i understand was pretty good at that time
yeah was it was not bad but
yeah the weather
weather is beautiful down here real nice real nice it got up to about seventy five degrees down here and that ' s kind of the right temperature to be painting things but
is it
yeah
yeah it ' s we would like to like to do a little bit more we ' ll probably do some we were working recently out on our spa
hum - um
and hot tub trying it was really overgrown with a lot of
especially during the reagan now bush administrations
we seem to have a double standard in place over how we treat them countries down there for example
a left wing regime or communist regime is god awful and basically you know satan incarnate
while nations like for a long time el salvador and guatemala
with right wing regimes we kind of just winked at things like death squads and alike yeah we found nicaragua to be the most horrible thing in the earth
right
and i just felt and it ' s the same thing with cuba that we really seem to have this kind of double standard down there
whereas if your regime doesn ' t want to bother us a reason of threat to us we ' ll kind of ignore you
you can do whatever you want but if you invite the commies in you know look out
or if it doesn ' t even have to be commies if it ' s just a little left of what the prevailing attitude is in the united states it was bad somehow and
certainly the right wing death squads were just as
deadly if not more so than anything set up by any of the left wing governments
um - hum
if people are coming from left wing countries it was viewed that they were
only seeking economic benefits and not actually escaping death threats
whereas if they were coming from am i saying this correctly or if
if they were coming from right wing regimes
you wouldn ' t want them in
we wouldn ' t let them in yeah
yeah it ' s like how many guatemalan and el salvador refugees have we seen and heard about in the last ten years
yet nicaraguan refugees for the longest time were welcome with open arms as escapees and
um - hum
and any communist type of regime down there i mean the whole the whole farce in granada
oh gosh what an embarrassment
right was it just
no with
down there and that seems to be well we ' ll give you aid but oh no not to feed your people no we want you to clean up
right what was the whole thing with panama i mean here we were paying noriega for years
and then suddenly
we go in and bomb his country and
in panama and try and indite him i don ' t understand what that was all about
well it ' s the same thing that happened with iraq for years and years
here we are sending money over here playing these people off of each other it ' s was same thing in iraq playing saddam hussein off you know off of iran
in this case panama off of nicaragua and cuba and any of the other left wing regimes down there
and
and for what does it leave us with absolutely nothing
i mean it wouldn ' t surprise me
truly
and i just think you know we have this kind of short term we are not interested in developing the region unless there ' s big business involved and wants to get involved down there
right it ' s sort of it ' s our little colony is that they do just if they provide the labor and the debiting of
of ford or
the
united fruit then that ' s fine
well you called here so
okay well
maybe so far it ' s been enough it seems like it seems like
subjects
you know and allocated towards the aids research i think that aids research has been a lot of the funding has not been done by the government a lot of it has been done by private endowment
but i think the government is doing a good job so far
of keeping the their portion of the funding up
well i agree to an extent i think the problem is that
we ' re spending money and one of the things that the government likes to do when they ' re under public pressure is to throw money at the problem
um - hum
um - hum
right
and i think that while we need to spend more effort and money on things like education and maybe even alternative treatments and alternative things to keep those afflicted alive at this point
um - hum
i think that any money that is given must be given carefully just to something that is a proven point not just thrown at it
um - hum
i don ' t see that the money is being removed from any other causes
aids has been a problem though especially in the eighties
when there wasn ' t a lot of private dollars around because of the stigma of the disease
uh - huh
and that people really didn ' t groups didn ' t wanna be associated with it because it was a morals issue
right
i think that it we need to spend a lot more on education and try and get over this thing that we have about
not confronting this head on with some factual advertising for items of condoms and things like that
um - hum
exactly it although i was i was shocked at the public outrage that occurred after i think it was dan quayle who said
likely most effective solution is you know abstinence and yet the a large portion of the community said well that ' s stupid you know that just shows that you have no interest in spending any money on the on the problem and i thought
that ' s not that ' s not the point at all
well the problem is that with this administration at least when they say abstinence
they often couch that in other things that turn into one of these morals issues
which makes it turn into a political issue now you see the problem is you have people in the national institutes of health in atlanta and the like the centers for disease control which
um - hum
have fundamentalists in charge of the thing who won ' t even let you say condom in a meeting
right
and these things have been spread around and immediately people think well abstinence okay here we have these religious zealots telling us
where they ' re trying to ignore the problem blah and of course they overreact when you say that the fact that it ' s just good medical safe practice you know don ' t expose yourself in the first place
um - hum
um - hum
but the it ' s because the you know this administration was around when reagan when the disease first was discovered here and all the social you know implications of the reagan administration ignoring it when it first became an issue and
um - hum
see that ' s all carrying over now
right
and that ' s why you ' re seeing that
yeah there is because what happened is a lot of these people and staff members are political appointees
um - hum
from the south especially who come along with a variety of different religious beliefs
some of which held very fervent beliefs
and will take their beliefs into the workplace in and in this case a lot of people consider that to be standing in the way of science and medicine to try and solve this thing
um - hum
do you have kids
oh yeah i got three how about yourself
we have two and another one on the way
oh you ' ve got young children then
well we yeah we do we have a our a six year old he ' s oldest and then our baby will be a year on monday
oh my goodness that ' s great
yeah
what kind of mix do you have a boy and a girl or
two boys two boys yeah
two boys
no i i ' m just about three months and i don ' t think we really even wanna find out we like surprises so we ' ll take either
i don ' t blame you
well we got two boys and a girl well we got two boys and a girl well
and does it are the two boys first
yes so maybe you ' ll get lucky and get a girl this time
oh
maybe huh we kind of like our boys though too so
well our boys one is
he ' s in graduate school at a & m he ' s in the navy he ' s a lieutenant in the navy and the navy ' s sending him for his master ' s in ocean engineering
oh my goodness
we got another boy that ' s out in maryland he ' s a wildlife biologist
oh
and our girl is thirteen she ' s in
seventh grade so we got
still all sorts good activities with her
oh yeah you ' ve kind of got a span there huh oh well what do you do with your seventh grader

it ' s for
what they call pace group i don ' t know if you ' ve gotten into that with your kids but that ' s for the
kind of
well it ' s a program for
advanced
higher the advanced kids yeah
yeah i have heard of that our little boy ' s just in the first grade and i taught school
sure
oh okay
okay you know what that
well my wife is involve she kind of heads that up for these kids and
last year they got the state level they didn ' t win that but they got won local and region and they got a new mix of kids this time so
oh uh - huh
keeps them busy keeps
oh yeah i bet huh well so does she go actually out into a different classroom with
with other kids that are involved in this
well yes but well they have what they well you probably know a pace group that
they ' re advanced type the they ' re special
classes for pace classes i think this happens to be
yeah
history is what their peace classes is this year but so they
oh uh - huh
she enjoys that kind of stuff and does well with it so yeah
oh that ' s neat
challenging huh oh
yeah always something to do
yeah
well as far as our activities we ' re kind of on a different level here but my
yeah my husband ' s gonna take our six year old to the monster truck show tonight
okay
that ' d be fun
oh yeah
but we don ' t have any real like we don ' t really ski we haven ' t taken our kids skiing or anything course the baby ' s young
yeah he ' s
the what
you got to go tobogganing and sledding with them
oh well yeah we have done that he in fact he just goes right out here we ' ve got quite a bit of snow now and last week we got a lot
well you ' re welcome to keep that
well i grew up in wisconsin i had plenty of snow and when i was a kid and
oh
we ' ve lived here about seventeen years but we used to take all the kids tobogganing and ice skating and all that kind of stuff the boys and it ' s a lot of fun really
yeah
it is fun
as long as you don ' t have to drive in it
yeah i no i don ' t like that i really i it makes me nervous yeah
i had plenty of snow to last me forever i don ' t
care if i ever see any well i don ' t care if i see it but
yeah oh i don ' t mind it but us the winter gets long
yes
you know i get ready if that come about this time of year i ' m kind of ready for it to start getting spring and it ' s too early yet so
well you got you got you got five months before you ' ll see that
and i guess
okay so do you have any favorite teams
well
not quite huh
made it yeah made it all the way through four years of college playing ball but
well that ' s pretty good
anyway being in rochester you probably like the mets
yes i ' m actually a met ' s fan i ' m one of these people who ' s actually a
die hard met fan and an avid yankee hater
oh boy it the i think it ' s like one or the other isn ' t it i mean you either
yeah it ' s i find it very strange more people you know real met fans don ' t like the yankees and real yankee fans don ' t like the mets for some reason
yeah
i never i never quite found a new york fan
i ' ve always found a fan you know of either one or the other and
so that of course means that when it comes to the american league my favorite team is the red sox
oh okay
by default because i went to college also in boston
i see yeah i like the i guess if i had to pick a favorite team i ' d i
anymore well as i kind of grew up rooting for philadelphia
oh
i ' m from new jersey originally
yeah so that that ' s sort of close enough
yeah well we were thirty miles south of them so
oh so you were pretty close
right yeah right down the river but so what are the mets going to do this year without strawberry
well i don ' t know there ' s a part of me that says that you know i ' m sort of glad strawberry went away
you know when he sort of went away i started thinking yeah well he was performing fairly well but he really wasn ' t worth the baggage you know
yeah
i think they ' re okay i think they ' re you know i think they have enough people who are
who are who are still in their prime you know i mean certainly if you look at them compared to let ' s say you know
um - hum
yeah
i certainly don ' t think that they ' re the eighty six team anymore
yeah i
right that was year they beat houston in extra innings and then and then they actually won the series by
by sort of a sneaky route against boston
yeah
yeah
i felt real bad about that but hey what can you do
that ' s right well actually he was supposedly there was there was something wrong with him at the time and i
well his knees were bothering him yeah
right and i and i understand that and i say hey if the guy can ' t play you don ' t blame the team that hit it to him you blame the team you know for putting him in
yeah for having him out there
that ' s right so
so i was i was also i was in school at boston at the time
oh boy
so i it was actually wonderful because where i was there were half met fans and half sox fans
yeah i think we were all pretty much astros fans in the in the national league championship series but there ' s like two fellows
oh
from brooklyn
after the
well that ' s good well yeah brooklyn boys i guess
yeah
yeah
yeah so i was also born in brooklyn so i so i can call myself a brooklyn thug although i ' m really not
okay well i ' m not to say that all folks from brooklyn are thugs but these two were definitely thugs and they were from brooklyn
so i ' m kind of hoping i guess anymore i pretty much pull for the rangers though they were they ' re they have the i think they have the best
facilities in the major leagues
yeah
i love going to watch a game in arlington stadium it ' s great
well that that ' s actually i think that makes something because i think and as much as sort of fan support helps
yeah
you know it ' s good to have
the only problem is it ' s not large enough it only holds about i think they when ryan struck out his five thousandth player they squeezed about forty thousand people in there
yes it is kind of small
yeah so they ' re they have plans i mean the owner tried to move them to florida but
right
they ended up sticking around in arlington and they ' re going to build a new stadium in arlington as a matter of fact not even in dallas so that ' s
oh that ' s
oh that ' s great so
that ' s something that we ' re looking forward to
and
yeah exactly
yeah have you seen a game up there
i haven ' t been to any toronto games yet but
oh boy i saw i was up there on business last june and watched a game in the sky dome it was just phenomenal that ' s probably the pattern for the future of stadiums i think
of stadiums yeah well i mean to get up there i mean the best i ' ve been up here so far you know up in up state new york is
yeah
uh - huh
a rochester red wings game
now is rochester where is cornell university
cornell is in ithaca
ithaca
yeah so cornell is about somewhere about two and a half hours south of south and east of us
okay
so if you know where lake ontario is sort of
yeah well rochester ' s like right on the shores isn ' t it
yeah we ' re about ten miles south of lake ontario actually whoever built the city was an idiot in my opinion because they built it they built it far enough from the city that it actually couldn ' t be a port city
yeah okay
okay
but that
well they say that from that space needle up in toronto you can see the lights of rochester on a clear night
oh really i hadn ' t actually known that
yeah
well
but we have our own our own triple a team here
yeah
the redwings which is the farm team for the orioles so everybody hopes that they go all the way around here they ' re the they ' re the big team in rochester
yeah okay
yeah
those games are fun to watch you watch those games
oh i yeah i actually we make a point of going to a bunch of them every year because they ' re fun because they ' re
yeah
lots of really big you know lots of local fans you know small stadium you know and they ' ll get a crowd of less than ten thousand sometimes you know
um - hum
especially you know and i ' ll make a day game or something but they really seem to people really get into it i mean i
yeah
i can ' t i again i can ' t make any predictions about them but i suspect they ' ll go they ' ll go far
yeah we used to like watching my folks lived down in beaumont and on the campus of lamar university they used to house the beaumont golden gators
who were a double a team for the padres i think but they were fun games to watch
yeah those are those are always the i think those are more fun than major league games sometimes
yes it ' s true well
it ' s one of the advantages of not having pitchers who are you know i guess when you start pitching real well move them up bam you know there goes the little the worst team
yeah
yeah
yeah but so what
but they they ' ve got so much young raw talent it ' s just amazing and then they just haven ' t been able to put anything together
well the way i the way i see it is i mean you know i can use a met analogy here
um - hum
if you ' ll think back a few years to when the mets were just all this sort of young bunch of guys who really were raw talent but weren ' t very sort of
well trained you know back to the you know maybe eighty four or eighty three or eighty five you know when they were first when they weren ' t quite the eighty six team that they were
yeah
um - hum
right
i that probably gives the readers a good shot for you know this year or next year i think it you know the young talent really sort of has to build itself up
yeah i mean they ' ve been
they ' ve been young for a while and they ' re almost starting to age a little bit here i just yeah they they ' re really hurting pitching wise i mean they ' ve got ryan but you know who knows
what he ' ll be able to do he ' s been last year he started having some nagging injuries and
right but that that ' s if
but it ' ll be interesting to watch i hope to get up there we usually try to get to opening day game there ' s several guys from our church try to go up there
oh that must be nice
yeah well i guess we ' re probably oh maybe a hundred fifty miles south of dallas
no not too bad about it takes about two hours two and a half hours to get there
yeah well it ' d take me a good seven hours to get to shay stadium
so i don ' t know i don ' t
that ' s probably because of the roads you just don ' t yeah we we ' ve just got a freeway we just get right on the freeway and just go north
yeah well actually we can we can i can take a highway the whole way down but it ' s still it ' s
well it ' s so crowded up there
golly
barring traffic so it ' s it it ' s you know it ' s a heck of a drive we are substantially north of new york enough that we don ' t get to go play
yeah
too often
well i don ' t know you ' re like a boat ride from how far is it across the lake to canada toronto
toronto
yeah
you do you drive there or do you take the ferry or what
i can i ' ve actually i ' ve driven
but i ' ve heard about the ferry as well haven ' t taken it yet though have you taken it
yeah
yeah it ' s a it ' s a beautiful city
yeah i really love i think that ' s one of the most enjoyable things about being up here i ' m only up here for school
i really like it
um - hum
so i
so and then and then you go back to new york after school
no probably south maybe texas actually
or new york city
oh really
well what kind of weather are you having right now
right now we ' re actually having
it ' s getting nice i mean it was in the high fifties today but three and a half weeks ago we had an ice storm
oh boy yeah we ' ve been up in the oh seventies eighties even up in the nineties a couple weeks ago already
oh that ' s great
we ' re it ' s
yeah well about that same time branches were falling off everywhere and we were actually in a state of emergency for two weeks
golly because of the ice
okay it didn ' t make the national news too much which i find really weird
hum
but we were i mean you know all schools were closed for almost for over or for a week
golly
there were certain parts of town where it was illegal to drive
huh illegal
yeah because they had so many power lines down and so many
why don ' t you go ahead and start
okay well i think the court systems could stand some improvement
trial by jury is good but a lot of time it
in a lot of cases
is circumstantial evidence that convicts a person which i don ' t think is all the time good because
sometimes it ' s hard to get all the facts and to prove a person innocent
i mean prove a person guilty if you don ' t really know or you don ' t really have a eyewitness
and how can you convict somebody on circumstantial evidence is beyond me i don ' t know
so you think if trials were held by judges or experts that they would tend not to admit or not to convict people on circumstantial evidence
i think so
in germany when i was a student and
um - hum
that ' s the sort of system they have the trials are held by a panel of
right
they do the questioning also the judges do the questioning and
um - hum
it ' s i think it ' s a lot harder to get off on technicalities also because they
the judge is also sort of a jury
but i ' m not sure i like that i think i prefer the jury system myself
you think you prefer the jury you think your chances are better
well that ' s true
because anytime the government
is the government against the individual you need some yeah they need the protection of ordinary citizens i think that ' s really the only thing i guess where i would like to see the system change is
there ought to be well
i guess i don ' t think that
juries need to decide sentencing all the time i think maybe the a judge is a better judge of that or
um - hum
well sometimes the sentencing is still is not fair
i mean even if well the jury i guess they do decide that but i ' m like you in a case like that most time its
i don ' t know maybe i ' m too
conservative when it come to that the sentencing is really light compared to what i think they should be in a lot of cases
yeah
you know
well if you drag twelve people into a courtroom i trust them to make the right decision as to whether someone ' s guilty or innocent that ' s usually a matter of who to believe and what facts to believe
right
but people who don ' t have day in and day out life long experience with
what prison ' s really like and what the options are to ask them to decide for one case on one person based on what they see i think that
is maybe a little bit naive
yeah
in texas here people tend to get whipped up into a frenzy and slap long sentences on people
um - hum
it ' s kind of a
right
i guess
i guess i like the system that they have in some places where the defendant gets to choose whether he ' s goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets to choose it some cases in some jurisdictions they can do that
oh really
i kind of like that system yeah
yeah that ' s not a bad system
but i do think it need to be shaken up a little bit but the thing is too maybe they need more of
yeah
i don ' t know more of a expert types
yeah
to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick you know joe blow or whoever
and a good citizen or whoever and call them in
right
and lawyers blow sand in their eyes
i would like to see most civil cases tried before a panel of experts instead of ordinary juries
right exactly
insurance cases and things like that
yeah
and there ' d be more honest settlements instead of this
tugging of people ' s heart strings and making them cry and feel like they ' re doing somebody good by giving them
um - hum
putting on a act or whatever
so
oh they range from
from needlepoint to
anything in the hobby field as far as needlework is concerned
i ' ve had to give it up recently because i ' ve got problems with nerves in my right hand but basically it ' s anything in that hobby line i ' ll try anything including making earrings
hum that sounds interesting
i have no love of yard work for hobby work though how about you
well my i ' ve got some fairly bizarre but i do a lot of flying aerobatics for one
oh fantastic
oh
so but probably if i had to say my most favorite one was probably be flying
i ' ve been in a
glider
which as a student piot pilot
i loved it immensely
did you oh you actually tried it before
as a student pilot yeah
as a student pilot
how long did you do it
i was only in one trip
it was something i would have liked to have kept up but we moved out of colorado so that was you know that ended that point
but yeah that i ' ll try as far as you could say hobby then i ' ll try anything that ' s unusual that i ' ve never done once
hum
just to find out what it ' s like the experience oh as
but that ' s not a constant hobby you know like i ' ll do oh i ' ll pick up normally a petit point or anything in stitchery type of line
and if i ' m really bored i ' ll even pick up something and color it
but i do a lot of designing also
hum
well needlepoint looks pretty
i think you know if it ' s done real you know if it ' s done right it looks really good
well i ' ve done a petit point which is really extremely hard
and that was very difficult for me it took me oh i think that almost took me a year and a half to finish that
hum
and petit point is like if you ' ve seen
regular needlepoint it ' s one half of that in the stitches
and it goes down like real small little tiny it ' s exactly what it says petit point
boy that ' s tedious
yes it was tedious i dropped it as i said it took me about a year and a half because it ' s not something i could continuously do
but now i ' m into more taking something that i like and trying to actually put it onto paper myself
hum
which i find more enjoyment that ' s got a lot of math to it at that point
what type of scenes do you do
this last one i ' m trying to do a house there ' s a house here in plano actually it ' s a real estate office
but it has
it ' s oh i would say it every section of this real estate office is a different type of a structure
it goes from almost castle looking on one side to a very old fashioned look on the other side and it just varies in each little section of this real estate office
and i think they did it because of that purpose it is a real estate office
but it fascinates me the way they ' ve done it and it ' s it looks good it ' s all done in brick the windows even vary on it
and that ' s it really fascinates me so i ' ve sat across the street from it and i ' ve tried to put it down on the paper now
hum
i ' ve been over to plano quite a few times my brother lives over there and i ' ve yet to see anything like that over there
it ' s on
let ' s see fifteenth and park
oh okay so it ' s on the other side
well i live right around here
but it ' s not if you drive by it you don ' t notice it
because it ' s all brick there ' s no difference in the front except you can see the little difference if you actually stop and take a look at it
hum
that ' s why it fascinates me
but again you know i ' d like to be able to go ahead and take that someday and actually make a house of my own
well that ' s pretty neat though i mean i wish i had that much patience to sit down and do something tedious like that but
after a while it would just drive me nuts
well see you ' re doing the same thing when you ' re doing your gazebo you ' re playing with numbers
that ' s all this is you putting it on paper so you ' re just playing with numbers
yeah
it ' s like i would love to play with work but i don ' t have the strength in my hands
hum
anymore to do anything like that but i ' ve put up
like a wall board fixed a bedroom and put in a bath
i like i like i like building furniture probably the best that sort of thing
when i had the equipment and the place to set it up
i like
things that are difficult to do i like to see if i can do it
back when i was in college i took lots of wood courses and then i even did it after i was out of college i continued to do it and i built just about every stick of furniture in my house
everything from dining furniture to armoire to the whole nine yards
takes a long time to do all that stuff
yeah i have a small miter box for hobby mitering
um - hum
and it does the same thing what you ' re saying but i ' d like to which i ' ve been trying to find to go into as far as a permanent hobby which because i ' m having difficulties with this is to go into i ' m sure you ' ve seen it is those wood
oh they ' re wood pictures on the wall but if one move if one part moves it counterparts the other parts
and so like it ' s a continuous counterpart around it
and it ' s all made out of wood
hum
and i have as i said i have a miniature
miter box which is made for hobby works
and i ' ve had that for quite a few years now but i haven ' t really gone into that part i ' ve been thinking about making
oh ladders and everything for my pocket parrot because they ' re hard to find toys for a pocket parrot they make them for parrots and they make them for cockatiels and a pocket parrot ' s between the two
um - hum
and so i need rings that are exactly between those two sizes so i ' m going to i ' ve got some designs for i go into the pet stores but you can say again another hobby i ' ve got is my birds so
hum
birds
i have a cockatiel and a pocket parrot
oh those are interesting
but
other than that
see which ones talk do the do they talk
sam cockatiel talks he whistles at me and says good morning
he picked up most of his sayings from the other cockatiel i had the pocket parrot is a very quiet bird it ' s an extremely tame bird
it ' s if you ' re real gentle with it when you buy it it ' ll come out and sit on your shoulder with no problem
hum
yeah they ' re a very tender bird
about the only thing i had when i was growing up was probably a parakeet and canary
and we could let it out and fly around the house a little bit
and
oh they wouldn ' t really you know didn ' t really want you to pick them up per se but you know when i did they didn ' t they didn ' t give me a lot of trouble
well see when i was oh about i guess about ten years ago fifteen years ago
i don ' t know if it ' s been that long i took my dog my cat and my bird into the vet at the same time
and he was just sitting there he goes carol you ' re the only one i know of that does this and i go what ' s the problem because i never thought about it i had never thought one thing at all about it and of course the dog and the cat and the bird are all out of the cage
and my bird at that time was picking the feathers out from underneath his wing
and he finally said well you ought to get it a mate but the bird turned around and bit him he was furious he was so mad at me but yeah he had a picture of my birds
sitting on top of the cage with one tail inside of a front of a cat ' s face and the tail of another cat walking underneath the cage
so he just loved it he just absolutely adored it
that ' s unbelievable i would never have thought that you know that they would leave you alone without trying to attack each other
well the one large cat that i still have he took claw marks and put it down my drapes going after the birds sitting out on a
bird rack that we set up outside for birds
um - hum
going after the birds
and then he ' d get down and jump back up on the table and sit next to a cage that had two cockatiels out on top of the cage i ' d get so mad at that cat because i didn ' t realize what he was doing until i saw these big claw marks going down my
drapes from his back claws
yeah that nice expensive
yeah i didn ' t think i didn ' t appreciate it too much i mean it ' s rather i thought it was rather funny here ' s a bird doing this and two birds sitting right next to him but
i mean the birds were out they weren ' t in the cage they were out i never left them in so but i thought but i still have that cat in fact i have both cats which are my kids ' cats but the birds are in here with the cats they don ' t care
yeah
huh
they keep an eye on any cat that walks outside but they don ' t care about these cats
well they get used to each other
i don ' t know what it is i ' ve seen
guess they know they have to live together so they may as well make the best of it
i ' ve heard a lot of people that doesn ' t work that way
i get most of my news from newspapers really i read the daily newspaper the houston chronicle and sometimes i ' ll read like the
wall street journal or the new york times i don ' t subscribe to either but sometimes i get a hold of copies of it how about you do you mostly get news from tv or newspaper
however i do also watch television news usually in the morning once a day and i read the front page of the wall street journal most everyday
oh that ' s interesting you said computer networks what sort i ' m fairly knowledgeable about oh okay that ' s interesting
so it ' s no fee subscription i ' m very easy to read at my leisure and it ' s sorted by category for example so i can read certain businesses or topics
i ' ve never used the dow jones news wire
but yeah it do you do you get any do you read any news magazines or anything like that for sort of like a broader like more long term analytical sort of approach
but not like business week or news week or one of those kinds of things i i ' d like to say that however that i ' m overwhelmingly disappointed with the media in general except for the raw news wires
interesting in what way in like in sort of like a quality or sort of the orientation in terms of like view point or the way the news is presented or whatever
you well you won ' t offend me so go ahead and say
there ' s a strong there ' s a strong bias in the media
yeah like a liberal type of bias
yeah absolutely after all who writes are people are journalist who are trained to write and they ' re that ' s a liberal
yeah
yeah
yeah
an expert in i find their descriptions to be
wrong
yeah they generally make mistake on anything technical at least but
and
it
that ' s right well even if it ' s not technical if it ' s social thing or whatever it doesn ' t matter if i ' m expert in it they usually make mistakes which leads me to believe that the things i ' m not expert in that they ' re telling me lies
yeah
yeah do you by mistakes do you do you mean just like honest mistakes or do you think they ' re deliberate sorts of things
yeah
yeah
one event and describe another event but with the attempt to give you the impression that what they ' re talking about is the same thing that they ' re showing you
hm
which is sort of like a deliberate bias which is which is rather disturbing i know abc does that
hm that ' s disturbing
i haven ' t really noticed them doing that but
whatever again i don ' t watch tv news that much now if i had access to cnn i would watch tv news more i don ' t you know but i don ' t usually yeah
yeah i don ' t have access either although i did at one time and it i did during the gulf war and it was addictive
yeah did you did you think that cnn well the gulf war coverage would be kind of abnormality i just i guess
i ' d be curious to know what you thought as to as to how like say cnn tv news compared to the three networks
so interesting political trends or events huh
um - hum
caught his interview last night with david frost and it was the first time i had you know heard you know his views expressed by himself i had heard other people talk about what they thought he believed in
uh - huh
uh - huh
but the whole phenomena of him coming out of literally no where no party at least no apparent party support on either side
huh
yeah i have not even heard believe it or not of that person i ' m not kidding when you when you said it was kind of like a surprise
um - hum
like out of nowhere yeah
yeah i think mainly because i haven ' t been watching what ' s politically going on in that you know
um - hum
in that aspect as far as like now the new health bill that went through minnesota being that it is their neighboring state and that i lived in minnesota and more familiar with the politics that involved with that and that being passed
um - hum
but as far as politics in the grander
part of it as if you want to look at election type things i ' m not quite sure even if i ' m going to vote
um - hum yeah
it gets harder and harder each time an election comes up like that to make the decision on who would be the best to run
um - hum
um - hum
sure
exactly
the candidates are already beyond what most public feels is acceptable behavior
um - hum
you know the one of the common criticisms of clinton is gee he ' ll say or do anything in order to get to the white house and up unto the point of perot being a serious candidate it seems like that
sure
that was a requirement of being a contender within the party is to have done all those things
um - hum sure
i mean here ' s a here ' s a guy who for twenty years has been working toward you know getting the party nomination and preparing himself for the presidency
and now it seems like both he and the incumbent president are you know pretty seriously threatened by somebody who comes out of
a whole nonpolitical arena
he might be a one of those sure it it ' s kind of when you think back of the old politics where a dirt farmer
when you think of some of the best presidents we ' ve had in the past have been people that have struggled to get to the top i mean they were not rich in any means
um - hum
and it has been kind of in the past i don ' t know maybe fifty years that in order for a person to get involved with politics they ' ve had to have money
um - hum
and you had to have the views of the people that were going to be paying your way
um - hum
so it makes the common person not to say that a common person couldn ' t run for government and do a fabulous job because he ' s got people that are quite intelligent and
i don ' t know if we ' ll ever see that you know where a common person could ever get in there that has good moral standings and has
you know you think of abraham linking lincoln and you know just the background of abraham lincoln you know teaching himself to read he didn ' t go to college he didn ' t
um - hum
you know do all the other things that you know you would think that was real popular to do and to get politically involved and have money he didn ' t come from money
um - hum yeah
and yet even he was a consummate politician in the sense that not only did he fail in business twice with bankruptcy and failure but he lost some eighteen elections before he finally won one
and now it
um - hum sure
um - hum
and the first and only election he won was the presidency
so you really know a lot of his background
yeah then when then when he finally you know did win an election you know was the presidency yeah
it was the big one it ' s the one that everybody wants yeah whether or not you know you look at all these candidates that want to become president i really have to ask them why you know
but
yeah
it ' s the toughest job in the world to do and not only that you don ' t have that much freedom to make choices i mean you have to go through so many different you got to go through the house the congress and all of the a other things to get a bill passed
um - hum
um - hum
actually they just recently started a policy of testing drugs which was kind of interesting because when i went to work for them they didn ' t do that but since then they ' ve started a
drug testing policy not because of their own convictions but because the clients of our company are requesting that we do that
huh
how about you
no we ' re not being tested for drugs at all
our policies and procedures manual the furthest it goes about drugs is in the kind of the miscellaneous section or it ' s reasons for immediate dismissal it says use of narcotics on company premises
uh - huh
hum
okay
yeah
uh - huh
yeah
but i think it ' s got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have to exercise some quick judgment in the field what is the nature of your company ' s business
you know the engineers who go out there are adhering to their drug policy because they ' re on their you know territory and everything but
huh
the thing that ' s interesting is that i i ' m an engineer and a software engineer and i work in the software house and everybody there you know are all software engineers they ' ve never you know they never go out to the oil rigs or anything and
yet we ' re getting we ' re subjected to this policy you know the same one that all the engineers have to well a little different actually but you know we have to go through the same thing and it ' s
but it ' s a little different i guess than a lot of drug policies in our case it ' s like when you hire on they ' ll test you and then if you get injured on the job if you like trip and fall or something they give you a drug test right away
oh really
other than that they don ' t have random testing or anything like that but a lot of people were really upset with the policy at first particularly like we have a lot of parties and stuff where they serve alcohol and they didn ' t find any problem with that you know but
but you know they don ' t think twice about serving
beer by the keg you know but i think drug testing and i don ' t know
yeah
i guess i think it ' s got some relevance but i think its relevance is pretty limited i mean i think you know in your case i don ' t think that
you should necessarily be subjected to drug testing i think that ' s an interesting policy your company has about testing immediately after an on the job accident
yeah
yeah it ' s really it ' s really bizarre
and i don ' t know i ' m ambivalent about the whole thing i you know i have a lot of mixed feelings about on the one hand it ' s like if
you know they ' re they should be able to make it as a condition of employment in some sense and you know it ' s like you ' re i mean employments are contractual by nature anyway
um - hum
but
i had an experience when i was interviewing for a job that where i had to do a drug test and it ' s it was kind of a long story but it was it was just an incredibly humiliating experience what i went through and it amounted to
going in before any of these interviews i ' m not even working for this company i ' m going in for like interviews and they flew me out to chicago and before i went in to any of the interviews they took me to the doctor to give me a physical they said it was going to be a physical you know
and actually beforehand they told me they were going to do drug screening
how do you manage your budget
well let ' s see we or i sit down at the
in a on a monthly or a biweekly i get paid every two weeks so i make out a budget for every two weeks and
i sit down and see how much money i have to have for my bills going out
and then i compare that to how much money we need to make and
then just set it up that way and allot this much money for everything and if we have any left over we ' ll
you know buy clothes or have fun go out to eat or something
and we ' re going to try to start saving
as soon as we can
we generally don ' t have a lot left over but as far as the long term our long - term goal is to get out of debt
um - hum
and
most of our debts are from before we were married and we ' re trying to get rid of you know student loans those kinds of things
yeah
well i in my younger years i ' d always heard the adage you should buy as much of a house as you can afford
um - hum
because of the improvement in real estate prices
and on the last move we bought ourselves a fairly large house
and i ' ve got some pretty stiff mortgage payments now
yeah
and the
improvement in income and investments and so forth has not come at the rate i ' ve expected so we ' re still kind of hurting by the high mortgage payments and we haven ' t gotten out from under them yet
yeah
but
so far we ' ve managed to hold our own by
trying to set up a monthly budget
yeah
i try to take out just so much cash for me and my give so much cash to my wife
um - hum
to spend on groceries and clothing and fuel for the car
and then the rest of it ' s pretty much fixed expenses mortgage electricity
water and
and garbage collection and telephone bills and cable television bills
and those are pretty much fixed
yeah that ' s basically the kinds of bills we have are on our budget are you know the needs the have to haves and
you know those kinds of things we don ' t have a lot of
yeah
let ' s see my mother - in - law lives not too far from here so she helps with our son ' s clothes when she can
um - hum
and
that ' s real good and
at ti i have a real good benefits package for
you know like for going to the doctor and that kind of thing so that ' s not something i really have to put in the budget that seriously
so
yeah no my wife ' s pretty good about grocery shopping and
yeah
she pitches in and makes clothes for the kids
really well that ' s neat
which is a big help one of our big problems though is handling unexpected budget items
yeah
like this month the heat pump went out and
they want pretty close to three thousand dollars just to replace that
wow
so what do you do
well we have to cut into the savings at this point to buffer that
oh
wow
and
well that ' s good that you have the savings to get into
so it ' s the unexpected things that make it awful hard to control the budget
wow
yeah that ' s
that ' s the way we are we ' ve had a lot of unexpected things just in the last couple months
yeah
that really hit us hard but i ' ve been able to work enough overtime to you know really help with the with covering the expenses
so but we ' ve never been we ' ve been married for nearly four years and we ' ve never been able to save any money and i think it ' s just
hit both of us just in the past few months that we need to start saving some money no matter what we do we need to put that in our budget and just start doing it
yeah
even if it ' s you know ten dollars a week
and so we ' re going to start doing that or actually we started two paychecks ago
and that was i think that was a really wise decision
well do you have some savings plans at work
no actually i ' m not involved in anything like that at work or
anywhere i don ' t have anything to fall back on at all
yeah
and i know that ' s not wise but
that ' s just where we ' re at right now my wife just went back to work part - time she can substitute teach at schools
and there ' s so many school districts and schools here in the metroplex that by turning her name in if she wanted to she could work
yeah
you know everyday but
we ' re just going to let her work one maybe two days a week and we ' re just going to apply all the money that she makes to
our debts and try to get as much out of debt as fast as we can
yeah
um - hum
and there ' s and we ' re christians and that ' s we ' ve only been christians for about five years but that ' s a real a biblical truth in the bible is to
to not be in debt and we ' re really starting to see the reasoning behind that
um - hum
and because we ' re you know we ' re always well i can ' t be sick this week but one day
yeah
or you know this month but one day because you know our bills will catch up with us if i am
or you know i we can ' t go on a two week vacation because
i wouldn ' t make any overtime in two weeks so that would really hurt us financially and you know just things like that all the time and you know we really see how we ' re
um - hum
you know indebted or nearly underneath the debt that we have
yeah
you know and that ' s really hard but
so far we ' ve never really been behind on any bills
i had to put our student loans on hold once for about i think three months
um - hum
and we had a cutback at work
and this is this was a couple of years back
but anyway but we ' re doing really good we ' re not saving but we ' re staying right even
yeah we ' ve been looking around at
trying to develop some side activities that might help out such as creating some craft objects that we can market in the local stores
oh yeah
or
making some dresses for children or things like that or even writing children ' s books
yeah that ' s neat
oh that ' s neat yeah
and
i tried this past year writing journal articles but i found out it cost me more than the honorariums i got for writing them
wow
oh wow because of the time
well especially the first one because i wound up buying a lot of reprints for handouts and i ate up all my profits with
wow
right
buying reprints
right
wow
yeah my wife made a whole lot of crafts last year for christmas presents
um - hum
and we didn ' t
you know have to allot any well hardly very much money anyway for christmas just for our personal family just me and her and our son and
i think her mom and that was really you know about it we made everything else that we gave for christmas last year
um - hum
yeah
and she did really good with that
oh we thought we were going to be pretty tight with christmas this past year
um - hum
but we have a family dog that ate all of the children ' s toys
oh wow
wow
oh no
and get them a whole new set of playthings
wow
that ' s funny well anyway what is the economy doing pretty good there where you ' re at
so far it ' s doing fairly well we ' re in the metropolitan washington area
and i guess most of the area is still living off the federal government with
beltway bandit type contracts
our company is done fairly well
um - hum
and
yeah what company is it
i ' m with the melpar division of e - systems
oh of e - systems okay
yeah
i see what do you all make
we ' re primarily in the systems integrations business
um - hum
well my parents are both in their seventies my mother and stepfather and my father and stepmother are all in their seventies and my
father and stepmother are not in very good health so this is
it ' s a concern of yours right now is
yes it is
are they living independently right now
yes they are they are
oh have you looked at any homes for them or talked to them about that
not for them my mother and stepfather have
set up an arrangement where they have a large home and two of my sisters
and their families one of them husband and then all the children are living in this home its got a lot of bedrooms and bathrooms and they all share the same kitchen and dining room and den and kitchen and my father bought this
my stepfather bought this thinking of a time when one or the other of them might need care and they felt like that would be their alternative to a nursing home
oh that sounds like the ultimate
unless they were so ill that they needed nursing care that could not be given in the home
well even at that point most care can be given at in the home that sound like just an excellent solution you must feel real good about that
um - hum
well i felt good about it because that ' s my personal feeling also i
i read a lot and then i know people that then have visited nursing homes and
have had great grandparents in the nursing homes and it was not a happy situation for
for any of them and
we have a very active nursing home here in plano that has activities going all the time and they have
um - hum
go and participate in olympics and they make their crafts and sell them at a big fair that ' s held annually at a big mall here
right
you know so there are a lot of a lot of activities going on all the time and this is a nursing home it ' s not a senior citizens home so that the people are really
really in need of a nursing staff right uh - huh
right they need the nursing care and but it ' s a very expensive solution
you know listen to is the fact that there are good solutions both inside and outside of nursing homes it ' s just a matter of
finding a good home and then of course there is always the problem of being able to able to afford either of those solutions
right
right
right
and that i think is what is scary and i also feel that that ' s where some of the bad images of nursing homes come from is when people have to put people in a nursing homes and they really can not afford the best
right and that ' s right i well i took my husband one night to an emergency room when he was in an emergency situation and they brought in a very elderly man from a nursing home
who had apparently inhaled some chicken he was eating and he had apparently had not been in the home too long just a week or so but when they the family came in to see him
oh
they had not been made aware i was in the room when the emergency technicians brought him in from the ambulance and i overheard their conversation and when the family walked in his wife and daughter and son - in - law they were not even aware of what had happened
oh goodness
so i told them he strangled on some chicken
and they said the woman the wife said he was not even supposed to be eating any food like that would require chewing or
oh
so you know and i thought
what a shame they put him in the home so that he could be cared for
and then they could have done that well at home
and then she was upset he had on two different shoes one of which was not even his he had on a pair of slacks and the wife said these are not his slacks and she said i just took two pair over yesterday for him
oh
that clean and
you hear these stories all the time
right well i this was just
something that i was i witnessed to and at no point did anybody from the nursing home come in and we were there in the same room with the man for a half hour
you happened
right
oh
and with just a curtain of course between us and
right
they the revived the man and cleared out his airway and so forth and he was definitely just by looking at him and the way he acted you could tell he was in need of
of nursing home care but the family were all talking about
putting him in another home they said he will not go back
well good i ' m glad they have a solution
to that one
i ' m glad they the option
to do that yes i know
i would hate to be in a position where
that was all i could afford and there weren ' t there was no choice
exactly my
oh my
it ' s just her condition deteriorated instantly upon getting into that home as the situation is so
sad because
it just takes all the dignity away from
um - hum
from people who have been independent all their lives this was a really neat vital woman
and you get in a nursing home and the first thing that happens you have to share your whole living space with someone that you have never known before in your life
right
right
and oh i
i do not know what the answer is but i do know that there are some wonderful places out there and
it i think it does a lot of it goes down to just money
that ' s right
and family support if you know have family that you can live with right
um - hum
visits everyday or right
right
i really i think the way of selecting a nursing home would be similar to the way you would select child care
you know you ' d do your research and you would go visit
visit right
and hopefully they would have they would have it so that you could go there anytime
right
because if you could not go there anytime then that would make you a little bit right
suspicious
i guess there was not a name for what she had at that time but i guess alzheimer ' s would come as close as anything she really was not aware of what she was doing
um - hum
and
my name is ferrell
are you
where are you calling from
i ' m calling from miami
miami i ' m in utah
utah well we ' ve got a long distance connection tonight
yeah
yes it is definitely
you ready to start i am
sure go ahead
uh - huh
she has told me some horror stories but other than that i was thinking about the fact that so many kids nowadays can ' t even identify on the map on a globe where they are
uh - huh
and it ' s just astounding to me
yeah
i have a little bit of a background well my wife taught school for about six years
and i ' m almost convinced there ' s a lot of it has to do with environment
she taught in a poor area poor area here in utah and they recently did a big article in the local paper about the s a t scores
in all the districts of the state
yeah
and
the district we ' re presently living in had like double the scores where she taught and it wasn ' t because she was a bad teacher or the teachers there were bad i think a lot of it has to do with the environment and the help the kids get from home
the children get at home on education because this friend of mine who ' s a school teacher was telling me she said you know
that she has kids that are indian and pakistani oriental you know some of them who have only been in the united states maybe for two generations
uh - huh
yeah
uh - huh
that she said their english is excellent their social skills are good and you know why is it that they can be such model citizens and yet
uh - huh
you know other young kids who have you know been born and bred here in the us just don ' t seem to get it
uh - huh
yeah well you know you see these documentaries on japan for example and the rigors they put their students through i mean their high school students are going six days a week
right
to get into college is no small feat there i mean just to be accepted i ' m sure there are other countries that put a little more pressure on their on their children than we do
yeah i ' m beginning to wonder if maybe year round school would not be a bad a bad thing
yeah
in essence they have what they call tracks and you know the kids go year round
but you have you go like for eleven weeks and you ' re off for two or three then you go eleven weeks and so you have these four periods rather than the classic summer vacation
yeah
these are just mostly the elementary grades however
i don ' t certainly don ' t have the answer to it i know that in houston for example where i ' m i have some friends who
uh - huh
were telling me that they have the option there of selecting the school that they want their kids to go to
oh
and
regardless of where they live huh
oh
sort of like a business in a way such that if enough people are interested in sending their children there it gets more funding and those schools that are less successful less successful get less money
oh that ' s interesting it ' s kind of like turning it over to the private sector to some degree
yeah the
uh - huh
uh - huh
that ' s an interesting concept
but i don ' t know if that ' s the answer but i do think that there needs to be some changes made somewhere along the way
oh it ' s a nightmare
i can ' t believe it you
well and the very idea that anyone could graduate from high school and not and not know how to read or write
uh - huh
it ' s scary
yeah their awareness of the of the current events and geography like you were mentioned early
it ' s hard to me to imagine that somebody ' s going to overwrite what was the largest amount of checks and write out a check for five thousand dollars and not know they ' re overdrawing their account
yeah
but on the other hand somebody you know making a couple of overdrawing checks probably isn ' t a major phenomena i think they ' re under a lot of pressure especially when there ' s lots of money involved
and it ' s hard to keep them honest when they ' re there for a long time
oh i think so too and i think that ' s about the only thing you can do to clean up government or clean up the political side of government is to kick the bums out periodically limit the terms
well that bothers me because again we ought to have a government where we can choose who we want and when you know limit terms and you say well even if people want this person they can ' t have them
which is kind of a hard situation too
yeah but
have you been to washington
yes
have you watched those folks in action i mean i visited the house and the senate and sat there in the gallery and watched those folks up there pontificating to a room full of no one
yeah
i don ' t know i it it ' s like their not in the real world or something and maybe that ' s why they have
have trouble drawing lines as to what ' s illegal and what ' s not
well i mean the other problem is that they ' re always up for reelection
sure
so that they ' re always not making the right decision but the politically correct decision
yeah
and it i think that ' s hard for them
plus when you put the lobbyist back there i wish somehow we could limit lobbyist
well
i think that ' s a greater problem because they ' re constantly trying to
use their influence in not always the most positive ways
yes that ' s true i think they do things that make it easier for our elected representatives to live the good life
yeah
no
it ' s almost like they ' re royalty of some sort and i think that ' s why they forget sometimes that laws apply to them too
seems to me somehow if they could draw a straight salary and not have any other benefits
and you know i don ' t know what the salary ought to be but i think that would decrease somewhat the need for the kinds of things that sometimes happen
yeah but aren ' t they making something like a hundred and ten thousand a year
well i was shocked i was happened to be reading the voters guide in the last election and a representative makes a hundred and twenty nine thousand dollars a year
that ' s
no thanks
yeah i what gets me is when they pass laws and they always manage to exempt themselves from them
or they give themselves raises when they ' re trying to cut government expenses
oh yes but i mean is it no wonder that there ' s not a balanced budget when they can ' t even handle their own checking accounts
yeah
i don ' t know
and the other problem is you know one of the other questions it asked is there someway we can make all unethical things illegal and i ' m just convinced you can ' t legislate common sense
no probably not
and that seems to be something that a lot of them are missing
that ' s right i they get caught up i think in the
the glamour and the power and whatnot and probably make bad decisions bad choices sometimes
and i think part of the other problem is because government has such a bad reputation people who might really do well in it
tend to avoid it
because of all the negative
feelings about politicians you may have some people who could be do a really good job but they just kind of stay out of it because they don ' t want
to be associated with that kind of thing
that ' s true
i think he ' s an honest person
yeah i think he definitely is
i don ' t
and he and he certainly has no need to have his hands in anybody else ' s pockets
shall
actually i ' ve had i ' ve had very good luck on consumer products lately
um - hum
gotten recently it ' s been a new mother board for my computer and that ' s working fine
a new motherboard
yeah
okay
because my other one bit the dust after a power failure
yeah
so i got a you know a very inexpensive motherboard from someone in california very happy we were very fast
uh - huh
oh yeah
how about you
i ' m not buying much in terms of consumer products these days
i prefer to travel rather than buy things so
yeah i hear you there the i guess you know given a choice most people are kind of holding off on
right
getting anything i ' m trying to think back in mind if there ' s ever been anything i got
you know the things i ' ve been most disappointed with is that when you go those time share gimmicks
exactly yes
right or from the sidewalk vendors that are supposed to be the real thing
right you know i find there ' s that you just have to be really careful
because like especially if you watch tv there ' s like all such of scams going on where you know like you really have to listen to what they ' re selling you i mean there ' s a lot of things like
oh
god you like you know yes you can get whole sacks of beef you know delivered fresh to you if you buy our thousand dollar refrigerator
uh - huh
or
you know all these multilevel marketing things
you know
right
right
i mean if you use the coupon you ' re just falling for the gimmick and there you are
uh - huh
oh that ' s right that ' s right
i really think multilevel marketing is undermining
the quality of american business because people getting so focused on the progress other than the products
uh - huh
you know it ' s like well you know i could get two hundred distributors on to me each selling one dollar a week and i ' ll be rich but
yeah
oh all those pyramid schemes
yeah
you know amway and al williams insurance which i guess is primerica now
and
right and
even somewhat is mary kay you know she ' s a local girl
mary kay you know they they ' re something
yeah oh we have dallas to blame for mary kay
but yeah i find that you know the place where i think the one place were we you know consumer price i did fairly well i was leading electronics industry
yeah except that i was with a friend yesterday we had his macintosh
um - hum
and he had taken it back to the store for repair
yeah
too expensive in my opinion but
well whatever but it ' s what he wants because he ' s an animator
right
and he ' s using all of those tools and he ' s having a really difficult time with the hardware
oh no not that
oh yeah
um - hum
and you know i typically when your vcr breaks what you have to do you have to like give it to these guys for weeks
right
and then eventually they ' ll get it back to you but i happen to know this guy who i met recently he just like took it down to his basement popped off the cover you know took a couple of things off so okay this is just junked up cleaned it out it ' s working fine didn ' t charge me anything
you know i think that the really where the american consumer products kind of failing is in the customer service
oh exactly and you know
there was no reason that mike should have had to pay forty five dollars for somebody to run a diagnostic that he had already run
okay so are you a fisherman
a little bit i have not have not done a lot of fishing in the last couple of years anyway but i like to fish so i i ' ve i take fishing magazines and read and watch fishing tv shows
yeah
yeah
are old enough to play summer baseball and fall league basketball and that kind of stuff and man i just don ' t have the time to go like i want to
yeah well mine are kids are both grown so that ' s past the point now where i can use them as an excuse but
oh really
working and doing things around the house you know keeps you pretty busy anyway so
yeah
i tell you it really is hard to get time to go fishing you know unless you just
yeah
really work at it almost it ' s almost like a second job
yeah what
yeah when you do fish do you fish for bass or just
yeah i ' m i like to go after them big old black bass
yeah
go after the big ones yeah where have you fished recently
oh i got a few little old ponds up around here you know there ' s several around here just i do a lot of oh just small farm fishing and i mean small farm tank fishing and you know rock pit fishing but i ' ve been to
yeah
oh the last i guess the last big lake i went to was lake fork
yeah i have not made it to lake fork yet although i ' ve talked about it and
i ' ve got i ' m a cpa and i ' ve got clients that or a client that lives on lake tawakoni
um - hum
that has told me you know anytime i wanna fish you know just come on over
yes
oh are you
yeah it ' s
you know i can go fishing just about anywhere i want to go but it ' s a matter of finding the time you know
yeah that is a problem
just you know whatever you know whatever will bite i ' ll fish for and my brother - in - law likes to fish for crappie
yeah
and so i fish a bit with him you know fishing for those and then you know i fish for bass fish but basically like i said fish for what whatever i can catch
uh - huh
yeah
i don ' t know enough about fishing to you know to say i ' m going to go after a particular kind so
yeah
that seems to be what the bass like and what you can catch with the lures so that ' s generally what i fish for you know because i don ' t particularly like to eat fish i just like to catch them and throw them back
yeah
yeah
um - hum
used to go around a lot use that a lot but
like i say i kind of got out of the fishing business when the kids got up big enough so i got sold that and
yeah
but it ' s
yeah so are you a
well as a matter of fact last fall in
october i guess i bought i bought a boat but i bought a ski boat
gonna keep it
yeah you can it ' s not the same as a bass boat but yeah you can get out on the water that ' s the main thing
uh - huh
yeah that ' s
but i used to go with a friend at work quite a bit he had he had a bass boat and he ' s the one i went to
oh like i say we went to lake fork and cypress springs and we ' ve been to lavon and texoma just
yeah
right on
yeah
we kind of grounded ourselves in that respect
yeah well the last time i had anticipated fishing i thought i might fish at lake texoma i was going up there with a group
uh - huh
and
when i got there discovered you have to have a special license to fish on the lake right
yeah that ' s well you don ' t have to but it makes it easier you got to have well if you have a texoma license you can fish anywhere on the lake
yeah
if you have only a texas license you have to stay on the texas side of the lake which as it turns out most of the lake is in oklahoma
yeah well that ' s what i understood anyway i discovered it was much better to have texoma license
yeah
and i didn ' t have that so i said well i wasn ' t going to that plus there wasn ' t anybody else fishing you know in the group so i said well i just won ' t worry about it
yeah
yeah
and that was probably the last time i even tried to fish and or even thought about it but
yeah
i ' ve got my fishing tackle in the trunk of my car so if the urge ever
ever bites you know i ' m kind of available but
go across the bridge across the water if it looks good you can just pullover and start it then
yeah right
yeah now i ' ve got most of mine hung up in the garage now like i say it ' s been a while since i ' ve
but
since i ' ve even gotten to go
pretty days
like today like this weekend of course it ' s too windy now but you know it usually dies down around sundown i ' ve got a little old pond just
yeah
oh just a few hundred yards from my back door that i go over there occasionally but
yeah
you know it ' s pretty small and got pretty small fish in it but
yeah
it ' s nice to get out and just start splashing on the water or something
yeah
but do you read anything about fishing do you have any books or magazines or anything that you take that you
no i don ' t take any magazines but i like to watch old berry stokes
yeah well i enjoy him too yeah but
yeah he ' s about my favorite
yeah i watch i take have just started taking the that bass joined the bass anglers club you know and get their magazine
and then i take the texas fisherman
oh really
yeah
and you know i find those to be pretty good they the texas fisherman they do cover a pretty broad range of fishing but they cover a lot spend a lot of time on salt water you know
yeah that ' s yeah i have taken some fishing magazines in the past and that ' s generally what i found that seemed like they spend a lot of time
along the coast
yeah
uh - huh
discussing the type fishing that i wasn ' t really interested in
yeah and then of course i guess the bass you know the bass anglers book is covers the pretty well covers the country
yeah
so you don ' t get a lot of texas you know in particular coverage in that but
yeah
yeah it ' s really more kind of all over the south isn ' t it
still you get some pretty good tips
yeah
i believe so it ' s their headquarters are in alabama so
yeah what do you get when you when you join the b a s what kind of benefits to you get
yeah
yeah
but then they they ' re always i just joined just signed up for the magazine here a month or so ago but they you know they send you offers and things
um - hum
yeah
lure packages and things like that you can
yeah tackle and stuff
if you matter of fact if you get other people to sign up you know that to sign up for the thing you know
uh - huh
then you get lure packages or pocket knives or things like that but
yeah
but they ' ve got i think they might even have a visa card or something that they promote you know through the club and
yeah
they ' ve got discounts on travel rental cars and things like that
yeah
yeah
right
yeah i ' ve noticed they they ' re now
pushing a mastercard that you know they ' re supposed to spend so much of the money on conservation measures and stuff
yeah
which is a good idea i guess
yeah it ' s a good idea i think i think we need to we need to do a lot more on the conservation than you know
oh yeah
yeah especially as popular as fishing is getting you know in the last few years last five or ten years i guess it ' s really picked up in popularity again
yeah
so it ' s a lot more
you know a lot more people using the lakes and facilities and putting more pressure on the fish and taking more fish out of the lakes
yeah so you haven ' t fished joe pool lake down here yet i guess or what ' s the other one ray roberts is that
no i haven ' t
yeah now ray roberts i haven ' t been over there but i ' ve i understand there ' s quite a few people who have been i think that ' s really going to be a good bass lake
yeah
yeah
yeah but yeah i joe pool is so close you know close into dallas it ' s a little bit of a drive from richardson
yeah
to get down there but i ' ve got a couple of clients that are down in that area
uh - huh
i just i just i thought that it might be convenient for me sometime to just
like i said just pull over and fish a while
yeah
if i can find a place to get to the water somehow
yeah i understand it ' s kind of kind of restricted or doesn ' t have easy access really
yeah
so you have to find a spot
which is a yeah which is all right you know that that ' s all you can do that ' s all you can do but
yeah
yeah
it ' s good to get out there and like i say throw the lure out and just
just piddle with it a little while
yeah
yeah some of them it takes a little while to get them to do what you think they ought to be done
yeah
using a jig and pig i think is the term does that mean that they
uh - huh yeah
like they use just it ' s like a hook with a little head on it and then just tie a piece of rubber pork type stuff on the hook itself
yeah yes it ' s just that pork skin
which you know you can get the artificial pork or you can use the real slab of pork but yeah that ' s what it is it just
um - hum
but it ' s just hung on the hook
yeah uh - huh
yeah huh
that ' s what is amazing you know all these different rigs that people come up with you know the carolina worm rig and the like i said the jig and pig but
hi
you don ' t at all
no and unfortunately it shows i
i ' m supposed to i ' m way overweight
but i ' ve had a problem with high blood pressure which of course is directly connected to it and my doctor is trying to get my blood pressure under control
um - hum
before i start in any exercising
or too much of it yeah you need
so anyway i did join the
the texans
up at
oh uh - huh
springcreek
um - hum
and i ' ve been up there a few times
but didn ' t accomplish too much because i just run down too quick
yeah i haven ' t been up there but i understand they ' ve got a nice pool and that ' s my favorite form of exercise is swimming
that would have to be mine i hate exercising it ' s so boring
i would much prefer to like walk through the woods
oh yeah most of my forms of exercise come in the form of a five year old and a two year old
uh - huh
and running after them or going biking with them or just exploring you know on a little exploration hike you know through the neighborhood it ' s amazing you know how many earthworms you can find and
and to a five year old they ' re they never get old you know an earthworm every single time she finds one it ' s a brand new exciting activity for her
isn ' t it amazing
um - hum it really is
well we
back when my i have four sons they ' re all grown now and two of them are married with children of their own but
when they were just pre teenagers we
um - hum
we decided the only way we could afford vacations is to go camping
oh yeah isn ' t it great
and we thoroughly enjoyed it i mean we went whole hog we had the tents and everything else and pretty much roughed it
sleeping on the ground and all
um - hum
and i like to think that my children my sons learned a lot about the outdoors
being self - sustaining
um - hum
i would have no doubt what so ever that any one of them could be dropped in the middle of no where and they ' d
exist somehow
well that ' s neat my husband was a boy scout and he actually went very far in the boy scouts and he was in the order of the arrow and he absolutely
you know the earth is part of him
and he is part of it and i think that ' s a real important thing and we enjoy going camping we haven ' t yet had them sleeping on the ground primarily because
to them or to the five year old the two year old would freak out about it but she wouldn ' t quite get totally unnerved but the five year old still has a fear of spiders
oh uh - huh okay that is understandable
oh yes i ' m very familiar with it very beautiful place
isn ' t that a beautiful place
i ' ve been up there several times
well it was up there actually that she got her fear of spiders because we sat and watched a tarantula for a long time we you know we ' d never seen one
oh what a shame
so we weren ' t concerned about it and we just sat and watched it and we explained you know how it did well that night she had a nightmare and she has been terrified of spiders since
but we still go up there and we still have a great time
well good i ' m glad to hear that about the only thing i might suggest is
do the same thing again introduce her to a to a spider at a reasonable distance where she isn ' t frightened
um - hum
and that the nightmare i ' m sure was just a freak
i ' ll bet it wouldn ' t happen again
i think not i think it was you know being in a new place being kind of out of out of sorts and everything all combined but
sure
both of us would love to exercise on a routine basis but our life doesn ' t really have that much time in it so we just enjoy what we can along with our family you know
with your family
well
yeah we have a
and you ' re certainly all getting an education while you ' re
doing this exercise
that ' s kind of how we feel about it we can ' t you know there ' s
as far as we ' re concerned
um - hum
and we really have a great time with it i ' m sure that ' s the way that you felt with your boys
oh definitely it was a learning experience
now we i guess we camped just about every public campground in the state of florida
oh yes yell they used to be but now they ' re trying to really
put it to the
visitors i think they ' re doing a very stupid thing
oh with walt disney world and
well they charge extra now they there was a time here a few years ago when they put an extra tax on all the campgrounds and the motels and hotels
so they are you know really putting it to the visitors and people got a little fed up with it and they and suddenly the foundling fathers of florida found out that they were losing beaucoup bucks
people were going elsewhere for their vacations
by night
they were trying to turn it too much into a business
exactly so they got rid of that tax in a hurry
i can appreciate that
gone down to the new braunfels san well we were headed down to sea world in san antonio
um - hum
and we stopped along the way and enjoyed ourselves along the way but you know that ' s pretty much as far as we ' ve tried with little ones
well the trick is to stop frequently and let the kids get out and run
um - hum
now i ' m alone now myself and i
i have graduated from sleeping on the ground to going in a motor home
oh um - hum
well the fact i live in it and there ' s just my dog and i now my dog is a wonderful traveler but i do have to stop for her quite frequently
um - hum
and it works out fine i mean i stop i ' m never in a hurry to get anywhere
and no reason to be
like
it takes me two days to get to memphis
no it ' s about an eight or nine hour drive really
yeah
but i make it in two days because i don ' t push it
oh definitely oh absolutely incidentally oh i can ' t remember the name of that place there ' s a beautiful park up there
and they do have a oh sort of a hotel a lodge a lodge that ' s what it is
um - hum
um - hum
and it ' s just off the interstate and the kids would love it because they have playgrounds for the children and all and they have a several nature trails
it ' s just off the interstate that goes through hot springs
it ' s just below hot springs
okay
oh
well that wouldn ' t even be a very far drive
it ' s lake something
i ' m not i ought to look into it because we were kind of
entertaining the thought of taking a you know like just a five or six day trip in the not too distant future to kind of kick off the summer
um - hum
and i
well the next time you go across the state line or when you come back in be sure and stop at one of the texas
uh - huh
welcome bureaus
um - hum
and ask them for their literature on the state national parks in the state of texas
um - hum
i probably wouldn ' t and i ' ve lived here all of my life
well it there are so many for have you ever been out to tyler state park
oh yes i have i have been to tyler that was one place we went when i was a child
all right you
we ' ve not taken our children though
there ' s a place to take them and
oh good heavens up there just this side of texoma not texoma texarkana
uh - huh
texarkana uh - huh
there are three or four state parks up there
we ought to head out
we
and they ' re all great and again there ' s the
nature trails
um - hum ah
for your exercising
right
we almost forgot our subject of the day there
but be sure and stop at one of those texas tourist bureaus and get their literature
yeah
yeah well i certainly will
jack it ' s been real it ' s been real informative for me to talk with you and i certainly enjoyed it
well it ' s been my pleasure gina is that with a g
okay
all right what did you look for when you were looking for child care
well we needed you know something that was kind of convenient to
to getting you know because usually in the mornings things are pretty rushed
so that was a consideration
my wife and her mother went over to the
to the lady ' s house who keeps helen
and they you know before took her actually took her over but before
we signed up for it and
just kind of looked around you know and talked to her for awhile
watch how all the children the other children interacted with her and they all seemed to like her so we
we went with her and we ' ve been we ' ve been really happy with her
i guess that ' s an important
i haven ' t thought about that as much as i
it
day school
uh - huh yeah
so they ' re kids before they went to school and
well what we had done was talk to the parents of the kids that were there
and all the parents were very enthusiastic so we thought well that ' s a that ' s a good point and then we visited once and seemed like they were pretty
but i guess there is a difference between
day care for kids that are
couple years away from school and
child care for now you and your wife both work right
um - hum yeah
so
when like when helen gets
a little closer to starting kindergarten that she ' d be you know put into a regular
day care so that they can they can learn more
like the alphabet and the numbers and all that stuff although she ' s really good she
she makes little like handprints
you know helen ' s hand and then puts little designs on them you know and you know so she takes a pretty active role and
our little girl she was premature and so she had she was on a monitor
heart monitor and that was no problem you know with the with the babysitter she you know took it right in stride
uh - huh
she
i guess with the right person if as opposed to some of these day care centers where they have
um - hum
to rely on
it ' s much easier to rely on one person if they ' re good they ' re good and if they ' re bad well you know
yeah that ' s the finding a good one that ' s the hard part
i think you probably have a better
chance with a day care they ' re probably
it ' s more of an average so that there ' s less chance of having a bad one yeah
well on the average on the well on the average they might do
gosh how should i say this
you ' re going for the average the average kid is going to be treated better but
yeah
but you won ' t have the
you won ' t have the risk of getting a real bad one everybody knows that they ' ve got a bad one on the other hand that ' s with a person who ' s taking care of them in their own home that ' s
yeah
if they ' re good like i say you can be pretty sure that they ' re good and so i if they ' re not so good if they ' re kind of lazy why the kid ' s probably
yeah
could tell you i personally would rather have my kids
stay with
you know with an individual than i would with a school because with a school if they lose if they have two or three good people and they lose one you ' ll never know it you just pick your kid up from school and
yeah
and see the other question i had is
so do you plan on keeping her in day care until she goes to school
i think well i think we ' re going to keep her where she ' s at now until she ' s about three and a half or four and then move her into a regular day care
that has more children
and also where they have like the pre kindergarten
type of environment
does this lady have any help or does she do it all herself
she has like occasional help that comes in
personal computers are nice i guess if you can afford them the problem if you happen to use one at work is you tend to get spoiled with the
maybe a higher grade one maybe the economics and the payback of having one at a business is a little bit better than having one at home and i ' ve read a few articles that
where people have nice three eighty six machines and nice graphics and the nice software packages and then when they come home they just can ' t stand to come down to the x t level and don ' t like the
the slowness or the in some cases not even having a hard drive and that ' s pretty much where i fall into i use a relatively nice array of machines at work for scientific purposes and i have
a variety of speeds and complexity of machines depending upon the instrument that it ' s controlling
and then i have one that i do just general purpose work on and then for the house i don ' t have anything not that i wouldn ' t want one but i
would probably not be satisfied with anything less than a really nice one and that ' s a quite an expense and then all the software tends to be
commercial grade it ' s all where i guess you know to get something like wordperfect you ' re looking at five hundred dollars worth or so
and some of the accounting packages or the nicer spreadsheets are somewhat expensive and i don ' t know it ' s quite a
expense or a luxury for the house i guess and there ' s not a whole lot i would do other than some word processing i got a
a number of things that i could be doing on a pc instead of here instead of doing them at the at work they ' re for the house but i do them on occasion at work and it ' s nice to it would be nice to have one i guess what do you think
i share your sense when you change job to work or job to home the way your image of the machine changes i tend to do slightly different things at home than i do at work
i use one two three a lot the lotus product as a spreadsheet and i have i use a
uh - huh
what you see is what you get editor for almost all of my word processing so i have not although i have access at home to things like works and wordperfect
but i do obviously notice it i think the thing that surprises me most when i change work to home environment is the cursor speed and after i if initially get over the cursor speed in the sense of moving linearly across the screen
as opposed to tabbing
uh - huh
i ' m a touch typer and i haven ' t ever really noticed
differences the machine tends to react as fast as i can i use an as a matter of fact use an eighty eight at home which is really old iron
probably ten years or so and at the office i am indeed using a three eighty six
i use a pc for a great deal of things in private life i ' m a church treasurer
and i use the machine a lot on a data base and financial package that operates at the church office i do some volunteer work at home using
a buttons pc file program that is a very simplistic relational data base for labels and things so i guess i would have to say on a home setting i ' m probably on
the personal computer as much as an hour a day on average at home
well that ' s good
i don ' t have
a concern too much about the speed however because most of the applications i find are as fast as i am if not more so and i tend to notice it more when it
comes down to an issue of peripherals at work i ' m used to various batch printing capabilities and pretty high - speed output either laser printer
uh - huh
or machines like ibm thirty eight twenty high speed
apa printers and so i get frustrated watching things slowly come out upon my matrix printer more so than i do over access speed
i
guess that i have gotten to the point where if i didn ' t have the personal computer
i would be impacted a great deal on the things that i do in my life i ' m sure i would probably find ways to return to what i was doing in nineteen eighty one when i
got my first home computer but it would be i think a dramatic sense of loss on some items
on your editor do you do does it do spell correcting or any kind of thesaurus work
no i have access to spell correction material i
i seldom use it although when i ' m at the office and i ' m producing work correspondence i run about ninety per cent of my office work on a mainframe
uh - huh
i execute on a three eighty six machine that is attached to the mainframe as a as a intelligent work station but i use it
uh - huh
frequently as a dumbhead to get to the mainframe and there i tend on almost all of my editing and stuff to be using some fairly powerful
right
editors and word processors and wordproof but surprisingly at home and i seldom ever bother or worry about it too much
i guess ultimately i ' m not a horribly bad speller although i have a tendency to lisp when i type so to speak
nothing that that ' s particularly horrible and i think most of the work word processing i do since it ' s somewhat of a personal nature i ' ve probably don ' t have a sense of vulnerability
in this in the even that i were to send a misspelled word out the way one might have at the office place
right
well i tend to that ' s one thing i notice the speed difference in when i have a darc document that ' s maybe twenty or thirty pages long and i want to
search through it for the spelling it takes forever on an old x t at four point seven megahertz you know the old ones and we ' re looking at
several minutes worth of time for it to go through and check everything as opposed to a three eighty six where i can just you know it flashes through there and then even just file copying i do some of that every once in awhile and
okay
and little things like that i i ' ve noticed the speed difference in and i do some graphics i haven ' t done any well i ' ve done a little bit for the for the house at work but if i were to bring it home
or have a machine at home i would like to be able to put together small brochure type things with the front page being a little bit of graphics and the inside being printed in a
what i would call a booklet form there are some editors that will produce the you know print it sideways and collate it in such a way that this page comes out right so that you can fold all these eight and a half by elevens and make a little booklet and
right
my i ' ve done that on occasion at work and my wife does some teaching you know little bitty weekend type teaching for some women in the area and
and she likes to work up little outlines and things in this format and so i do all the work for her at work and it would really be nice to be able to do it here and say is this what you want you know instead of going back and forth every day it takes us a little while to get it right
but i don ' t know maybe someday we ' ll get around to getting something decent
that ' s
that ' s an interesting point i think a the more i as i ' ve thought about
to bring home
our conversation i realize that one of the things that perhaps causes me not to get a jarring difference between the two locations is that at the office i ' m doing work things that in some ways are dissimilar from what i do at home
and as a result i don ' t get the comparative feel
i suspect if i were coming home and trying to do some of the projects i do at the office i would go crazy on my on my machine i haven ' t tended to play the games and do the applications at work that i do at home so i probably have never been in
right
noticed how wonderful it might be i suspect lotus one two three and spreadsheet application might be the one common thread
and there i think that even though i ' m on an eighty eight at home
that the speed is really quite adequate and i consequently don ' t even really notice the difference between the fast machine and the eighty eight
uh - huh
yeah unless they ' re tremendously large they ' re not going to make that much difference
right i do have some retirement modeling that i ' ve done at home that tends to crawl which on which i ' ve just turned the calculation off in between and a couple of models that i ' ve
uh - huh
built for school purposes that i start in the evening and then go to bed and get them the next morning but they would have run an hour and a half even on a thirty three eighty six machine i imagine so
i suspect that what happens is that you get to the point where it ' s so long that from a human being perspective there ' s not much difference between six hours and an hour and a half
uh - huh
uh - huh
some of the some of the good obviously that nobody has to worry about health care
right
so it ' s a very it ' s a very comfortable i mean our people are very comfortable in the sense that you know there ' s no medical emergency that ' s going to make you destitute for life
right
the bad was more apparent i think at least for me because i think it affected people ' s lives on in a way that you could see one thing that i noticed is it ' s very convenient to be alcoholic in sweden
oh really
because it ' s treated as a disease now i don ' t know if that necessarily has to be part of socialized medicine but
hum
also another thing that i noticed that was very strange i was i would go down all these
i remember this one row of houses and they were row houses or townhouses all connected together so it was like lower middle - class housing well it ' d be lower middle - class housing here it ' s probably
um - hum
middle - class housing there and there was a taxi driver that lived in one of these and there was a doctor that lived in one of these the one guy was a doctor and one was a taxi driver and so
uh - huh
their incomes were about the same
hum
whereas here there ' s a great incentive to be a doctor because there ' s a great financial reward and that didn ' t exist in sweden
right
right
and overall i their health care suffered a fair amount from just the fact that the doctor salaries were lower and it was it was
less professional and it was treated more like a like a taxi driver type job then a then a doctor type job
yeah i that is that is something i ' ve heard i had a friend that i worked with that was from sweden and that was
probably the major concern i have is that you know we are leading in the technology realm of
of medicine just because it is such a great incentive to get into the medical field but at the same time
the competition
in a lot of ways is wonderful just because you can choose your doctor and
they have to compete to be to be good and to be knowledgeable but at the same time there ' s a
you know they ' re regulating themselves and the hospitals are charging just enormous amounts for products that they don ' t have to pay very much for
my i have a brother who ' s a vet and for something that he can get you know wholesale and i ' m sure they can get a lot cheaper because they hospitals buy in such a bulk rate
right
you know they could charge you twenty dollars for a dollar fifty item and that ' s ridiculous and i don ' t think that is that is abnormal in any means to be doing things like that and
you don ' t think it ' s abnormal
i don ' t think that is that is abnormal for hospitals to be doing that at all
oh i see you ' re not saying it ' s right you ' re just saying it ' s common
yeah and so it ' s i think i to me i think something that ' s going to help our medical arena is for
and i don ' t know how to i don ' t know how to do this but i think people are too lawsuit happy and i mean things will happen and you ' ve got to
keep up or you ' ve got to realize that you know it is just men or women that are that are making decisions and they will make mistakes and
you know if people you know there are some people that i ' m sure make mistakes because they just
don ' t keep on top of it but there are other things that just happen that you can ' t you know you can ' t
say you know well if you had just done this you know things would have done differently and
i don ' t know i think the fact that malpractice has gone up i think has raised our prices just dramatically
are they doing a lot of recycling out in georgia
well at my workplace they are we have places for aluminum cans and we have everybody ' s been issued a separate trash can for
recyclable paper let ' s see them get that word straight
uh - huh
as far as the community goes it ' s pretty much voluntary nothing ' s been done i don ' t where i live i live in an unincorporated area
and we don ' t have any we have just private garbage services and
yeah i it is it is to some degree inconvenient i ' d have to say that
and it ' s not big enough it ' s kind of it ' s kind of silly and what you do is you put out paper like paper bags and newspaper and cardboard
and that you put separately and you also put out in this little ridiculous container any cans or bottles you have you know like your campbell soup cans and your milk cartons and that kind of stuff
hm
and then the rest you can you throw out and the town picks it up
i ' ve heard of communities where you have to separate your garbage and then put what ' s left in a clear plastic ga bag so they can kind of look and see if you ' re throwing out what you shouldn ' t i thought that was pretty amusing
have the garbage police looking after you i guess
i imagine i don ' t know
well i used to live in california and just before i left they were some communities were making that mandatory and
well you know it ' s funny we just got back from a trip to california visiting some friends near san francisco and san jose and we ' d see these signs on the road that said garbage pickup two exits down or something
the for the apartment dwellers they didn ' t make it easy to recycle at all what they did was you would bring it to this garbage place that they designated
and the lions club or you know some community organization would do you the favor of picking it up from there you really had to go out of your way to recycle
yeah you know and most people probably don ' t wanna carry a couple of bags worth of garbage in their car a few miles i mean it ' s all it ' s a good idea we should all do it but
if it from a practical viewpoint from a selfish viewpoint if communities made it easy and convenient for you to do it they would have a lot more participation in my opinion
well around here i it ' s not too bad because on tuesdays you put out your paper and your cans and plastic things and they go away so that i mean that ' s not too tough to put that at the end of your driveway
yeah
right
my friends in california have this special garbage fill where they collect all their soda cans and they kind of leave it near the dumpster knowing that the neighborhood kids will grab them because they can sell them or something for recycling
uh - huh
oh
gee you haven ' t
so they just leave it out for the vultures to take
gee kids around here i don ' t think would pay well wouldn ' t pay any attention to it they ' d the dogs would get to it before they would i would imagine
oh well the soda cans where i live are good for a nickel a piece
wow
so if you bring them to the local supermarket they have these can crushers and you know you throw all the cans in one at a time it takes a lot of time and you push a button and you get a nickel for every can because you had to pay a deposit on it when you bought it
oh
and you find these old men and these bag people collecting all these things and hauling them in big garbage bags and they just like take up one of these machines to get you know couple of bucks for beer or something
is that a city or state law that requires it to be recycled or
yeah it ' s a state well new york state does it and i know vermont a lot of the eastern states do it
so you get a lot of old people one old fellow had crates of beer he made friends with a bartender at some bar and he gets all the beer bottles because the guy can ' t be bothered with it
and he said he bought himself i said that ' s pretty heavy for you isn ' t it and he says well i just bought myself an old station wagon to cart you know this is a real business for him he ' s making big bucks
well i bet that ' s resulted in it would seem to me that ' s resulted in some cleaner highways i would imagine
well do you do any recycling
we do here see what do we recycle we they recycle they have bins
yeah
and they also have centers where you can take aluminum cans and plastic bottles
and i think that ' s all they have
oh
what about you guys
well we there ' s a lot of things that you can recycle down here although the only thing i guess i wind up recycling religiously is aluminum cans
uh - huh
but we ' ve got a we ' ve got a couple of different things places they ' re like unattended
really for smashed cans
uh - huh
and when you do that it basically crushes them and then drops a penny down a little shoot
oh can you can you hold on for just a minute i ' m gonna try pressing one again to make sure that i pressed it hard enough because - kay just a second
sure
okay
okay
oh okay well i guess
i guess
yeah okay well anyways you guys only get a penny a can well when you buy like canned drinks and stuff like that do they charge you for the deposit
no you probably get charged like a nickel or something like that
yeah exactly and so it ' s like they charge you for the deposit so when you turn in the cans unsmashed you ' re just like reimbursed
oh okay no they don ' t charge us that extra nickel
type of thing
that ' s sort of nice though
yeah it really is really what happens is we just get a penny a can back
off the off the price if you wanna think of it that way so when we get like a twelve pack then that ' s like twelve cents back
uh - huh
but they have sort of like things that you you ' re not like reimbursed for or paid for like we can recycle clear glass brown glass green glass
yeah
and milk jugs and
newspapers you know everyone does newspapers
yeah everybody does newspapers
but that kind of stuff
yeah
but they said they can ' t be smashed or else it doesn ' t fit in their little containers and they ' re not reimbursed by the people who are over them or something
i tell you what really works at least down here is if there is if there is some even some money basically to take care of the gas
to recycle it you know what i mean then people tend to do it
yeah that ' s
in other words taking care of the environment is all well and good
um - hum
but if it ' s gonna cost you to take care of the environment they ' re not quite as likely to do it as if as if you get something back for it
as likely to do it yeah
you know and so you know if there are some energy savings or if there ' s some significant savings anything that they can pass on to the consumer
yeah that ' s true
you know it kind of reminds me of using an atm card
you know to get money or doing your banking you know if it ' s free people will use it if it costs them something then they ' re not as likely to use it
uh - huh yeah
yeah exactly
you know
but i know we had a problem down here with oil people taking oil out of their cars
uh - huh
and just putting it down the you know the drain sewer
yeah
and all that because there was apparently a lot of people you know every time they change the oil they just dump all the their old oil down there now they ' re starting to recycle that stuff
uh - huh
oh that ' s good
another thing i thought of i guess to recycle would be like clothes because i mean everybody gets rid of their clothes sometime or other
we can take some of our clothes to the consignment shops
yeah
and that way you know you don ' t get near enough as much as you bought it for but you got the use out of it and what you ' re gonna basically donate to a goodwill or whatever anyways you can get a little bit of money for
yeah
okay do you have a garden
i have several outside shrubs that i maintain take care of
um - hum do you enjoy working out in the yard
yeah i certainly do i planted a rosebed last year
um - hum
and they came out looking really nice lot of red and white ones pink
uh - huh i ' ve had some roses out in my backyard too and they ' ve done real well i was surprised
i we had some in virginia and they were real hard to keep up with but seems like they like the texas climate better
right yeah we built up our we built up boxes and put them in that so that they would drain because our soil is so bad
where i live do you live in texas or
yeah i ' m in plano
plano oh yeah i ' m out in rowlett and we have that brown clay soil and it ' s real hard to grow
anything here
yeah i ' ve got a well my roses are on the west side of the house i asked my neighbors what they wanted to see outside their front door
uh - huh
um - hum
yeah and i still need to assess the damage outside from the freeze this winter
yeah
right we ' ve got a few things too it ' s hard to tell if they ' ll come back or not
yeah the trees are all doing really well i ' ve got a nice japanese maple out front that
looking really nice right now
well that ' s good we
we planted three pecan trees out front and every one of them died i told my husband this is the last one if it dies we ' re going to something else
uh - huh
but we dug a hole about six times as big as it needs to be and filled it with all kinds of compost and
pine needles and everything else we could think of hopefully it ' ll drain this year
yeah
yeah every year there ' s some freeze damage and i lose different variety of shrubs
yeah
have to go replace them with something a little hardier
yeah it ' s hard to find something that ' ll take the heat as well as the freezing
um - hum
that we get down here i have a few little flowers i plant around the trees out front i ' ve enjoyed
doing those i put pansies out in the winter and
they pretty much last all winter and then i put moss rose out in the summer and it just goes crazy you don ' t really have to do anything to it
uh - huh
puts a lot of color out there
yeah i don ' t do much with flowers myself i just get a lot of evergreen type shrubs some
all year
right
some dwarf burford hollies and yaupon hollies
oh yeah
those do pretty well here don ' t they
they do very well um - hum
we ' ve got my husband put a little row of those out in the backyard to kind of
make a little cut so that the kids wouldn ' t come marching through the yard and everything
yeah they make a nice hedge
yeah
and the nice thing about those types of hollies is you don ' t have to trim them into a boxy type hedge
you can just let them grow their natural shape
right yeah the only thing i don ' t like about them is weeding around them because they get so sharp
pricky things get in your hands
oh yeah oh i ' ve got some chinese hollies that are just outrageous
they are very sharp
oh really
do you do your own lawn maintenance or do you hire somebody to do that
yeah we do it my husband does most of the mowing and edging and all that stuff
yeah i do that myself too i too really don ' t appreciate them calling me up all the time to try to push their services on me
yeah we get something on the door about every week
because i ' ve got a very small yard the entire size of the lot is only forty five by ninety feet
uh - huh
it ' s what they call low maintenance yard and these maintenance companies call up wanting to
put the weed killer and the fertilizer down and they want they want to charge forty or forty five dollars per application for my size yard i don ' t spend that much in a year
yeah really
oh our neighbor has a lawn service come and do his and i don ' t think it looks any better than what my husband does so
uh - huh
i ' m not really tempted to do that either
if
it doesn ' t take much work
yeah i can mow the backyard but there ' s something about the grass in our front yard is so dense
huh
uh - huh
that the mower wheels just kind of bog down in there and i can not push it
yeah i ' ve got a little electric mower and i will never buy another one of those again
oh
really
it ' s fine for my size yard but it really doesn ' t have the power of a gas motor
huh
i would like a self - propelled one i think
um - hum
that might make it easier
it ' s better for a large yard
yeah
before i moved down here when i was up north in wisconsin living with my folks they lived on three and a half acres of land and we started mowing that with a push mower
oh
yeah that ' s a pretty large area
it still took a few hours even with the riding mower
really
did people up there edge as pri as strictly and stuff as they do down here
not nearly as much as here
i think it ' s probably because we lived out in the country somewhat and there just wasn ' t the emphasis on keeping the yards looking real nice
yeah
yeah i lived in a town it was a college town in virginia and i mean people kept their lawns mowed but they sure didn ' t get into it like they do here in texas
wasn ' t a source of pride or something like it is down here
yeah a lot of people do but then again there are a lot who do nothing
yeah
my street is
kind of in between there are a couple of neighbors who are really good about planting flowers and trees
um - hum
but there the majority really haven ' t done anything with their yards this neighborhood is four years old
yeah
and you would think that in that time they ' d get their lawns and gardens established
yeah it ' s hard i know we tried to do our landscaping out front my husband
tilled it up in the fall and then we ' ve been waiting on some guy supposed to be getting us some edging for like ten cents a foot instead of about a dollar
um - hum
yeah i ' d like to see the neighbors put some trees in the front yards anyway just to get something started
yeah
it ' d seem like they ' d want to just to get some shade and keep their houses a little bit cooler in the summer
right
you ' d think that would be the first thing they would do as far as the yard goes is to plant a tree
yeah
it ' s nice when the builders plant trees for you when they build the house
yeah did they not put any in your neighborhood
no my builder was gemcraft and they didn ' t put trees in at all
we had two trees in the front of our yard and then one of them died and so we that ' s where we keep putting that pecan
keeps dying we have i think it ' s a silver leaf maple or something like that that ' s hung on out there
yeah
the trouble with builders planting the trees is they get the weaker varieties ones that aren ' t as desirable
right
and those include arizona ash and in some cases silver maples
yeah
hope ours continues to live it ' s been there about four i guess almost four years now so maybe it ' s established enough that it ' ll go on and survive
yeah that ' s probably true i ' ve got a live oak in front i really like the oaks a lot
i like an oak trees yeah
they ' re very hardy for this area
my husband ' s father has a place out in east texas so he ' s always digging up little
red oaks and things like that and trying to bring them back and start them but
um - hum
so far we haven ' t had much luck
oh i had a red oak a few years ago that i bought from
oh
and the other reason was that i bought it in spring and it was a balled and bur lapped tree right before summer the heat of summer it couldn ' t take the heat and it died
oh
yeah well that ' s too bad
we ' ve got all of our trees from calloway ' s and luckily they ' ll take them back any time for any reason if they die so
yeah i usually go to callaway ' s or wolfe
um - hum
callaway ' s tends to have nicer shrubs more fully developed
uh - huh
and i don ' t think there ' s a problem with the warranty on any of those places although they have cut back on their warranty for the shrubs the past couple of years
yeah i know the guy at wolfe told us they cut back on the tree warranty like six months or less
yeah
but calloway ' s has kept theirs forever so
really well that ' s good for trees i don ' t think they do that for shrubs
yeah
yeah i don ' t know we haven ' t bought
i think it ' s still a year or less for shrubs
uh - huh we haven ' t bought any shrubs yet hopefully
i think we ' ve almost waited this too late this year now to start putting in anything of any size
oh it ' s never too late to plant something unless well for trees if they ' re balled and bur lapped it ' s recommended to plant them in the fall or winter
yeah
but for just shrubs say five gallon or one gallon shrubs any time of the year is fine
oh really it wouldn ' t matter if we plant them when it was starting to get warmer
right just have to take care of them and water them so they get established put some
root stimulator yeah
right some stimulator down
so yeah it ' s never a problem to plant things in the summer
oh well that ' s good to know maybe there ' s still hope for our front yard this summer then
i ' m just waiting for a sale
uh - huh
they haven ' t really had any good sales on plants yet
yeah i ' ve noticed that they haven ' t had anything great
so
right yeah
yeah except last year we thought some were dead and finally they started leafing out again at the bottom so we just cut them way back and was able to save them but this year they look even worse
you have to watch the like the crepe myrtles
um - hum
because they ' ll look really bad like they ' re dead
and all of a sudden they ' ll bud out
yeah
i ' ve got several crepe myrtles that look just awful
and there are buds coming out all over the place now
huh ours haven ' t done anything yet this year
i have a crepe myrtle tree in the backyard that still hasn ' t done anything and i ' m kind of wondering what kind of shape it ' s in right now
yeah i like crepe myrtles they really add a lot of color
in the summer
they can
right they can get out of control
oh really
but mine keep dying back down to the ground so i haven ' t had that problem yet
yeah
but i do have some really nice boston ivy on the west side of the house
oh
does it grow along a fence or something
grows on the on the brick
oh
on the house itself
uh - huh
that you have to really watch to keep it under control because they will take over a house if you don ' t tend to it
