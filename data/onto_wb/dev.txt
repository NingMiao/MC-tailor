Only time right now for some quick thoughts on Haditha .
Or rather , Haditha 's elevation as Iraq 's official , bad apple atrocity .
Even for those who try to pay attention to what filters through the fog of war crimes , these things tend to run together .
Haditha is n't Abu Sifa where , according to Iraqi police , US forces '' on a rampage '' executed a family of 11 , then bombed their house , burned their cars and slaughtered their animals .
What more will we hear of Abu Sifa , now Haditha has become the representative and inevitable example of honour 's exception ?
Because along with Haditha comes Jesse Macbeth , allegedly a former Army Ranger and Iraq war veteran , whose claims that massacre was method rather than madness rapidly went viral on the Net .
His story was unsubstantiated and exteme , yet plausible because it was extreme , and provided a template to the pattern of force on exhibit in Iraq .
A pattern rarely admitted by the West 's institutional media .
But Macbeth , it now appears , is the Pentagon 's timely strawman to buttress its case for Haditha 's exceptionalism , and to discredit influential anti-war voices such as Iraq Veterans Against the War .
Whether unaware or not of his status as a COINTELPRO asset , it does n't matter ,
because regardless , Macbeth became a lucky charm for those who refuse to believe the program of horror in which US troops are engaged ,
and there are many .
Similar stories may now be said to have been `` debunked , '' without examination or a straining of battlefield ethics .
It was a scandal 20 years ago when Ronald Reagan - the Bush family 's post-Hinkley Zombie - in - Chief - honoured the SS dead at Bitburg , and by turn paid homage to the old fascist `` anti-communist '' front of the Republican Heritage Groups Council .
It was , perhaps , merely a prefigurement of the Nazi stain in America 's own blood cult , and what should be a crisis of conscience on Memorial Day .
On supposedly progressive forums I 've seen many apologies for Haditha , and for the other Hadithas still cloaked in denial .
Do n't judge the troops too quickly , or too harshly , some write ,
because `` Hell is full of heroes . ''
Heaven , meanwhile , fills with children .
There is no decent place to stand , not in a massacre .
Sorry Jeff
I have posted to you before about this
and I really do not care one iota .
There are too many people in the world ,
resources are limited under current economic models
and this has always gone on .
It 's all about real estate
and this is just foreplay ,
the fucking starts with China ,
deal with it .
As war has become more technologically advanced more civilians have died ,
look at Goya for god 's sake .
It 's not right ,
it 's not wrong ,
it just is ....
Grow up
and quit bitchin ....
Forward over the fallen
and quit moaning over the downsides of Globalisation .
Try reading Philip Caputos ' A Rumour of War .
Anonymous 2:52 , if someone would kill your family - would you also say it 's not right , it 's not wrong , it just is ?
With attitudes like that , there truly is no hope for this planet anymore .
We might as well push the reboot button right now .
`` hell is full of heroes ''
what the fuck does that mean ?
Is this a good thing ?
Is slaughtering people a good thing ?
And what 's anonymous on about ?
`` Grow up
and quit bitchin '' ?
Do we roll over and say this sort of thing is okay just because the ' current economic models ' say so ?
Anonymouth .
A - non - entity .
I think for most Americans the sanctity of the god - fearing soldier going out and making the world right is too near and dear a concept .
`` Support the troops , not the regime ''
That 's a noble idea until you 're supporting the weight of an armoured vehicle on your chest .
The disallusionment of this country is progressing apace
and I sense the growing desperation as people realize that just believing we 're on the right side might not necessarily make it so .
The first `` anonymous '' poster here is certainly a fellow with his own screwed up head stick up his own disgusting ass .
I also think his own understanding of the artistic works he references - Francisco Goya 's Disasters of War and Caputo 's book -- is also supremely naive .
I suggest he take an elementary course in art appreciation at his local university or community college .
`` It 's not right ,
it 's not wrong ,
it just is ... ''
i am so glad some anonymous fuck posted this --
it only proves jeff 's point -LRB- made implicitly and explicitly throughout this entire blog -RRB- that there is a cancer in this country that continues to eat at it : a cancerous heritage linked to nazism and fascism and slavery and holocaust and slaughter ...

In the fields the bodies burning As the war machine keeps turning
Death and hatred to mankind Poisoning their brainwashed minds
Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the way
Why do n't the go out to fight ?
They leave that up to the poor
Time will tell on their power minds
Making war just for fun
Treating people just like pawns in chess
Wait till their Judgement Day comes
Now in darkness world stops turning
Ashes where the bodies burning
No more War Pigs have the power
Hand of God has struck the hour
Day of Judgement , God is calling
On their knees the War Pigs crawling
Begging mercy for their sins
Satan laughing spreads his wings
Happy Mammonorial Day
The Anonymous at 2:52 PM , albeit lobotomized by the iron triangle 's propaganda , hit upon a major point we should all be aware of .
Iraq , or Iran for that matter , are just foreplay .
The real act occurs when the Empire takes on China .
The only way an industrial power can take on another with ten times its population base is by using what it thinks is its overwhelming advantage .
That would be a massive nuclear strike , incincerating all opposition before it could mobilize , and using its new warfighter technology to mop up everything else .
In the long run , it may be that the Middle Eastern conflagrations are designed to harden the American people to the inevitability of genocide .
Not that it really is inevitable : but it would make ruling a whole lot easier for a government controlled by the military front of the world 's largest private equity firm .
'' .. when the police state crushes HIS family , .. ''
The problem with that catchy idea is that the participants of empire are mostly assured they have a safe haven *when* the bottom falls out or assume they do more so than smuks like me or you .
Let 's face it :
Money buys some security ;
a lot of money buys a lot of security ,
and those that have access to it KNOW what 's going on and have made plans accordingly .
Unfortunately anon 2:52 is n't that far off in Twilight Zone kind of way -
although I do not agree with h / hr ethic morality , there are too many people on earth RIGHT NOW ,
that is , if they ALL WANT to have a car and drive to the mall - and a lot of them are waking up to that idea , which , as it stands now , is impossible .
His nonchelant benign God force mannerism is appalling and is apparent in the Neo-Con World of the Project for a New American Century , which if I 'm not mistaken , did address the issues of exactly what is being said here .
Anotherwords : You are either with us or against us .
Even if you 're with us you might die a horrible death ,
but you still have a chance albeit a minor one .
To paraphrase :
`` They who hold the gold , makes the rules .
Those who hold the gold AND the guns make the reality . ''
From LRC blog :
A Breakdown in Thinking
Posted by Butler Shaffer at 12:53 PM
News reports inform us that American military officials are now convinced that a unit of Marines killed some 24 unarmed Iraqis , including women and six children .
Some of the victims had been shot `` execution style . ''
One government official stated that this atrocity showed `` a total breakdown in morality . ''
What on earth do these officials think all war is , if not a `` breakdown in morality ? ''
If the systematic slaughter of tens or hundreds of thousands of human beings does n't represent a `` breakdown in morality , '' what does ?
Do we have to wait for some major offense , such as illicit sex in the oval office ?
I would go even further than this :
`` war is the mobilization of immorality . ''
Would these apologists for such killings have been satisfied if the same deaths to the same innocents had been brought about by aerial bombs ?
I am reminded of a distinction one of my students tried making a few years ago in contrasting suicide bombers with militarily disciplined killing :
`` at least we have the decency to drop bombs from airplanes , '' he declared .
I wonder what kind of spin the twits at Faux News are putting on this for their audience of the bloodthirsty !
On this Memorial Day weekend , it would be worthwhile for Americans - whose government is running this abattoir - to recognize the immorality of their support for such madness .
Those who wave their flags , or emblazon their cars with `` support the troops '' messages , are as much to blame for this so - called `` breakdown in morality '' as anyone else .
Out of a sense of moral decency , this weekend might be an appropriate occasion to remove such symbols from their cars , homes , and - better yet - their minds !
Question : did U.S. troops in WW2 shoot children while their mothers tried to shield them , screaming for mercy ?
Remember Maggot , the Telly Savalas rapist - character from `` The Dirty Dozen ? ''
Jim Brown machine - gunned him for messing with a German woman in a simple act of field justice .
That sort of moral action seemed fairly unremarkable to people back then .
Fast - forward to today 's GI : innured to violence by a lifetime of ultra-violent `` Kill Bill '' movies , ultra-violent FPS video games , he has become the thing an earlier generation was taught was most detestable : a nazi storm trooper , a self - appointed SS death 's - head executioner .
Bereft of any sense of the sacred , he shoots little girls without compunction .
He is , quite literally , insane , a `` Natural Born Killer . ''
These atavistic carrion - birds surely will come home to roost ,
and one thing seems undeniable :
it 's not going to be pretty when they do .
I do n't just mean the troops returning from Iraq : I mean the whole malevolent Culture of Death .
Go for a drive in any U.S. city
and witness the seething hatred Americans have for each other .
`` Your streets will be smeared with blood , '' as the prophecy has it .
A society built on lies , where respect for human life is absent , where every media outlet mirrors the bloodlust , is a society doomed .
`` And what rough beast , its hour come round at last ? ''
Iraq has been a training ground .
Sane people come home scarred for life from such a place .
The real psychopaths graduate to high paying private security contractor jobs and are destined to become the Praetorian Guard for the New World Order .
On that last video game piece , I just posted a comment , referring to a serial killer toy set .
And an article about it .
the article was written 17 years ago about a kid who was not yet near puberty .
Kind of Bart or Lisa 's age back in the days of the original simpsons .
The kid who bought that toy would be in their mid to late 20s right now , possibly with a tour or two of Iraq under their belts .
It 's not the `` Kill Bills '' or the video games that cause this bullshit , not even serial killer toys .
It 's the lack of true culture and connection to anything that really fucks things up .
It 's not the movies ... or the games .
That is it .
After all , ALL life is sacred .
Or none .
there is no middle ground .
-LRB- PS I am a carnivore ,
things die for me to live .
The life they had is sacred too . -RRB-
To all of you who have never been in a war ....
there is no morality in war . ''
I heard a WW2 vet say this tonight .
Could n't agree more .
It 's one good reason why wars should be last resorts instead of the cool graphics embellished infotainment spectacles that they are .
It 's also why the ultimate responsibility for this lies at Washington 's doorstep .
& , ultimately , at our doorsteps .
Washington sold us a bill of goods
& we were too damn lazy to uncover the bill of goods .
Hell , I bet more Americans do more research to buy a f*cking clothes dryer than they did before they bought this war , hook line & sinker .
Of course , a lot of Americans have flip flopped over to the against column .
I just hope they do n't try to scapegoat these boys for acting badly in reeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaal goddamn bad situation that WE sent them into .
& I do mean WE .
I thought this was a bad idea from the start ,
but what did I do to stop it ?
Wrote my representatives & garnered a collection of condescending form `` You just do n't understand the situation '' letters in return , signed a couple of petitions marched in a march .......
woo - fucking - woo .
In other words , I did n't do shit .
But then , neither did anyone else .
You do n't have to be drunk to cause a car accident .
When Roman soldiers asked John the baptist how should they prepare themselves for this Messiah in the book of Luke , John responded , '' Do not terrify men with a view to extortion , neither accuse anyone falsely ;
and be content with your wages .
For an excellent exposure of Chinese Communism go to www.ninecommentaries.com
The following four paragraphs are taken from this website .
For the Chinese Communists killing is also necessary for practical reasons .
The Communist Party began as a group of thugs and scoundrels who killed to obtain power .
Once this precedent was set , there was no going back .
Constant terror was needed to intimidate people and force them to accept , out of fear , the absolute rule of the Chinese Communist Party .
In a normal society , people show care and love for one another , hold life in awe and veneration and give thanks to God .
In the East , people say , `` Do not impose on others what you would not want do to yourself . ''
In the West , people say , `` Love thy neighbor as thyself . ''
Conversely , the CCP holds that `` The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles . ''
In order to keep alive the `` struggles '' within society , hatred must be generated .
Not only does the CCP take lives , it encourages people to kill each other .
It strives to desensitize people towards others ' suffering by surrounding them with constant killing .
It wants them to become numb from frequent exposure to inhumane brutality , and develop the mentality that `` the best you can hope for is to avoid being persecuted . ''
All these lessons taught by brutal suppression enable the CCP to maintain its rule .
In addition to the destruction of countless lives , the CCP also destroyed the soul of the Chinese people .
A great many people have become conditioned to react to the CCP 's threats by entirely surrendering their reason and their principles .
In a sense , these people 's souls have died - something more frightening than physical death .
Back in 1903 , Yale Divinity School established a number of schools and hospitals throughout China that were collectively known as ' Yale in China . '
One of ' Yale in China 's ' most important students was Mao Zedong .
During World War II , ' Yale in China ' was a primary instrument used by the U.S. Establishment and its Office of Strategic Services -LRB- OSS -RRB- to install the Maoists into power .
' Yale in China ' was run by OSS operative Reuben Holden , the husband of Bush 's cousin , and also a member of the Skull and Bones .
`` Yale in China '' was also closely associated with the New York - based Union Theological Seminary , which has been a center for U.S. subversion of Asia .
`` The Maoists made China into the world 's largest opium producer . ''
According to Kathy Griggs , this revolutionary terrorist group is controlling the Marines and Army .
They all operate together .
They actually promoted communists in the OSS , which was started by William Donovan .
So they promote and use communists , who actually want to get rid of the form of U.S. government as a stepping stone to world domination .
So this group , now , in the Army and Marine Corp. has communists at the very top .
One example of this truth is the goings on at Abu Ghraib U.S. Military Prison , which is located twenty miles west of Baghdad .
A large percent of prisoners there have not commited any criminal acts agaisnt the coalition .
The military has a policy of `` random sweeps '' whenever the base is under attack .
They gather all men in the area between the ages 17 for questioning to Abu Ghraib Prison .
After finding out the men 's innocence they are slated for release .
But because of military bureaucracy this can be as long as one year .
General Kapinski states in the `` Taguba Report '' Section 24 -LRB- U -RRB- that as many as 60 percent of Abu Ghraib prisoners are not guilty of any crimes committed agaisnt the coalition .
The release of these innocent prisoners was denied by General Majowski 2nd in command in Iraq .
On the internet type Iraq : Beyond Abu Ghraib : Detention and torture in Iraq .
This is the Amnesty International Report .
Also the February 2004 International Red Cross Report Section 7 which states that 70 to 90 percent of all prisoners held at Abu Ghraib were innocent .
To announce that there must be no criticism of the president , or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong , is not only unpatriotic , and servile , but is morally treasonable to the American public .
- Theodore Roosevelt -
Perhaps the whole reason Mao did his thing was because he was against what he learnt from `` Yale in China '' .
Perhaps he was trying to destroy the influence of a group he felt were trying to rule the world .
Just a thought .
Probably wrong , but maybe not .
One practical result of Mao was the cultural revolution .
This probably severed the Chinese zeitgeist from its cultural and spiritual base .
Its 's easier to commit atrocities in the name of power in this way IMO , well easier to motivate others to do it for you .
Disconnection from the source .
Yet again .
`` A pattern rarely admitted by the West 's institutional media . ''
Rarely admitted that we follow that pattern too .
Its 's always others elsewhere that do that evil stuff .
There seems to be a trend of this sort .
This guy -LRB- Macbeth , great name -RRB- and 911 show a similar pattern .
There is -LRB- potentially -RRB- an ugly truth , either US military violence against civilians , or US admin complicity or responsibility for violence against its own and foreign civilians -LRB- in the WTC , Pentagon and various aircraft -RRB- .
Extreme sensationalist claims surface that may be true -LRB- No jews died in the WTC -RRB- others events that are confirmed , like the van full of Israelis , are shown to be true and suddenly the claim seems even more plausible .
That claim is then exposed as crap , and particularly offensive crap at that , -LRB- especially if you are related to some of the dead Jewish paople from the WTC -RRB- .
Other amazing , hard to credit claims follow , the planes were holograms , or were n't there or whatever .
And the money trail , or the stupidities , like the finding of a highjacker 's passport in the rubble within 12 hours of the event , or the reports of the Seattle Mayor being warned not to fly to the east coast on 911 , or the Bin ladens ' charter flight out of the US during the `` no fly '' period ; all that disappears under the weight of scorn flung at the claims that are wrong .
Here we will show you the truth , but only in a form you can not possibly believe .
Very clever .
So instead of thousands of US soldiers snapping and killing the odd Iraqi civillian , or five . We have claims that many or all US soldiers are murdering Iraqis by the hundreds .
If that was the case there would be fuck all people left in Iraq .
Obviously crap , spoken by a nutter , anything he says or anything that comes from a similar place belongs in the same file `` batshit crazy rubbish designed to discredit us '' .
Truth is soldiers do horrible things in war .
things they would probably have never thought themselves capable of .
Most western armies probably do try to moderate this , just for PR reasons and political ones .
But I bet such concerns are far from the minds of military leaders who can not be bothered to equip or supply their own troops properly .
If the army is disciplined and honourable it is designed to prevent such excesses , designed to produce fearsome perfect warriors who will kill you in a million different ways , but only if you are evil and fight them .
Pity those armies only exist in niave children 's imaginations , or fantasy novels set in mythical worlds .
All this babbling here will remedy nothing .
Ask God 's forgiveness .
Get out while you can .
Revelation 18 : 18:1 And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven , having great power ;
and the earth was lightened with his glory .
18:2 And he cried mightily with a strong voice , saying , Babylon the great is fallen , is fallen , and is become the habitation of devils , and the hold of every foul spirit , and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird .
18:3 For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication ,
and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her ,
and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies .
18:4 And I heard another voice from heaven , saying , Come out of her , my people , that ye be not partakers of her sins , and that ye receive not of her plagues .
18:5 For her sins have reached unto heaven , and God hath remembered her iniquities .
Here we go again ...
Remember : there is no conspiracy .
Let 's go over this article slowly , shall we ?
First of all , every war has its share of atrocities and massacres , on both sides .
To think otherwise is to be totally naive and uninformed .
Wait , that is a good definition of the American public in general --
but that 's another story .
A few examples of this .
The Boer war : first case of concentration camps , run by the British to exterminate rebels fighting against the British Empire .
WWI saw regular massacres of unarmed German soldiers who had surrendered to the allies .
WWII saw the bombing of Dresden , a target with very little military importance , and home to thousands of refugees .
Berlin was sacked and thousands of German women raped by the Red Army in 1945 .
Korea witnessed several civilian massacres .
Vietnam had My Lai , and the Tiger Force .
So , today , there are massacres in Iraq ?
The cynic in me just replies : `` And this is ... news ? '' .
Repeat after me , people :
if dumb - as - bricks Americans did not want their precious military to be sullied by civilian massacres , they should not have given President `` W '' Bush the right to invade .
Except very few American citizens had the courage to stand and protest .
And , you mean , the army is now trying to hide the horrible , horrible fact that dozens , maybe hundreds of civilians were murdered in cold blood by US soldiers ?
And this is a conspiracy ?
Wake up , people !
Ever since war exists -LRB- meaning : the dawn of time -RRB- , civilians have been brutalized , raped , tortured and murdered ,
and the higher - ups have covered this by saying drivel and b*llshit such as : `` We do n't torture people in America . ''
-LRB- actual Presidential quote -RRB- .
Please , people , there is no conspiracy here : just a bunch of morons , realizing they have unleashed horror on innocents and trying to cover their asses .
Why do you think only lowly soldiers and no generals have been convicted ?
Because generals have the power , that 's why !
So , one soldier stood up and talked about some razed shithole in Iraq ?
Maybe he is going overboard and creating a fancy tale of horror ?
So what ?
That 's not a cover - up , that 's just some dumb -- and scarred for life -- white trash making shit up .
Of course , the US military is going to jump at the chance to sweep the real skeletons under the carpet , so to speak .
Business as usual , and war is good business .
Nothing to see here , people , move along .
This is the result of more than 60 years of military conditioning .
In WWII , most of the soldiers refused to shoot at people , and shot either in the air or -- at least -- above the heads of enemy soldiers .
In Iraq , well - conditioned army psychopaths are going to shoot at everything that moves .
You do n't like it ?
Too bad , you voted for the moron .
Twice .
One last time :
repugnant ?
Yes .
Disgusting ?
Yes .
Obvious ?
Yes .
Conspiracy ?
No .
It 's just the normal m.o. of the biggest military machine ever created on Earth .
Yay , USA !
Home of the psychos and Land of the militaro - industrial complex !
All praise God , and pass the ammo , we are going to smoke ourselves some Iraqis !
All in the name of God , and freedom , and democracy , and justice , and a foetus ! -LRB- as Bill Hicks would say -RRB-
40 years from now , more horrors , more massacres are going to be unearthed ...
No conspiracy here , people ,
Probably just in time for the next senseless war .
the dumbs leading the sheeps is more like it .
Some mapmakers draw their conclusions on time and space with civil holidays spread out neatly across the spectrum .
There is no `` now '' in Remembrance Day or Groundhog Day or Memorial Day or any other ICON of DAYS .
Now is not the reason why we have the ICON of DAYS .
Now is silent and the landscaape is mindscape is timescape is sanctified .
Sure you can protest Rembembrance Day .
Just do n't wear a poppy .
Now that 's making a statement .
DA : speaking of `` razed shitholes in Iraq '' is employing the language of dehumanization , yes ?
Is a razed shithole in Iraq terribly different from a razed shithole in , say , Waco , Texas ?
Please do n't forget that the Iraqis never did anything to us 'ns .
We 're the bully in their yard ,
and might makes right in the doublespeak of the fascisti .
`` Profits , not people , '' dude .
In your little history lesson -LRB- why not go back to the Romans who slaughtered everyone in Carthage , or , for that matter , the Israelites in the OT , commanded by Yawheh to slaughter man , women , and child ? -RRB- , you mention the bombing of Dresden .
I 'll toss in Hiroshima and Nagasaki ,
but those pilot - murderers were at one remove from the slaughter they were , uh , enabling :
they did n't have to look at the mother trying to shield her kids before pulling the trigger .
Obviously , the pilots did n't think too much about what was happening on the ground , or they would lose their minds -LRB- their souls had already been burned away , whether they knew it or not -RRB- .
I 'm sure there were GIs shooting innocents in WW2 ,
but that kind of atrocity is not emblamatic of the war , in the way that napalm drops and tiger teams are emblamatic of Vietnam , and Fallujah and Abu Graib and Hadifa will be emblamatic of Iraq .
Denying the effects of violent culture is denying the effects of operant conditioning .
Yes , at the root of our monstrous age is the loss of any sense of the sacred , or , more specifically , the acute sense that humans are created in the image of God and that God is very much real and keeping notes ,
but surely one step towards rediscovering human dignity is acknowledging that culture matters .
No one `` turns off the tv '' before first realizing that tv is unhealthy -LRB- Jerry Mander 's book is brilliant in this regard -RRB- , just as no one will `` avert their eyes from the Imperium '' without realizing that Empire - worship is nothing but Moloch - worship .
Moloch ?
Indeed .
As Mother Teresa put it , `` If we accept that a mother can kill even her own child , how can we tell people not to kill one another ?
Any country that accepts abortion , is not teaching its people to love , but to use any violence to get what it wants . ''
Ouch !
Religiosity !
But most certainly the U.S. is `` using any violence to get what it wants , '' and has been for a long time .
Hey , the undead like Cal Thomas say , `` it 's the cost of freedom . ''
Freedom to do what -- obey ?
I like Edward Abbey 's quote -LRB- and we miss you , Ed -RRB- :
`` freedom begins between your ears . ''
'nuff said .

But please do n't insult our intelligence by claiming all of this could be mitigated if we just worshipped some God more frequently and properly .

So , by definition , your precious God is not there with them in Heaven , since he failed to protect them at all costs , or any cost , for that matter .
Is cost even relevant to this God of yours ?
Either way , your God is disqualified by your qualifications for entrance into heaven .

Dude .
Pat Benatar ?
Hell is paved with the skulls of crapazoid musicians like her .
Question for you .
Was the OT formulation ' what is hateful to you do not do to others ' a fairly rad concept for humans in 1000 BC ?
Or do you think it normal for that time and place ?
And why did the Israelites embrace and defend their silly silly little Torah for lo those many centuries , beset as they were on all sides by truly blood - thirsty pagans ?
How did they do it ?
Was it the yoghurt ?
Was it dumb luck ?
Why defend as a paramount rule what amounts to rather remarkable Humanism ?
Explain the evolutionary biology behind that one , please , and , since you 've set the terms of the debate , leave God out of it .

As for me , I think if people and their governors were enlightened enough to follow that one tenet of Judaism -LRB- or the Christian or Buddhist formulation -RRB- , we 'd all be a lot better off .

I just saw again that quaint little scene in ' Bridge Over the River Kwai ' where Alec Guinness tries to read the Geneva Convention to the fanatic Japanese commander .
The Japanese throws the book down and slaps Alec Guinness in the face .
Imagine a prisoner at Abu Graib or Gitmo trying to read the G.C. to his American interrogator .
Actually , on second thought , do n't try to imagine that .

Then put your money where your mouth is and kill some of your neighbors .
They 're taking your stuff .
`` Deal with it , '' apparently means `` cheerleadng from the bleachers . ''
If right and wrong actually exist , then it 's wrong .
At least a soldier on a battlefield has the excuse that he was following orders , or that in a free - fire zone he could n't tell the guys in the black hats from the guys in the white hat , because accidents fucking happen .
You do n't .
You see it happening , and tacitly approve .
You 're not merely wrong , not merely insane , you 're actively fucking evil .
If someone close to you dies in one silly - ass war for the juice to run your SUV , or you find yourself sitting in a homeless shelter , or standing on a streetcorner and panhandling for change from strangers who could n't give two shits for you , because the fat slobs who run your company decided to outsource your job to people who will work twice as long and hard as you do for a tenth the pay , your credit rating is in negative numbers and your new address is `` No Fixed Address , '' then I pray that I 'm there when someone repeats those exact same words to you .
I 'm sworn to oppose you and people like you with every fiber of my being .
I will build my home out of your bones ,
your blood will be my mortar ,
and I will build a pillar made of your skulls on my yard .
Thanks for shaking me to my senses .
Of course , you 're right .
Allahu Akbar !!!!
For the record , how can I blame something if I do n't acknowledge its existence .
I believe there is something more than me , or us , but what that something constitutes is pure conjecture .
The concept of God made in man 's image is a conspiracy , plain and simple .
A time - honored strategy to control the masses .
David Koresh may very well be the next Christ figure several hundred years from now ,
and if we could be there then , we would tell the orthodoxy created around his legend that they are insane fools ......
and we would promptly be burned at the stake .
Now , as for the psalms , and other enlightening anecdotes , I dig them , baby , wholeheartedly , so long as everybody 's embraced it completely .
If they have n't , and only some have , then the some are lambs to the slaughter .
Hit Me With Your Best Shot .
Fire Away .
I 'm waiting for an answer on Truman .
Is he in heaven ?
We all knew that we were letting loose the dogs of war .
It 's going to be hard , but not impossible , for society to put the dogs of war back in their cages .
You 're both right .
No , EricS , shrubmegiddo is simply full of shit .
`` How can I blame something if I do n't acknowledge it ? ''
How wise .
Que profundo .
Well , d'uh ,
that 's just called DENIAL , moron .
Like what the Foxsies and oil co. shills do re Global Warming .
What a complete dumshit .
Devastating Critique of the Arab World by One of Its Own
Thanks again to my friend Nick Keck for passing this along via e-mail .
It is the text of a speech given by an Arab gentleman before the advisory board of a large multi-nation corporation .
It 's a long but very worthwhile read .
`` A View from the Eye of the Storm ''
Talk delivered by Haim Harari at a meeting of the International Advisory Board of a large multi-national corporation , April , 2004 :
`` As you know , I usually provide the scientific and technological `` entertainment '' in our meetings , but , on this occasion , our Chairman suggested that I present my own personal view on events in the part of the world from which I come .
I have never been and I will never be a Government official and I have no privileged information .
My perspective is entirely based on what I see , on what I read and on the fact that my family has lived in this region for almost 200 years .
You may regard my views as those of the proverbial taxi driver , which you are supposed to question , when you visit a country .
I could have shared with you some fascinating facts and some personal thoughts about the Israeli - Arab conflict .
However , I will touch upon it only in passing .
I prefer to devote most of my remarks to the broader picture of the region and its place in world events .
I refer to the entire area between Pakistan and Morocco , which is predominantly Arab , predominantly Moslem , but includes many non-Arab and also significant non-Moslem minorities .
Why do I put aside Israel and its own immediate neighborhood ?
Because Israel and any problems related to it , in spite of what you might read or hear in the world media , is not the central issue , and has never been the central issue in the upheaval in the region .
Yes , there is a 100 year - old Israeli - Arab conflict ,
but it is not where the main show is .
The millions who died in the Iran - Iraq war had nothing to do with Israel .
The mass murder happening right now in Sudan , where the Arab Moslem regime is massacring its black Christian citizens , has nothing to do with Israel .
The frequent reports from Algeria about the murders of hundreds of civilians in one village or another by other Algerians have nothing to do with Israel .
Saddam Hussein did not invade Kuwait , endanger Saudi Arabia and butcher his own people because of Israel .
Egypt did not use poison gas against Yemen in the 60's because of Israel .
Assad the Father did not kill tens of thousands of his own citizens in one week in El Hamma in Syria because of Israel .
The Taliban control of Afghanistan and the civil war there had nothing to do with Israel .
The Libyan blowing up of the Pan - Am flight had nothing to do with Israel , and I could go on and on and on .
The root of the trouble is that this entire Moslem region is totally dysfunctional , by any standard of the word , and would have been so even if Israel had joined the Arab league and an independent Palestine had existed for 100 years .
The 22 member countries of the Arab league , from Mauritania to the Gulf States , have a total population of 300 millions , larger than the US and almost as large as the EU before its expansion .
They have a land area larger than either the US or all of Europe .
These 22 countries , with all their oil and natural resources , have a combined GDP smaller than that of Netherlands plus Belgium and equal to half of the GDP of California alone .
Within this meager GDP , the gaps between rich and poor are beyond belief
and too many of the rich made their money not by succeeding in business , but by being corrupt rulers .
The social status of women is far below what it was in the Western World 150 years ago .
Human rights are below any reasonable standard , in spite of the grotesque fact that Libya was elected Chair of the UN Human Rights commission .
According to a report prepared by a committee of Arab intellectuals and published under the auspices of the U.N. , the number of books translated by the entire Arab world is much smaller than what little Greece alone translates .
The total number of scientific publications of 300 million Arabs is less than that of 6 million Israelis .
Birth rates in the region are very high , increasing the poverty , the social gaps and the cultural decline .
And all of this is happening in a region , which only 30 years ago , was believed to be the next wealthy part of the world , and in a Moslem area , which developed , at some point in history , one of the most advanced cultures in the world .
It is fair to say that this creates an unprecedented breeding ground for cruel dictators , terror networks , fanaticism , incitement , suicide murders and general decline .
It is also a fact that almost everybody in the region blames this situation on the United States , on Israel , on Western Civilization , on Judaism and Christianity , on anyone and anything , except themselves .
A word about the millions of decent , honest , good people who are either devout Moslems or are not very religious but grew up in Moslem families :
They are double victims of an outside world , which now develops Islamophobia , and of their own environment which breaks their heart by being totally dysfunctional .
The problem is that the vast silent majority of these Moslems are not part of the terror and the incitement , but they also do not stand up political leaders , intellectuals , business people and many others .
Many of them can certainly tell right from wrong , but are afraid to express their views .
The events of the last few years have amplified four issues , which have always existed , but have never been as rampant as in the present upheaval in the region .
A few more years may pass before everybody acknowledges that it is a World War ,
but we are already well into it .
These are the four main pillars of the current World Conflict , or perhaps we should already refer to it as `` the undeclared World War III '' : against it . They become accomplices , by omission , and this applies to
*1 .
Suicide murders are not a new invention
but they have been made popular , if I may use this expression , only lately .
Even after September 11 , it seems that most of the Western World does not yet understand this weapon .
It is a very potent psychological weapon .
Its real direct impact is relatively minor .
The total number of casualties from hundreds of suicide murders within Israel in the last three years is much smaller than those due to car accidents .
September 11 was quantitatively much less lethal than many earthquakes
More people die from AIDS in one day in Africa than all the Russians who died in the hands of Chechnya - based Moslem suicide murderers since that conflict started .
Saddam killed every month more people than all those who died from suicide murders since the Coalition occupation of Iraq .
So what is all the fuss about suicide killings ?
It creates headlines .
It is spectacular .
It is frightening .
It is a very cruel death with bodies dismembered and horrible severe lifelong injuries to many of the wounded .
It is always shown on television in great detail .
One such murder , with the help of hysterical media coverage , can destroy the tourism industry of a country for quite a while , as it did in Bali and in Turkey .
But the real fear comes from the undisputed fact that no defense and no preventive measures can succeed against a determined suicide murderer .
This has not yet penetrated the thinking of the Western World .
The U.S. and Europe are constantly improving their defense against the last murder , not the next one .
We may arrange for the best airport security in the world .
But if you want to murder by suicide , you do not have to board a plane in order to explode yourself and kill many people .
Who could stop a suicide murder in the midst of the crowded line waiting to be checked by the airport metal detector ?
How about the lines to the check - in counters in a busy travel period ?
Put a metal detector in front of every train station in Spain and the terrorists will get the buses .
Protect the buses and they will explode in movie theaters , concert halls , supermarkets , shopping malls , schools and hospitals .
Put guards in front of every concert hall and there will always be a line of people to be checked by the guards
and this line will be the target , not to speak of killing the guards themselves .
You can somewhat reduce your vulnerability by preventive and defensive measures and by strict border controls but not eliminate it and definitely not win the war in a defensive way .
And it is a war !
What is behind the suicide murders ?
Money is , money and power and cold - blooded murderous incitement , nothing else .
It has nothing to do with true fanatic religious beliefs .
No Moslem preacher has ever blown himself up .
No son of an Arab politician or religious leader has ever blown himself up .
No relative of anyone influential has done it .
Would n't you expect some of the religious leaders to do it themselves , or to talk their sons into doing it , if this is truly a supreme act of religious fervor ?
Are n't they interested in the benefits of going to Heaven ?
Instead , they send outcast women , naive children , retarded people and young incited hotheads .
They promise them the delights , mostly sexual , of the next world , and pay their families handsomely after the supreme act is performed and enough innocent people are dead .
Suicide murders also have nothing to do with poverty and despair .
The poorest region in the world , by far , is Africa .
It never happens there .
There are numerous desperate people in the world , in different cultures , countries and continents .
Desperation does not provide anyone with explosives , reconnaissance and transportation .
There was certainly more despair in Saddam 's Iraq than in Paul Bremmer 's Iraq ,
and no one exploded himself .
A suicide murder is simply a horrible , vicious weapon of cruel , inhuman , cynical , well - funded terrorists , with no regard to human life , including the life of their fellow countrymen , but with very high regard to their own affluent well - being and their hunger for power .
The only way to fight this new `` popular '' weapon is identical to the only way in which you fight organized crime or pirates on the high seas : the offensive way .
Like in the case of organized crime , it is crucial that the forces on the offensive be united and it is crucial to reach the top of the crime pyramid .
You can not eliminate organized crime by arresting the little drug dealer on the street corner .
You must go after the head of the `` Family '' .
If part of the public supports it , others tolerate it , many are afraid of it and some try to explain it away by poverty or by a miserable childhood , organized crime will thrive and so will terrorism .
The United States understands this now , after September 11 .
Russia is beginning to understand it .
Turkey understands it well .
I am very much afraid that most of Europe still does not understand it .
Unfortunately , it seems that Europe will understand it only after suicide murders arrive in Europe in a big way .
In my humble opinion , this will definitely happen .
The Spanish trains and the Istanbul bombings are only the beginning .
The unity of the Civilized World in fighting this horror is absolutely indispensable .
Until Europe wakes up , this unity will not be achieved .
*2 .
Words can be lethal .
They kill people .
It is often said that politicians , diplomats and perhaps also lawyers and business people must sometimes lie , as part of their professional life .
But the norms of politics and diplomacy are childish , in comparison with the level of incitement and total absolute deliberate fabrications , which have reached new heights in the region we are talking about .
An incredible number of people in the Arab world believe that September 11 never happened , or was an American provocation or , even better , a Jewish plot .
You all remember the Iraqi Minister of Information , Mr. Mouhamad Said al-Sahaf and his press conferences when the US forces were already inside Baghdad .
Disinformation at time of war is an accepted tactic .
But to stand , day after day , and to make such preposterous statements , known to everybody to be lies , without even being ridiculed in your own milieu , can only happen in this region .
Mr. Sahaf eventually became a popular icon as a court jester ,
but this did not stop some allegedly respectable newspapers from giving him equal time .
It also does not prevent the Western press from giving credence , every day , even now , to similar liars .
After all , if you want to be an anti-Semite , there are subtle ways of doing it .
You do not have to claim that the holocaust never happened , and that the Jewish temple in Jerusalem never existed .
But millions of Moslems are told by their leaders that this is the case .
When these same leaders make other statements , the Western media report them as if they could be true .
It is a daily occurrence that the same people who finance , arm and dispatch suicide murderers , condemn the act in English in front of western TV cameras , talking to a world audience , which even partly believes them .
It is a daily routine to hear the same leader making opposite statements in Arabic to his people and in English to the rest of the world .
Incitement by Arab TV , accompanied by horror pictures of mutilated bodies , has become a powerful weapon of those who lie , distort and want to destroy everything .
Little children are raised on deep hatred and on admiration of so - called martyrs ,
and the Western World does not notice it because its own TV sets are mostly tuned to soap operas and game shows .
I recommend to you , even though most of you do not understand Arabic , to watch Al Jazeera , from time to time .
You will not believe your own eyes .
But words also work in other ways , more subtle .
A demonstration in Berlin , carrying banners supporting Saddam 's regime and featuring three - year old babies dressed as suicide murderers , is defined by the press and by political leaders as a `` peace demonstration '' .
You may support or oppose the Iraq war , but to refer to fans of Saddam , Arafat or Bin Laden as peace activists is a bit too much .
A woman walks into an Israeli restaurant in mid-day , eats , observes families with old people and children eating their lunch in the adjacent tables and pays the bill .
She then blows herself up , killing 20 people , including many children , with heads and arms rolling around in the restaurant .
She is called `` martyr '' by several Arab leaders and `` activist '' by the European press .
Dignitaries condemn the act but visit her bereaved family and the money flows .
There is a new game in town :
The actual murderer is called `` the military wing '' ,
the one who pays him , equips him and sends him is now called `` the political wing ''
and the head of the operation is called the `` spiritual leader '' .
There are numerous other examples of such Orwellian nomenclature , used every day not only by terror chiefs but also by Western media .
These words are much more dangerous than many people realize .
They provide an emotional infrastructure for atrocities .
It was Joseph Goebbels who said that if you repeat a lie often enough , people will believe it .
He is now being outperformed by his successors .
*3 .
Huge amounts of money , which could have solved many social problems in this dysfunctional part of the world , are channeled into three concentric spheres supporting death and murder .
In the inner circle are the terrorists themselves .
The money funds their travel , explosives , hideouts and permanent search for soft vulnerable targets .
The inner circles are primarily financed by terrorist states like Iran and Syria , until recently also by Iraq and Libya and earlier also by some of the Communist regimes .
These states , as well as the Palestinian Authority , are the safe havens of the wholesale murder vendors .
They are surrounded by a second wider circle of direct supporters , planners , commanders , preachers , all of whom make a living , usually a very comfortable living , by serving as terror infrastructure .
Finally , we find the third circle of so - called religious , educational and welfare organizations , which actually do some good , feed the hungry and provide some schooling , but brainwash a new generation with hatred , lies and ignorance .
This circle operates mostly through mosques , madrasas and other religious establishments but also through inciting electronic and printed media .
It is this circle that makes sure that women remain inferior , that democracy is unthinkable and that exposure to the outside world is minimal .
It is also that circle that leads the way in blaming everybody outside the Moslem world , for the miseries of the region .
The outer circle is largely financed by Saudi Arabia , but also by donations from certain Moslem communities in the United States and Europe and , to a smaller extent , by donations of European Governments to various NGO's and by certain United Nations organizations , whose goals may be noble , but they are infested and exploited by agents of the outer circle .
The Saudi regime , of course , will be the next victim of major terror , when the inner circle will explode into the outer circle .
The Saudis are beginning to understand it , but they fight the inner circles , while still financing the infrastructure at the outer circle .
Figuratively speaking , this outer circle is the guardian , which makes sure that the people look and listen inwards to the inner circle of terror and incitement , rather than to the world outside .
Some parts of this same outer circle actually operate as a result of fear from , or blackmail by , the inner circles .
The horrifying added factor is the high birth rate .
Half of the population of the Arab world is under the age of 20 , the most receptive age to incitement , guaranteeing two more generations of blind hatred .
Some of the leaders of these various circles live very comfortably on their loot .
You meet their children in the best private schools in Europe , not in the training camps of suicide murderers .
The Jihad `` soldiers '' join packaged death tours to Iraq and other hotspots , while some of their leaders ski in Switzerland .
Mrs. Arafat , who lives in Paris with her daughter , receives tens of thousands of dollars per month from the allegedly bankrupt Palestinian Authority , while a typical local ringleader of the Al-Aksa brigade , reporting to Arafat , receives only a cash payment of a couple of hundred dollars , for performing murders at the retail level .
*4 .
The civilized world believes in democracy , the rule of law , including international law , human rights , free speech and free press , among other liberties .
There are naive old - fashioned habits such as respecting religious sites and symbols , not using ambulances and hospitals for acts of war , avoiding the mutilation of dead bodies and not using children as human shields or human bombs .
Never in history , not even in the Nazi period , was there such total disregard of all of the above as we observe now .
Every student of political science debates how you prevent an anti-democratic force from winning a democratic election and abolishing democracy .
Other aspects of a civilized society must also have limitations .
Can a policeman open fire on someone trying to kill him ?
Can a government listen to phone conversations of terrorists and drug dealers ?
Does free speech protect you when you shout `` fire '' in a crowded theater ?
Should there be death penalty , for deliberate multiple murders ?
These are the old - fashioned dilemmas .
But now we have an entire new set .
Do you raid a mosque , which serves as a terrorist ammunition storage ?
Do you return fire , if you are attacked from a hospital ?
Do you storm a church taken over by terrorists who took the priests hostages ?
Do you search every ambulance after a few suicide murderers use ambulances to reach their targets ?
Do you strip every woman because one pretended to be pregnant and carried a suicide bomb on her belly ?
Do you shoot back at someone trying to kill you , standing deliberately behind a group of children ?
Do you raid terrorist headquarters , hidden in a mental hospital ?
Do you shoot an arch-murderer who deliberately moves from one location to another , always surrounded by children ?
All of these happen daily in Iraq and in the Palestinian areas .
What do you do ?
Well , you do not want to face the dilemma .
But it can not be avoided .
Suppose , for the sake of discussion , that someone would openly stay in a well - known address in Teheran , hosted by the Iranian Government and financed by it , executing one atrocity after another in Spain or in France , killing hundreds of innocent people , accepting responsibility for the crimes , promising in public TV interviews to do more of the same , while the Government of Iran issues public condemnations of his acts but continues to host him , invite him to official functions and treat him as a great dignitary .
I leave it to you as homework to figur out what Spain or France would have done , in such a situation .
The problem is that the civilized world is still having illusions about the rule of law in a totally lawless environment .
It is trying to play ice hockey by sending a ballerina ice - skater into the ring or to knock out a heavyweight boxer by a chess player .
In the same way that no country has a law against cannibals eating its prime minister , because such an act is unthinkable , international law does not address killers shooting from hospitals , mosques and ambulances , while being protected by their Government or society .
International law does not know how to handle someone who sends children to throw stones , stands behind them and shoots with immunity and can not be arrested because he is sheltered by a Government .
International law does not know how to deal with a leader of murderers who is royally and comfortably hosted by a country , which pretends to condemn his acts or just claims to be too weak to arrest him .
The amazing thing is that all of these crooks demand protection under international law , and define all those who attack them as `` war criminals , '' with some Western media repeating the allegations .
The good news is that all of this is temporary ,
because the evolution of international law has always adapted itself to reality .
The punishment for suicide murder should be death or arrest before the murder , not during and not after .
After every world war , the rules of international law have changed , and the same will happen after the present one .
But during the twilight zone , a lot of harm can be done .
The picture I described here is not pretty .
What can we do about it ?
In the short run , only fight and win .
In the long run , only educate the next generation and open it to the world .
The inner circles can and must be destroyed by force .
The outer circle can not be eliminated by force .
Here we need financial starvation of the organizing elite , more power to women , more education , counter-propaganda , boycott whenever feasible and access to Western media , internet and the international scene .
Above all , we need a total absolute unity and determination of the civilized world against all three circles of evil .
Allow me , for a moment , to depart from my alleged role as a taxi driver and return to science .
When you have a malignant tumor , you may remove the tumor itself surgically .
You may also starve it by preventing new blood from reaching it from other parts of the body , thereby preventing new `` supplies '' from expanding the tumor .
If you want to be sure , it is best to do both .
But before you fight and win , by force or otherwise , you have to realize that you are in a war , and this may take Europe a few more years .
In order to win , it is necessary to first eliminate the terrorist regimes , so that no Government in the world will serve as a safe haven for these people .
I do not want to comment here on whether the American - led attack on Iraq was justified from the point of view of weapons of mass destruction or any other pre-war argument , but I can look at the post-war map of Western Asia .
Now that Afghanistan , Iraq and Libya are out , two and a half terrorist states remain : Iran , Syria and Lebanon , the latter being a Syrian colony .
Perhaps Sudan should be added to the list .
As a result of the conquest of Afghanistan and Iraq , both Iran and Syria are now totally surrounded by territories unfriendly to them .
Iran is encircled by Afghanistan , by the Gulf States , Iraq and the Moslem republics of the former Soviet Union .
Syria is surrounded by Turkey , Iraq , Jordan and Israel .
This is a significant strategic change and it applies strong pressure on the terrorist countries .
It is not surprising that Iran is so active in trying to incite a Shiite uprising in Iraq .
I do not know if the American plan was actually to encircle both Iran and Syria , but that is the resulting situation .
In my humble opinion , the number one danger to the world today is Iran and its regime .
It definitely has ambitions to rule vast areas and to expand in all directions .
It has an ideology which claims supremacy over Western culture .
It is ruthless .
It has proven that it can execute elaborate terrorist acts without leaving too many traces , using Iranian Embassies .
It is clearly trying to develop nuclear weapons .
Its so - called moderates and conservatives play their own virtuoso version of the `` good - cop versus bad - cop '' game .
Iran sponsors Syrian terrorism ,
it is certainly behind much of the action in Iraq ,
it is fully funding the Hezbollah and , through it , the Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad ;
it performed acts of terror at least in Europe and in South America and probably also in Uzbekistan and Saudi Arabia
and it truly leads a multi-national terror consortium , which includes , as minor players , Syria , Lebanon and certain Shiite elements in Iraq .
Nevertheless , most European countries still trade with Iran , try to appease it and refuse to read the clear signals .
In order to win the war it is also necessary to dry the financial resources of the terror conglomerate .
It is pointless to try to understand the subtle differences between the Sunni terror of Al Qaeda and Hamas and the Shiite terror of Hezbollah , Sadr and other Iranian - inspired enterprises .
When it serves their business needs , all of them collaborate beautifully .
It is crucial to stop Saudi and other financial support of the outer circle , which is the fertile breeding ground of terror .
It is important to monitor all donations from the Western World to Islamic organizations , to monitor the finances of international relief organizations and to react with forceful economic measures to any small sign of financial aid to any of the three circles of terrorism .
It is also important to act decisively against the campaign of lies and fabrications and to monitor those Western media who collaborate with it out of naivety , financial interests or ignorance .
Above all , never surrender to terror .
No one will ever know whether the recent elections in Spain would have yielded a different result , if not for the train bombings a few days earlier .
But it really does not matter .
What matters is that the terrorists believe that they caused the result and that they won by driving Spain out of Iraq .
The Spanish story will surely end up being extremely costly to other European countries , including France , who is now expelling inciting preachers and forbidding veils and including others who sent troops to Iraq .
In the long run , Spain itself will pay even more .
Is the solution a democratic Arab world ?
If by democracy we mean free elections but also free press , free speech , a functioning judicial system , civil liberties , equality to women , free international travel , exposure to international media and ideas , laws against racial incitement and against defamation , and avoidance of lawless behavior regarding hospitals , places of worship and children , then yes , democracy is the solution .
If democracy is just free elections , it is likely that the most fanatic regime will be elected , the one whose incitement and fabrications are the most inflammatory .
We have seen it already in Algeria and , to a certain extent , in Turkey .
It will happen again , if the ground is not prepared very carefully .
On the other hand , a certain transition democracy , as in Jordan , may be a better temporary solution , paving the way for the real thing , perhaps in the same way that an immediate sudden democracy did not work in Russia and would not have worked in China .
I have no doubt that the civilized world will prevail .
But the longer it takes us to understand the new landscape of this war , the more costly and painful the victory will be .
Its understandable recoil from wars , following the horrors of World War II , may cost thousands of additional innocent lives , before the tide will turn .
Over a month ago , the experienced Iraqi politician Adnan Pachachi doubted Prime Minister Nouri Al - Malaki 's ability to carry out his promise to disband the armed militias and disarm them and said that Al - Maliki was in one corner and his government ministers , whether Shiites from the Al - Sadr movement and Al - Hakim 's group or Sunnis , were in another corner in terms of their allegiance to parties that have armed militias .
In fact , Pachachi 's conclusions are nothing new for the Iraqi situation that has reached the edge of a bottomless pit because of these militias whose existence the Iraqi man on the street can no longer tolerate as they have turned his life into a hell worse than the fire of Saddam 's Fedayeen and the bloody Hunin apparatus during the first chapter of dictatorship in the land of Mesopotamia .
And while Al - Maliki reached a new level of confrontation in his attack in parliament a few days ago when he denounced those he called " politicians during the day and pro-Saddam militias and terrorists at night , " Diri Al - Sadri who escaped an American raid to capture him is still active , and openly so , in his stronghold in Al - Sadr city some of whose residents boasted in a statement reported by the London newspaper Al - Hayat of what they called Abu Diri 's relations with officials who visit in order to get close to him .
Ali Al - Bideri said with pride , " Our area has become notorious and is being constantly visited by senior state officials who seek Abu Diri 's approval and pledge their obedience .
This has made people flock to his house in search of his mediation with them to empoy their unemployed children . "
These visits , according to this proud citizen , Al - Bideri " are not just by Iraqi state officials but also by foreigners from an Islamic state " which is , of course , Iran .
Phobias occur in both genders in the ages ranging between twenty and thirty years old ; they very rarely occur in adolescents .
Also , no cases have been recorded among children ; they rarely occur in children .
Nervous phobias usually happen at night , with the patient waking up with fast and pounding heartbeats , and feeling as if he were suffering a heart attack because of the chest pains , profuse sweating , and abnormal heart activity that accompanies fear and strong panic attacks .
The most common kind of phobia is the fear of high places and areas -LRB- Acrophobia -RRB- .
Fear of heights is the most common type of phobia .
A patient could be subject to losing his balance and then falling .
So any healthy person is advised not to insist that an acrophobic accompany him to high places , as he does not feel the extent of his pain and emotion , and both might get hurt .
Airplanes , in addition to skyscrapers , are among the causes of this phobia , as well as high rides in amusement parks , mountains and roads overlooking slopes or bridges .
A person does not necessarily have to be in a high place to experience the symptoms of this phobia .
It is enough for him to see , for example , a skyscraper to immediately have the symptoms , even if he is safe on the ground .
We had never seen , we had never experienced , we had never read of , and we had never heard of a Saudi , whether secular or liberal , modernized or enlightened , or even a communist or atheist , who writes and deals with ideas , whether he is young or old .
We never heard about any of those who confronted the state or carried a rifle and a bomb and adopted the policy of bombing and terrorism to change the status of the state , or acted barbarically and broke his pen to carry a stick instead , and confined the thoughts of others with it in order to lead a change by his hand , instead of by his ideas .
The Islamic movement does not lack ideas to confront others , if it is truly honest in adopting angelic Islamic thoughts .
Besides , it is shameful and wrong to describe an Islamic movement as an empty cart causing noise , or to say that its mind is so narrow that its tongue expanded .
The issue is bigger than this .
That is why we have a right to ask : Why then did the minds of those people go astray ?
Here I do not favor one movement over another , rather I describe reality , and bring it to our collective memory , so it can be a witness against those people .
The truth , which we should not ignore , and which answers that question , indicates that their ambition goes beyond denying the reprehensible , having correct beliefs , and preaching the only sect - it goes much beyond that .
In short , their goal is the seat of power , to which they want to appoint their caliph someday .
In short , their goal is to return to the Islamic caliphate , which is their dearest and most precious wish .
That means , in any case , the destruction of Al Saud dynasty as a start , then electing one of their sheikhs to be the awaited caliph .
The Western man , when he sits and listens to news reports or political or controversial speeches , he submits the information to his mental kitchen or what is called feedback in order to be able to draw out the essence and truth from it and to relegate embellishments to oblivion , or ignorance and ridicule ,
These are catchphrase lies or , if we want to be honest , the mental demeaning of the intellect of the listener or recipient of the information .
This is what differentiates the western man from the eastern man who has gotten used to not exerting his mind and using his mind with analysis and critique .
Given that he lives in a consumer society , he has no productive capacity left ,
why would he use the productive capacity bestowed on him by God ?
And indeed he does not possess any production incentives .
He carries what he is programmed to memorize and he repeats , and on many occasions he does not understand .
This is the paradox between a productive society exemplified by the West and the consumer society represented by the East .
And this is what has led both enemies and friends to call on psychologists and philosophers to formulate the slogan so that it is compatible with emotion and possesses the power to pierce the heart without exhausting the mind .
Based on this , we have reached the state in which we now live , in the midst of stagnation , bearing its load .
The Muslims in their early history did not designate a day to lay work aside .
This is why some scholars considered taking Friday off a kind of imitation of the unbelievers , because they are accustomed to leaving work on their weekly holiday , like Saturday for Jews and Sunday for Christians .
It has become common in the Islamic world to take off from official and semi-official work , such as in companies , on Friday .
The excuse for taking off on Friday was that one would be free for Friday prayers .
That is why it has become an acceptable custom , and this distances it from the comparison that Friday is the Muslims ' weekly holiday .
God guided this community to this day and led it away from Jews and Christians .
Jews have Saturday , and Christians have Sunday .
But when the imitation sickness intensified in the Islamic community , their ways of taking on the attitudes of unbelieving people diversified .
Some of them made the weekend Saturday and Sunday , like Jewish and Christian countries .
This is the ugliest type of imitation in this matter .
And some of them made the weekend Friday and Saturday .
I do not think anyone made the weekend three days .
And some of them were satisfied to imitate the number of days of the weekend , so they made the week 's holiday on Thursday and Friday .
This is the lesser evil among them .
There are many evils in long holidays ; this is not the place for detailing them , and God knows better .
Peace be upon our Prophet Mohamed , his family , and companions .

[jingzhe19] However , the post of driving on a snowy day reminds me again of the story of Hua Xin and Wang Lang in the New Anecdotes of Social Talk .
[jingzhe19] The two guys was fleeing for life in a carriage , when they met a hitch hiker on their way .
[jingzhe19] Hua Xin was hesitant and reluctant , but Wang Lang said it was fine to carry him as there is still a seat on the carriage .

[jingzhe19] After the guy got on , the carriage was chased by bandits .
Wang Lang was scared and wanted to drop the guy to reduce the load of the carriage .

ZT Han Han : Car Knowledge and Manifestation of Life -LRB- Regarding the car accident involving that beautiful/talented Taiwanese girl -RRB-

Title : ZT Han Han : Car Knowledge and Manifestation of Life -LRB- Regarding the car accident involving that beautiful/talented Taiwanese girl -RRB-
Poster 's Site : mitbbs.com BBS -LRB- Wed Jan 31 11:16:04 2007 -RRB-
A few days ago , another Taiwanese star passed away .
I had never heard of her .
I hear she was a talented beauty .
What a great pity !
The accident was a car crash .
Much of the entertainment news denounced that +her car 's front airbag failed to release , which caused the death .
In fact , the MINI COOPER she was riding in is not what the reports said .
It is the car with the highest safety index .
It is sold for 190,000 HK dollars in Hong Kong .
Polo also sells for more than 140,000 HK dollars .
It 's just a cute little car , preferred by girls .
But safety is surely not too big of a problem .
The collision happened on the side and rear .
So , the side airbag and air curtain were fully opened .
They opened at the time of first collision with the protective fence .
The first collision was with the protective fence only , and the impact on the people was very small .
In addition , there was the protection of the air curtain .
So , there would surely not be a big problem .
The real fatal collision was the second one from the tailgating truck .
At that time , all the airbags were already deflated .
There was no protective effect .
Furthermore , the force of this one was extremely large .
If the car had been stopped at an angle , then the head of the person sitting on one side would surely have hit the glass or the B column .
Meanwhile , there would not have been too much of a problem for someone on the other side .
This is common knowledge .
Then it came down to who had the bad luck of sitting on the side of the car that was angled out .
It was perfectly correct for the front airbag not to open , because the front of the car was not damaged at all .
None of the sensors received any signal of a collision .
Just imagine , this was a rear collision .
The people went backward abruptly .
Their bodies could have been supported by the seats , but the impact on their necks and heads was tremendous .
When they went abruptly backward , any additional misfortune of the front airbag opening for no reason would have eliminated any chance of survival .
So , of all the cars in the world , even a Rolls - Royce , the front airbag will not open during a rear collision .
If the front airbag opened after being tailgated , that would be a quality problem , and would be extremely dangerous .
The safety airbag 's eruption could knock someone to death .
So , infants are strictly forbidden from sitting in the front seat .
That was how the whole accident took place .
The result of the accident investigation division will not be different from this .
For this kind of accident , conclusions can be drawn from a single glance at the car wreckage .
The car and the car manufacturer have no fault .
All of the car 's passive safety protections had already fully carried out their functions .
So , it is extremely ridiculous and unscientific to blame and suspect the car and the car manufacturer for such an accident .
In particular , speculation about why the front airbags did not open was very amateurish .
Only by not opening would it have been correct .
If they had opened , her assistant might still be lying in the hospital .
If an accident occurs on the freeway , please get out of the car and leave immediately if you can move .
Many freeway accidents occur simply because people stay inside the car and sort out their thoughts , following which there is a fatal crash from a car following behind .
About death , I have always believed that they do not leave the world .
They only leave the human world .
They are surely sharing the same world with us , with a different manifestation of life .

What type of skin fits for beautification ?
Beauty Lover
-- Shock treatments can easily make you hypersensitive ; for getting rid of blemishes it 's best to go to the hospital .
In the public 's eyes , the beauty industry has always been both praised and blamed : on the one hand , it meets everybody 's demand for beauty , but on the other , after much major work on the face , many people feel that the results are limited , and in extreme cases the result is n't beauty but disfigurement .
Why is this ?
In the view of clinical dermatologists , the results at beauty salons are not obvious and there may even be problems .
In fact because not only is the consumer unlucky , not choosing the right beauty salon , but to a great extent this is determined by whether they choose the right occasion for beautification and understand the results .

Guo Kai 's Economic Notes : Your uncle is just your uncle .
Guo Kai 's Economic Notes
This morning I went to the supermarket with Dad , and when it came time to check out I discovered something that everybody probably knows : not everybody buys the same things .
Of course this is a no - brainer , but this is actually a major problem faced by me and many other people whenever we discuss economic issues or economic phenomena .
Most of the time , economic policy and economic theory are not aimed at individuals .
In terms of probability , if you explain the behavior of a specific individual , for example your uncle , using any economic theory , the probability that it will be accurate is virtually 0 .
In fact , in the great majority of cases the economic theory is aimed at an entire group , or a subgroup .
In terms of averages , accuracy is the goal of many economic theories -LRB- here I 'm being inaccurate ; I hope the experts will not take it too literally , especially those with IO expertise -RRB- .
But with regard to an ordinary person , he may never see the whole group , he sees only his co-workers , his relatives and his friends , the group of people familiar to him ; add up all the people in this group and they may number 200 , and that is already a lot of people .
Below I am going to refer to these 200 people collectively as " his uncle . "
So whenever you discuss an economic theory with someone , the response of a perfectly ordinary person would be : My uncle is n't like that , so this theory is baloney .
In other words , everybody tends to mistake the part for the whole .
Here , mistaking the part for the whole is not derogatory ; it is a limitation of the human race itself ; you have it and I have it .
If Americans had learned not to mistake the part for the whole , they might not have made such a mess of the world .
I believe that they made such a complete mess of the Middle East to a very large extent because they applied their own common sense to understanding the Middle East , which is a completely different place from the United States .
On this issue , China does not have much basis for being self - congratulatory ; China 's rapid rise has even caused some people to have a sort of misconception - that whatever China does is right - and this is in fact a manifestation of narrow - mindedness .
Therefore I believe it is extremely important to recognize that one 's own knowledge has limitations .
We need to maintain a sufficiently open attitude toward things that do n't correspond to our common sense .
So just because every time your uncle goes to the supermarket he buys hog head meat does n't mean that we should immediately assume that any theory that does not predict people going to the supermarket will buy hog head meat is wrong .
When you feel other people are talking baloney , and what other people say does not correspond to your " common sense , " you should at the same time recognize that your uncle is only your uncle , he is not the whole world .

In Commemoration of Mao Zedong 's 113th Birthday , Large - scale Evening Gala " The Sun that Never Sets " Premieres in the Capital !
Teachers and students at colleges in the capital , in building a harmonious society , reminisce about the great man 's charisma .
------ " The Sun that Never Sets , " a Large - scale Evening Gala in Grand Commemoration of the 113th Birthday of Comrade Mao Zedong
Comrade Mao Zedong was a great Marxist , a great proletarian revolutionary , strategist , and theoretician .
He is China 's greatest patriot and national hero of recent times .
He was a great man of the times who led the Chinese people to completely change their own destiny and national image .
Mao Zedong is the pride of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation .
Mao Zedong transformed China and influenced the world as a great historical figure of the times .
Mao Zedong 's name , Mao Zedong 's spirit , and Mao Zedong 's thought will have increasing influence on China and the world .
Just as General Secretary Hu Jintao said : " In all times and under all circumstances , we must always hold high the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought . "
" The East is red , the sun has risen .
China has brought forth Mao Zedong .
He works for the people 's happiness .
He is the people 's great savior . "
A melody with infinite passion and vigor exuding from the hearts of hundreds of millions of people bounced and echoed in the sky above the earth , touching even more hearts and souls of those with different skin colors , flowing over countries with different cultures .
Just as MCOA says : whoever is the first to pay attention to Chairman Mao , whoever is the first to learn about Chairman Mao , whoever is the first to profoundly understand the essence of Mao Zedong Thought , whoever is the first to use Mao Zedong Thought and Mao Zedong Spirit to guide one 's actions and work will be the first to enjoy the benefits , the first to become strong , the first to be happy , the first to possess wealth , and the first to gain respect of the people .

The Story of Teeth -LRB- 6 -RRB-

Title : The Story of Teeth -LRB- 6 -RRB- .
Originating site : BBS Unknown Space -LRB- Thu Jan 25 21:38:45 2007 -RRB- .
I have kept the good habit of having my teeth cleaned ever since I knew it could claim my life if I abruptly go to clean my teeth after years of leaving them uncleaned .
After my still upright but " left - tilting " teeth crouched in my mouth safely and soundly for another two years , another revolution erupted half a year after I graduated and found a job .
The revolution could be said a rudimentary one , which made me decide eventually to eliminate all the betrayers and heretics in one action !.
The incident was caused by a molar .
The location of the tooth was just next to the broken wisdom tooth that led to my first visit to an American dentist .
For some unknown reason , when I was eating the other day , the tooth suddenly ached during the meal , and it was very painful .
Unexpected I heard a " crack " while I was eating , and part of the tooth fell off !.
I could not remember eating anything hard ?!.
I rushed to the dentist , who said root canal therapy upon seeing it , your dental nerve had come out !.
I did not know what root canal meant but thought the name was quite fancy .
It was after I began to receive it that I found it really painful !.
For example killing the nerves , and dealing with the dental crown ...
I asked the dentist then why my tooth broke .
After examining my 25 teeth , the dentist told me seriously that the teeth on the right side were somewhat " cross biting " due to the " parallel shift " of my teeth , such that the upper and lower right teeth were always against each other .
The wrong position had led to uneven abrasions , resulting in the broken tooth .
I asked what solutions are available ?
The dentist said " correction . "
Thus , three years after I ran away from the " brigand orthodontist , " I stepped into the orthodontist 's office again ...

Qingqing 20070107 .
bill shen
Cloudy , temperature approx. 2 degrees .
While Qingqing was rinsing her mouth for the second time last night , mom said : leaks air and leaks rain .
Qingqing was unhappy upon hearing that .
She pounded mom with her little fists .
Dad also scolded mom : you also leaked air and leaked rain while your permanent teeth grew in your childhood .
Qingqing looked at Mom with water in the mouth .
At last , she said to mom after spitting it into the basin : I meant to spew it on your head .
Dad praised Qingqing for being thoughtful : knowing what she should do .
Qingqing played in bed after waking up in the morning .
Dad yelled , but she would n't get up and wanted to play a little longer .
Dad looked at Qingqing and teased Qingqing : how come this kid opens her eyes while sleeping ?
How come this kid sounds like " enen " while snoring ?
Qingqing told dad : I am just teasing you .
After she got up and dressed , she would n't eat the red bean buns or red sticky rice congee prepared by dad .
Instead she asked for soaked biscuits and did drawings in the room after finishing .
After a simple lunch , Qingqing wanted to buy stickers at Jinsheng .
She bumped into grandma on her way and also saw a lost dog advertisement on a wire pole .
Dad read to Qingqing , and then we arrived at Jinrunfa by shuttle bus , but could n't find the stickers that Qingqing wanted .
We then went to Jinsheng , where we finally found them .
Dad bought four volumes : .
One for each of her two sisters .
One to be placed at Qingqing 's home and one at her kindergarten .
Qingqing arranged everything very well .
We got on the bus to dine out .
Mom asked Qingqing to make a choice : is the back of the bus empty or full .
Qingqing first chose " full . "
When it was almost there , Mom asked Qingqing to choose again , and Qingqing chose " empty . "
Qingqing said after getting off : I won .
Mom said : I intentionally let you win , otherwise you will lose .
Qingqing wanted to pee on the way , dad had to hold Qingqing to pee by the tree .
It was very cold , and dad tidied Qingqing 's pants quickly .
Qingqing wanted to play with the sticker after we arrived at the hotel .
Dad discussed conditions with Qingqing : dad will let you play if you eat well .
Qingqing agreed and began to play again .
Mom said she wanted to swap to another place , but dad wanted to let Qingqing stay longer in the sun .
Qingqing was so obsessed with playing that she would n't have dinner .
Dad had to put away Qingqing 's sticker book and asked Qingqing to eat well .
Qingqing said it was spicy and she would n't eat .
Mom promised to buy Qingqing white fungus broth later .
Qingqing became happy immediately and played on .
We walked home after eating , and Qingqing played in her own room after dinner .
Dad said it was time to sleep , but she would n't sleep until after she played for a while in bed .
She told dad that she wanted to take one book to the kindergarten .
Qingqing said today : the teacher said last time that she would repay the money she borrowed from me the next day , but she has not repaid yet .
Oh ! Grown - ups would n't live up to their words either .
Dad promised to remind the teacher for Qingqing .
I wish you all knew how good it made me feel to break bread and hoist a toast with you ; especially after having survived situations where I did n't even know if I was going to survive through the next five minutes .
do you have to lassoo it before you can hitch it up ?
It will be interesting to see how Cingular is going to hobble that up to force you to use their $ network $ .
It 's a wonder you can hobble around USENET .
They had to hitch a ride with another San Diego couple who took them directly to the border .
A set of bills in the House and Senate would , among other things , grant USPS greater flexibility to hitch its rate increases to inflation .
We can save her life if she hitches a ride from TN to CT with Scooby !
I could n't do that again , so I hoisted what was left of the antenna up to the top of my 35-foot tower , and trimmed the legs so that they would stay within the property line .
If one had good rapport with the coalsawdust , bread , or milk delivery truck driver , one could hitch up to the left side of the truck and be recognizable in their outside mirror , and get a boost back to school after lunch if running late -- as long as we did n't overly exploit the favour , or act goofy while doing so .
It would be easier for them to hobble to town with a broken leg than with a broken pantaloon .
Amira Hass , who has lived in Gaza , describes it as a prison that shames her people .

IanaCE but I do know how to shear a bolt or two .
BTW anyone who knows anything about Vietnam knows that there war crimes , just like in Iraq when Rumsfield we now know authorized the abuse of Iraqi prisoners in violation of international law and shamed all of America .

Now that Satriale 's has been demolished , Costeira has been using the Internet to hawk chunks of cast stone from the facade .
I must say that I get the urge every now and then to heap it right back these days to those same war supporters , but I do n't .
People hawk them on Yawkee way for a minimum of $ 150 .
There 's plenty of evil to go around , we do n't need to heap it all on Cheney .
One of the big effects of the American Revolution was that the French monarchy heaped even more debt upon itself , leading to the Estates-General being called in 1789 .
How do we harmonize this with the Shema , that & quot ; God is one ? & quot ;

It was n't a week later that she called the doctor , who inquired as to progress .

Mr. Mistery , Go up and inquire if it was 365 times with the same cow. & quot ;
I inquired about his health as I too thought it had been very bad but he said he was fine .
To inquire after his health , the king , the officials , the lords , the youths , the aristocrats , the householders , the businessmen , the town-folk , the country-folk , and thousands of other living beings came forth from the great city of Vaisali and called on the invalid .
However , many , many churches have social programs and if you are a member of one , you may want to inquire there .

With things , less is more ; sell as much as you want , as long as somebody will buy .
In fact , in a socialist country one can not act in that way .
In the area of profiting from commodities , there have been no systems in place and no legal provisions ever since the reforms , there is no last word on how many multiples of cost profits are allowed to be , or what percentage .
China 's self - sufficient , natural economy was not without any advantages .
At least it did n't try to reap large profits off its own people , now the exact opposite is the case .
A home appliance - whether you are Chinese or a foreigner , which regional category you fit in , whether you are a big city or a small city , whether you are a worker or a peasant - is always the same price .
Not knowing how much profit is in there , not caring who can afford it and who ca n't , these do not seem to be the principles of socialism .
And with farmers ' grain and rural products , if the country does n't wipe out agricultural taxes and does n't offer any subsidies , keeping on producing is a problem .
In order to improve the people 's living standards , the government -LRB- set things so that -RRB- grain is always the same price whether sold to big cities or to rich people .
With this kind of ratio in existence , in struggling areas trying for a comfortable life is very difficult .
This issue should attract the close attention of economists .
This type of exploitation can only push them further into destitution and will make their lives more difficult in the future .
They made donations , and society accepted their donations .
Supposing they experience hardships later in their lives , or if they fall ill , who will give donations for them or look after them ?
If our country had set up a mechanism to provide social security to the people in terms of livelihood , pensions , medical care , clothing and food , then it would be acceptable to take such donations of the poor , but have we set one up ?
What rationale is there in our not dealing with the extravagance and corruption of the bureaucrats , but actually accepting the donations of the poor ?
" One meal for the bureaucrats is a year 's worth of grain to the poor , " and even several years ' worth .
There can be no justification for us to ask the poor for donations .
The ordinary people simply do not know whether our bureaucrats , while they consume a year 's grain for a poor person at one meal , can eat it calmly , and can swallow it .
You could say that the =top social strata have been generous to foreigners and to foreign capital during the reform and opening - up .
In order to draw in foreign capital , we have given the foreigners an array of all sorts of dazzling preferential policies , whether they could be given or not , and also gave the foreigners far too much better treatment over our countrymen , allowing the foreigners to make money hand over fist during China 's reform and opening - up .
Records indicate that Mother Nature has meted out punishment to humankind on a total of three occasions during the last one - hundred years .
Two of these instances were in China .
One instance was the great flood of 1931 , in which in excess of 3.5 million people died in China .
The second instance was the 1976 Tangshan Earthquake , where over 250 thousand died .
More than 120 thousand people died in this current tsunami .
Although there is a diminishing trend to the number of casualties in these three disasters , the figure of 120 thousand is nonetheless alarming indeed .
Where the beaches of these countries were littered with human bodies , surprisingly there were no wild animal corpses to be found .
Some animals , including elephants , during the preceding few days had already taken to their heels and headed for the mountains .
And only after the tsunami was over did they come down to search for water .
Is this an accident ?
Run Taoyan tells us it is n't !
My home is in the plains to the south of Beijing , not a great distance away from Tangshan .
However , damage to buildings in the earthquake was not too serious .
In the days leading up to the Tangshan earthquake , horses , cows and sheep did not seek shelter , ducks and chickens stayed out of the coop - even mice crossing the road were a widespread phenomenon .
When she was alive , mother often said : " Joy comes never more than once but sorrows never come singly ! "
Women of her times , who have had their feet bound for a few days , are accustomed to troubles and tribulations .
Hardworking , enduring and having a higher IQ than me , she never went to school , hence illiterate , yet queerly , she could read out loud the entire Holy Bible .
She borne 11 children and took seven of them with her as refugees for several years , having nothing valuable on her , yet not a single one died .
She passed away in 1992 at an age of 91 .
How I wish mother could live till today to see today 's China .
This year marks the 30th anniversary of China 's economic reform , as well as the big day of the Beijing Olympic Games .
With two happy events arriving , any ill luck should have been turned into good luck .
Sadly feng shui is not on our side , and disasters are especially plenty .
Wen Jiabao has indeed been hardworking .
My salute to this mister .
Let 's put aside things like the snow disaster and focus on two : one being the Tibetan incident on March 14 , and the other of course being May 12 great earthquake in Sichuan .
Busyboys say the " eight " characters were against us .
Three , one and four add up to eight , five , one and two also add up to eight , and May 15 is 88 days away from the Olympics .
I 've discussed it here by borrowing from Germans ' crystal ball : once what 's ominous is spoken , things will turn auspicious .
Like the Great Tangshan Earthquake , the earthquake in Wenchuan , Sichuan , this time has rendered people as helpless as ants and caused enormous loss of human lives and property .
However , one issue not to be ignored is that loss is =particularly concentrated at schools and student casualties are =particularly heavy , which has become the biggest highlight of the earthquake .
The great earthquake of magnitude 7.8 has revealed the " jerry - built project " nature of school buildings .
We should say although the great earthquake could n't have been resisted , the " jerry - built projects " have further stabbed the wounds of the disaster victims , becoming another killer of the nation 's future blossoms .
Why has the strong earthquake disaster revealed the " jerry - built " phenomenon in our school building projects ?
In recent years , the country has invested heavily in education , especially in its effort to develop school buildings .
The slogan " the best buildings are schools " has also become the common understanding of local governments and competent education authorities .
People of all social circles have also contributed a lot of money and energy to the " Hope Project . "
Yet how come we have so few best - quality buildings ?
How come we have spent large sums of money , in exchange for a " jerry - built project " that brings irreparable losses to people 's lives and property ?
Marx strictly demarcated the boundary between scientific socialism and bourgeois humanitarianism , mercilessly discarding the humanitarianism of the capitalist class . Shrewdly noting that after scientific socialism had taken root , the key weakness of humanitarianism =bewitchment was in denying revolution , supplanting scientific socialism . While the Southern Weekend used the Wenchuan Earthquake as a pretext , dramatizing the horror and tragedy of the earthquake , to take the opportunity to beat the drum for bourgeois humanitarianism , saying , " The sound of the alarm was a wimpering , sobbing , but even more a call , calling for us to realize human dignity again , calling for us to realize value of life again . " As if our socialist New China has never placed importance on the " value of life " , and therefore needs this earthquake to " call for " us to " realize human dignity again " and " realize value of life again " !
In the socialist New China , naturally there is n't the " dignity " of landlord capitalist masters , even during the crackdown on counter-revolutionaries , the " value of life " of the counter revolutionaries was ruthlessly divested .
Instead there is the dignity of workers and the peasants not to be oppressed and exploited !
The value of life for workers and peasants is countless times higher now than compared with old society .
Secondly , Tencent brought the time and user dimensions together .
This so - called time refers to how at the start of the incident , after Tencent had promptly reported it , it launched a special contingency plan .
The company immediately made a decision to donate a million .
People were satisfied with the promptitude of their action .
Afterwards , Tencent also increased its donation to RMB 10 million in view of the development of the situation , becoming one of the Internet enterprises making the largest donations to the earthquake disaster area .
At the same time as this , each of Tencent 's main platforms began to call on web users to make donations , and the integration at the same time of Tenpay and Tencent 's welfare platform took place as a result of this .
Users could not only support the disaster zone by making donations ; they could also get published on Tencent 's platform by writing articles to express their own friendly wishes for the people of the disaster zone .
We need to integrate our marketing focus , seize opportunities in current events , and conduct our marketing as appropriate .
We need to lay stress on integrating and meeting the different needs that consumers have of our products .
Once again , Tencent has integrated all kinds of link - up methods .
This so - called " link - up " refers to how , at the same time that Tencent was calling for disaster relief , it was using all kinds of media to organize and publicize good people and good deeds to encourage more enterprises and individuals to do their utmost for the people of the disaster zone .
As both consortiums in Singapore will employ the technology to connect fiber optic cables to home , in the future Singaporean consumers will be able to enjoy high - speed Internet of up to 1 Gbps , which is 10 times faster than the current highest Internet speed .
Tender for network companies for Singapore 's next - generation national broadband network has recently closed .
The Infocomm Development Authority received proposals from two consortiums , one of which claims it could complete laying of the network two and a half years ahead of schedule .
The winning consortium can receive government grants of up to S $ 750 million .
As both consortiums will employ the technology to connect fiber optic cables to home , in the future Singaporean consumers will be able to enjoy high - speed Internet of up to 1 Gbps , which is 10 times faster than the current highest Internet speed .
OpenNet , a consortium led by Canadian company AxiaNetMedia , claims it could be two and a half years ahead of the timetable drafted by iN2015 , which means completing laying of the fiber optic network by June 2010 .
Investors of the OpenNet consortium include SingTel -LRB- 30 % -RRB- , Singapore Press Holdings -LRB- 25 % -RRB- and Singapore Power Telemedia -LRB- 15 % -RRB- .
The Wenchuan Earthquake wrought massive destruction on those in its path .
According to incomplete statistics , as of 7 pm on the 13th , 12,012 victims had died in the Sichuan quake zone , 9,404 people were buried in the rubble , 7,841 were missing , with 26,206 being treated in hospital .
In the blink of an eye , more than ten thousand souls bursting with life departed this earth forever , in the blink of an eye tens of thousands became trapped in the rubble .
For those who already died , we can but regret , can only grieve .
However , most distressing were those survivors still buried in the rubble .
Following the big quake was an accompaniment of aftershocks of varying sizes striking at random , along with stormy adverse weather conditions .
One could say that each aftershock , as far as those survivors were concerned , represented an extremely serious danger , an incredibly tough life ordeal .
It can be imagined what kind of desperate and anxious frame of mind those survivors buried under the rubble must have been in !
The world that they faced would have been a terribly dark world indeed !
In such circumstances as these , I can only offer up blessings , hoping beyond hope that those people still surviving can somehow get through it all safely .
We can only pray , pray that Heaven will open its eyes and protect those suffering countrymen .
We can only call out loudly inside our hearts : Earthquake victims hold on !
Operations of the US economy is much reliant on low oil prices .
In 2002 , international oil prices were at a level of about USD $ 25 a barrel .
In the low - oil - price era , oil spending of consumers only accounted for a relatively small proportion of their individual income .
Enterprises were able to invest and expand at a low cost .
That is to say in the low - oil - price era , America 's existing economic model was able to continue without large - scale technological revolution .
However , hedge funds would n't approve the model .
They executed a hedge trading strategy of creating two long positions : simultaneously long in Dow Jones and oil .
Their logic was that if oil prices fell , the US economy would prosper and the Dow Jones stocks would rise , the absolute value of which should be greater than the fall of oil prices ;
if oil prices rise , Dow Jones , which represented a production model that is the US 's most competitive and best able to overcome high oil prices , should fall at an absolute value smaller than the rise in oil prices .
This should be an always profitable hedge trading strategy -LRB- specific trading profits depend on the hedge ratio between Dow Jones and oil -RRB- .
In fact I used to write frequently about my wife .
She , of course , should be my girlfriend at that time , but in our minds we had long considered ourselves as husband and wife .
Days of triviality and helplessness frittered away much of my passion and fantasy .
I never had the desire to smile too often as time went by , and she was constantly concerned about my moodiness .
Yet , she never seemed to have any reservation in her effort and contribution .
In addition to taking care of me , an almost mentally sick man , she also had to budget carefully for this family , using our meager income to build up bit by bit a tiny sense of security and happiness .
She had never despised me for my poverty , nor had she ever asked anything from me .
At one time , she just longed to have a home we could call our own .
At that time buying a house was beyond my imagination .
Because of that , I once also suspected whether she had made too high a demand on me .
It made me very sad during that period .
However , I also knew that we indeed needed a home .
I also had the obligation to give her a home .
She came to this strange land for me , with no relatives or friends .
I should give her a place where she could be shielded from winds and rains .
It 's already the most dangerous third day into the Great Wenchuan Earthquake in Sichuan .
As of now , the officially confirmed death toll has exceeded 15,000 .
A great number of brothers and sisters are still buried under the debris or trapped in a dangerous situation .
Under the leadership and organization of the Party and the government , the entire nation are doing all they can in a concert effort to save their compatriots in disaster - hit areas .
Governments of different countries and their people are also extending humane care in various ways .
As China 's first and only full real - name blog site to date , blshe.com promptly issued an urgent initiative following the earthquake that asked on people to take part in earthquake fighting and disaster rescue through blogs .
Later , in conjunction with 10 major domestic blogging platforms including people.com.cn and joining hands with the Chinese Red Cross Society , it called on netizens and bloggers globally to donate .
These initiatives are positively responded to .
Blshe.com has not only become a key platform that publishes in real - time front - line stories about earthquake fighting and disaster rescue , it has also turned into a channel to raise money for disaster - hit areas .
The vast number of bloggers have donated either in their own name or within the framework of their local blogger associations .
Some have also helped disaster - hit areas contact donation targets and donating organizations , fully demonstrating their valuable consciousness to shoulder morality and righteousness .
In Sichuan province alone , more than four million buildings collapsed and were damaged in the earthquake .
Since May 12 , the millions of people who successively evacuated from the disaster areas in Sichuan were relocated to Chengdu , Deyang , Miaoyang , and their surrounding cities .
Most of them live in temporary tents or makeshift shelters .
Although their life for the short term is expected to have no big problems , after carrying out earthquake relief for one week , the long - term living arrangements for the disaster - stricken people have started to draw the attention of many parties .
As of now , there are n't many enterprises involved in producing tents in the two cities , only Susino Umbrella Co. , Ltd .
But there are a lot of enterprises that produce tent material .
Currently , warp - knitted or machine - knitted high - strength polyester fabric is mainly used as the base fabric for all the cloth that makes up the tents .
Between the two cities , the companies engaged in the production of polyester are mainly Chunhui Co. , Ltd and S - Yi Hua , among others .
As for the production of the temporary homes , materials needed for the construction will entirely be insulating , fireproof , recyclable and environmentally friendly .
Currently , the main producers of energy - saving building materials in the two cities are Shuang Liang Co. , Ltd , Yantai , Wanhua , BNBM , and so on .
After the establishment of new China , and in view of the two facets of the Chinese national bourgeoisie , who exploiting the workers to make a profit on one hand , and supporting the constitution as well as accepting socialist transformation on the other , the Chinese Communist Party formulated a policy to use , restrict , and transform capitalist industries and businesses ,
Through a series of transitional forms for state capitalism , ranging from low to high levels , and after taking into consideration China 's national conditions , the Party implemented " peaceful redemption " on capitalist owned means of production based on the visions of Marx and Lenin .
Through " buying , " the majority of these people were transformed into independent laborers ,
We have bought off a social class , and eliminated a private ownership system ,
A basic system of socialism was established in China .
A whole society showed a economic development upsurge centered on the " public " ,
The voice proclaiming that " we are not only good at destroying the old world , but also will excel in building a new world " was a most heroic one in those days .
The east and south slopes of Changbai Mountain are both on the North Korean side of the boundary , if you want to see lake Tianchi , you have to cross the border .
Originally , North Korea had not set up any border sentry posts on the edge of Lake Tianchi .
It was only after road construction progressed and the number of project labourers near the border gradually increased , that two North Korean border sentry posts were set up on the side of Lake Tianchi .
So people are not allowed to approach and cross the border at the edge of Lake Tianchi .
But , after all , China and North Korea are not enemies and it is still possible to cross over if you talk to the North Korean border guards .
A " token of appreciation " will be necessary .
We went through all sorts of hardship to see it .
Our hearts were in our throats as the labourer that we sent negotiated with the North Korean border guards
After several days of rushing about , if we did n't get to see it after arriving at the border , I think each of us would definitely feel extremely chagrined from our heart .
I prayed silently
Time went by minute after minute .
When the North Korean soldiers finally let us cross over , we were too excited to express how we felt .
Just because it was n't easy , when we got our first glimpse of Lake Tianchi , everybody excitedly let out a shout
Heaven in the end gave us faces and the weather also was pretty fair .
Because being able to see Lake Tianchi in this season totally depend on luck .
Most of the time it is cloudy and the lake ca n't be seen -LRB- Lake Tianchi 's color changes every moment .
It is really beautiful ! -RRB- .
Chinese - Canadian Member of Parliament Michael Chong resigned without hesitation from his position as a cabinet minister in the federal government because of a parliamentary vote on a bill regarding " Quebec as a single nation within the Canada territory " ,
On the 28th , the Chinese community and Chinese in the Conservative Party all praised his commitment to justice and principle as well as his morality , courage and demeanor in voicing his own viewpoint .
" I will not compromise on this principle , not now , and nor in the future . "
Michael Chong reckoned that a nation can not exist inside another nation -LRB- nation within nation -RRB- and that there should only be one country named Canada .
Michael Chong believed that his resignation will not be a serious blow to the Harper government .
" I have full confidence on the subject of the prime - minister and the government . "
Chong said that the government was moving in the right direction on issues such as accountability , crime and the economy and that he himself was still a loyal member of the Conservative Party .
Chinese - Canadian Civic Alliance Vice - President Dr. Huang Weizhong said that between political correctness and the principles of justice , Michael Chong 's choice to resign serves as a model for the Canadian political world .
It also communicates the orientation of the values of the Chinese community .
His resignation is not the result of a single incident .
Besides the Quebec issue being the direct cause , Michael Chong 's difference in opinion from that of the prime minister regarding the handling of Canadian - Chinese relations could also have been a cause .
Xu Xin also has a set of unique and secret standards for selecting people .
First , check if the entrepreneur has " business intuition . "
When Xu Xin first invested in Ding Lei of Netease , he was the first one to enter the SMS business and the first one to develop online games .
He could see the business opportunities that others failed to see .
He could persist while others gave it up .
He could retreat when all the others moved forward with the trend .
Second , what achievements the team has made and what major decisions it has gone through .
Third , the ability to lead a team , whether the entrepreneur has personal charisma and knows how to manage personnel .
With 10 people under him , the leader was still capable of management .
When the company expanded to 100 people , the leader was unable to manage and became a bottleneck instead .
To investigate this , Xu Xin would listen to the comments from his competitors and would observe his assistant .
If the assistant was very competent , and had followed him many years , this shows the leadership of this person is not bad .
Fourth , passion is a must .
Passion means the love for the enterprise .
The process of starting a business is always very tedious and difficult .
Without this passion , it is very hard to persevere nor stand out among millions of entrepreneurs .
Fifth , the character of the entrepreneur must be open , transparent , honest , and reliable .
With so much money handed over to him for management , could this not be taken into consideration ?
[] Ideological differences between the US and China do not seem to be as big as those between the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War .
[] Foreign capital invested in mainland China last year reached a number as high as 72.4 billion US dollars , much of which came from the US .
This data shows that the previously disintegrated world is now closely intertwined and inseparable .
However , the distinctions between the US and China are still crystal clear .
[] In the past five years , the US launched wars in Afghanistan and Iraq .
In contrast , China 's current strategy is to avoid conflict as much as possible .
[] Hu Jintao values peace , aiming simply for the annual 10 % economic growth in mainland China .
[] China neither exports wars nor does it export development models and political blueprints .
[] China only wants to do business , and avoids causing destruction to others .
[] Seen from China 's eyes , democracy is far less important than economic growth .
[] China thinks that as long as the economy grows , most problems will be resolved along the way .
[] The uni-polar world which the US has dominated for 17 years is finally coming to an end .
[] At present , we only see the US knocking at the gate of China with reverence and awe .
Bush also calls China " a very important nation . "
[] Meanwhile , the Iraq situation is proving , in , that the abilities of the almighty US are not limitless .
The " Heron " -LRB- Heron -RRB- Unmanned Aerial Vehicle is a new Israeli Medium Altitude Long Endurance UAV system model , equipped with automatic takeoff and landing functions , and capable of penetrating target areas for deep reconnaissance or carrying out extended patrols in designated areas .
It can send information obtained back to ground control in real time using a data link .
It can also allow war zone headquarters or grass - roots units to access the results of UAV reconnaissance in real time .
The new " Heron " -LRB- Heron -RRB- UAV shown in the latest promotional video in a recent aviation exhibition can carry a mission payload up to 250 kilograms ,
Because of its feature of a capacity for extended patrol flights , depending on the different natures of tasks , it can also be used as an airborne communications relay station .
When it carries the SAV system , it can obtain high resolution ground reconnaissance images in real time .
For civilian purposes , it can be used for search and rescue missions , locating sunken vessels or vehicles involved in accidents .
If you have money , there 's no need to talk about it .
But among the working class , if a couple 's basic monthly salary was greater by just one thousand or so , the pressure from a mortgage would definitely be a lot less .
In addition , mortgage procedures are becoming increasingly simple and the conditions are also favorable .
Of course , this means to push up housing prices .
My parents have discussed with me whether they should quickly haul out their savings to buy a house .
It 's because my mother says that money is becoming more worthless over the time , especially for the working class like them whose primary income is the salary .
My parents have a few properties and have only rented out one house for business use .
Nowadays , the rent one gets by renting out a house is not high either , so they are n't expecting to earn much from the rent , but rather are hoping the properties will maintain their value .
If they want to buy another property now , they will definitely have to borrow from the bank .
I think perhaps they should wait until next year when housing prices tumble .
Then it will be relatively worthwhile .
Does anybody think that housing prices could fall next year ?
I was not selected , I needed money , but unfortunately I did n't get this part - time job .
I was n't even selected for a part - time job of just eating instant noodles .
She was not selected , poor her , it seems that her boyfriend would be snatched away by Yun .
On the stage , he would be Romeo , and Yun would be Juliet , the leading actress of the Chinese department .
She had to sit in front of the stage , looking at him and Yun to play out the vicissitudes of life and the sorrow of lingering .
She would not resign to , I needed money ,
I said : Give me the money , and I will take care of that for you .
I guarantee you would sit in front of the stage , and watch the good drama , with him .
I got into the line once again , gazed by surrounding curious eyes .
Because except the judges , I was the only female there .
I was the only female competing with so many guys for acting the role of Romeo .
I had already lost one part - time job , I could not lose the second one .
I was so desperate , acting out Romeo 's struggle before he stabbed himself with a dagger , calling out in my heart : money , money , money , though what came out of my mouth was Juliet 's name .
Same desperation , same helplessness .
Celebration Shooting Turns Wedding Into a Funeral in Southern Gaza Strip
Asad
1/20/2007
Gaza - UPI
The cheers and hails of happiness at a wedding in Khan Younes in the southern Gaza Strip turned into screams and moans of pain after one of the celebrators lost control of his weapon , from which a number of bullets were released that killed the groom 's brother and hit three other relatives of his , turning the wedding into a funeral in moments .
A medical source at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younes told United Press International that Palestinian citizen Kamal Mohamed Al Bashiti -LRB- 33 years old -RRB- died shortly after he was hit by a gunshot in the chest from an accidental shooting at his brother 's wedding in Khan Younes .
Three other relatives of his were also injured in the accident , including two children .
Gaza Strip residents are suffering from the problem of aggravation from the weapons mess and security chaos resulting from the intense spread of weapons in the hands of security agency individuals and members of factions and families .
This is a common practice that claimed the lives of about 350 people last year , according to Palestinian human rights sources .
Mohamed Al Bashiti , 18 -LRB- years old -RRB- , a relative of the victim , mentioned that while the young men were performing dances and popular dabke dances Thursday evening , and while they were in a state of intense rejoicing for the wedding of our relative , Majed Al Bashiti , one of the armed men lost control of his weapon , which he was trying to use to fire to celebrate and greet the groom .
The bullets went astray and hit a number of participants amid a state of panic and terror .
In moments , the wedding cheers turned into screams and the hitting of cheeks .
The participants of the party moved to Nasser Hospital , which lay hundreds of meters away from the site of the wedding .
The tragic news came after a little while : the death of the groom 's brother , who works in one of the security agencies .
An elderly man said , " I asked them not to shoot and asked them for God 's sake not to do it , but they persisted in it , until what happened happened .
A number of women suffered cases of fainting and shock after the tragic accident . "
Some Palestinians are used to shooting in the air during their celebrations , especially weddings , as an expression of their happiness , in spite of the repeated warnings the Ministry of Interior has launched to chase those who take part in this practice .
But the warnings were limited to announcements after each incident , without translating into actual procedure in reality .
A researcher at the Palestinian Center for Human Rights , Yasser Abd Al Ghafoor , said this is not the first time victims have fallen in similar incidents , noting that the rights organizations observed several incidents in which victims fell and injuries occurred during wedding and celebration gunfire , one of the common misuses of weapons in the Gaza Strip .
The city of Khan Younes had witnessed on the third of last July a similar incident , when the girl , Amani Al Raqab , died by a bullet that hit her by mistake from a revolver her brother was shooting off on his wedding day .
Pendant of Soldier in Golan Since 1967 War Found
The Cold of the North
Gaza - Dunya al - Watan .
Students at schools of the Qisrin settlement found the pendant of a Syrian soldier south of the occupied Syrian Golan .
On the pendant was written the name of the soldier , Mahmoud bin Ali , and his military serial number M 16241 .
He was a Muslim , and his blood type was A+ .
The two students , Alexander Ghuliyandrin and Oleg Darutsigh , said that they were on a trip last Saturday morning when they reached a military fortification near Qisrin .
It was obvious that man 's foot had not stepped on this place for a long time ago .
The two students entered the fortification where they found old medical equipment and a number of military helmets and a canteen , as well as a military pendant covered with mud and very dirty .
The two students took the pendant home with them and cleaned it and washed it .
They were surprised that it did not belong to an Israeli soldier because the writing on it was in Arabic and they did not understand anything that was written on it .
The two students took the pendant with them to school on Sunday and tried to consult the teacher to find out what was written on it .
It turned out that it belonged to a Syrian soldier whose name was Mahmoud bin Ali .
His military serial number was 16241 , and the writing also indicated that he was a Muslim and his blood type was A+ .
A senior officer in the Israeli army who fought in the Golan during the June War as well as in the October War , said that from the descriptions of the place and the fortification given by the two boys , they go back to the war of June 1967 , because the Syrian army did not establish fortifications south of the Golan during the October War .
The officer added that the presence of the pendant in the place together with medicines and medical equipment indicates that the soldier was injured , and it is probable that his fate is still unknown to his family and relatives and no one knows what happened to him .
The strange thing is that the Arab and Syrian media are kept oblivious of these news stories which are concerned with the prisoners and soldiers lost in that war .

Abu Dilama
Google is broadcasting a new video recording of Saddam 's corpse after his execution .
A new video recording depicting the corpse of the late Iraqi president Saddam Hussein after his execution on the morning of the first day of the Eidul Adha was broadcasted Monday evening on the Google Internet website .
The video shows Saddam Hussein lying covered on a stretcher whilst the camera closes on him .
Then the covering is removed from his face which has traces of blood on it in addition to a deep wound on his neck .
The video also plays voices of those next to the corpse speaking to each other .
One of them says " quickly " apparently asking the person who is filming to do it quickly .
Someone is calling to another man in a loud voice saying .. " Abu Ali , Abu Ali .. you will be responsible " for the matter " before the tone of his voice starts to rise in a way suggesting that he is under pressure because the filming is taking too long .
The clip does not last longer than half a minute and is the second one being broadcast unofficially on the Internet following the film taken on a mobile phone last week which recorded the execution of Saddam and depicted insults and repeated Shiite slogans by those who attended his execution .

Abd al - Bari Atwan : -LRB- President Saddam -RRB- Great in His Life .. Great in His Martyrdom
Asad
1/02/2007
This unprecedented Arab and international interest in the execution of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and the barbaric way in which it was carried out , confirms the importance of the man , his prominent status , and his distinguished role in the history of the Arab region .
The American administration , who planned carefully for this event through experts in media and public relations , and its tools in Iraq and the inclinations of public opinion did not at all expect such an opposite result , which along with the destructive consequences that may result from it in the coming days have caught them by surprise .
Saddam Hussein proceeded to the gallows like a proud mountain , with head raised , standing upright , looking down at the insignificant things and insignificant people , believing in his creed and his Arabism , repeating slogans of pride and dignity , after he confirmed his faith .
He confirmed it by repeating verses from the noble Koran and the two testimonies .
He will be envied by all Arab leaders , both living and dead , for this honorable martyrdom , and this enormous love in the midst of hundreds of millions of Arabs and Muslims all over the different parts of the world .
Saddam Hussein was the only leader in the modern history of this nation who went to the guillotine because he was a patriot who refused occupation and surrender to the invasion , and chose resistance .
The only ones who preceded him in this honor were men like Umar al - Mukhtar and Yusuf al - Azma , by whose struggle the nation and its history were honored , and kept it for them in the records of pride and dignity .
They hastily executed him because they feared him even when he was behind bars , just as they will still fear him as a corpse hidden under the soil of the homeland , and comparisons between his time and their bloody and chaotic time always came in his favor , and the calls for his return to save Iraq from its crisis and the corrupt and malicious gang that governs it have become deafening to the ears of the occupation and its accomplices .
He embarrassed them and dwarfed them by standing as a spear in the prisoner 's dock .
They were terrified by the penetrating looks of his eyes .
They were exposed by his patriotism and Arabism and his contempt for the odious sectarian divisions that they planted in their contaminated new Iraq .
So they decided to get rid of him with a confused and embarrassing hastiness .
Thanks to the technology of the mobile phone which enabled us to recognize the ugly face of the hateful sectarianism that is governing in America 's Iraq .
This tape exposed the government of the Green Zone , and blew up all the plans for censorship and fraud by the experts of the American Intelligence service and their agents .
It presented us with the naked truth , without that being the intention of its owner .
He was right when he turned to them and said , " Are these your men ? " when they were directing insults at him while he was proceeding to the gallows in magnanimity and with self - respect , repeating the noble words , " and when the ignorant address them they say ' peace . ' "
Is it manliness to shout hateful sectarian slogans in front of a man who has never been sectarian , and the rope of the gallows is being wound around his neck , and his soul will go to its Creator in a few seconds ?
Are these the tolerant ethics of Islam ?
Are these the values of Arabism , decency , and pride ?
Are those the sons of the great Iraq which had always stood up against invaders throughout history and was a pillar of support for its nation and the causes of justice in the world as a whole ?
We are sorry , but not surprised , because some Arab governments objected only because the execution took place on the day of the feast of Bairam , as if the execution of this man would have been permissible and blessed on any other day .
We are sorry again because most of the Arab leaders hid in their palaces and none of them dared to speak even one word of protest out of fear of America .
We were stabbed twice , first when we watched an Arab leader being led to the gallows in accordance with sectarian justice which is spiteful and vengeful . And the second time when we did not see anyone among the club of leaders to which he belonged for more than 30 years object to his execution .
Maybe God wanted a good end for him , and a good reputation , when He induced one of them to record what America and the government of sects wanted to hide , by means of the video of the last moments , which created a historic turning point that will perhaps shape the history of the region , and the nature of events in it for decades to come .
Maybe God wanted to expose the series of lies of Muwaffaq al - Rabi the National Security Advisor in the government of occupation . -LRB- Where is that security ? -RRB- , who went out to the world saying that he , meaning President Saddam , was weak and collapsing while he was on his way to meet his God .
Then the tape comes along and shows us with sound and image that we are in front of a courageous lion , who refuses to wear the mask , just as he refused to take the tranquilizing pills they offered him .
Why the mask , and why the pills ?
The mask is for traitors and criminals who are ashamed of their treason or their crimes , and the tranquilizing pills are appropriate for those who can not face history because of their bad deeds .
The American administration committed a fatal mistake and revealed a major foolishness to be added to its many foolishnesses in Iraq when it executed this man , in a way for which it will pay a hefty price in the near future .
His survival would have benefited it much more than his execution if they understood politics as they should , because his survival could have been a card to threaten the sectarians and keep them as servants to them and their schemes , just as it could have been a bargaining chip for calming down the resistance and the broad Iraqi sector which supports it .
But they do not know anything except grudges , and they do not want anything other than inflicting more degradation on the Arabs and Muslims by his execution .
Perhaps the American administration will have succeeded in one thing only , intentionally and with planning or without it , namely , deepening the sectarian breach not only in Iraq but in the Islamic world as a whole .
It was not by coincidence that Nouri al - Maliki signed the decision to carry out the execution .
And it was also not a matter of coincidence that the task of carrying it out was assigned to spiteful sectarians as we have seen in the videotape .
Al - Talabani hid or fled , along with all those who participated in the project of the American occupation and gave it a legitimate cover , from the other sect .
This execution will deal a strong blow to all the efforts of national reconciliation .
It will lead to the escalation of attacks against the American forces and those cooperating with it .
It will pour more oil on the fire of the civil war that has already been kindled .
Those who carried out the death sentence do not want reconciliation or to maintain a unified Iraq .
Rather , they are working to blow it up ; tolerance , forgiveness , and patience are basic characteristics not found in those people .
Saddam had negative traits and positive traits , but he was not killed because of his negative traits , but rather because of his positive traits , which were his belief in Arab unity , resistance to the enemies of the nation , building an unprecedented industrial and educational foundation , and challenging America .
He chose resistance and rejected safe and luxurious exile .
The curse of Saddam will continue to chase them , chase the Americans , and chase his spiteful sectarian executioners .
Just as Al - Qaeda emerged from the womb of Israeli arrogance in Lebanon and American arrogance in Iraq , Saddam 's Al - Qaeda will emerge from the womb of the degrading execution process .
