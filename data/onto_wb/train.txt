Even I get tired of arguing about tax hikes .
For a change of pace , I invite you to contemplate the hazard posed by that old computer monitor sitting in your basement or the pre-big screen TV collecting dust in your garage .
They contain toxic chemicals --
do n't dump them in the trash !
Be responsible and unload them at one of 18 electronics recycling events scheduled in Virginia this April .
If landfilled or incinerated , hazardous materials in common electronic products may be released into the soil , air or water .
Televisions and computer monitors use cathode ray tubes -LRB- CRTs -RRB- , each of which contain as much as 8 pounds of lead .
Flat screen TVs and monitors contain mercury .
Printed circuit boards and switches in electronic devices contain small amounts of chromium , cadmium , mercury and lead .
'' Almost seventy - five percent of all obsolete electronics are still stored in offices and homes . This is a great opportunity to get rid of that old PC or VCR that has been collecting dust and know it will be responsibly reused or recycled , '' said Computer Recycling Initiative 's Director , Carrie Dorsey .

Good idea .
I 'd feel a lot better about it if the stuff did n't wind up going to China and being `` recycled '' in a manner that is environmentally unfriendly .
It 's kind of like the Oregon soft drink cans .
Turns out they were being ground up and turned into substrate for leaching gold : a pretty nast process .
Darn , they are n't hitting Spotsy .
I 've got two dead monitors taking up space in my office .
Jim , on behalf of the Virginia Recycling Markets Development Council and the Mid-Atlantic Consortium of Recycling and Economic Development Officials -LRB- MACREDO -RRB- , thanks for plugging e-cycling .
Such events are becoming more frequent and more convenient to more Virginia residents , although based on cod 's comment , we still have a ways to go .
A well - used economic development tool is the incubator , typically an office building that is subdivided and provides subsidized rent and admin services to small business that have outgrown their garage or bedroom , but are too small for leased space .
These incubators typically cater to high tech or `` clean '' service businesses .
I have always thought we should consider setting up recycling `` incubators '' at landfills and transfer stations .
E-waste and construction waste are two potentially profitable steams
and nurturing small recycling businesses might serve both an economic development good and a public good .
A person with a pick - up truck could start such a business pretty easily .
The cost of a trailer or two and a covered space would probably be much less than equivalent office space .
If we stimulated home - grown markets , we might not send so much to China , although I suppose anything we can do to curb the trade deficit might be considered a good thing in some quarters .
That 's right .
I know a guy who gets surplus building materials sorts and resells it .
I 've bought quite a bit from him
and he apparently does a good business .
The business itself is somewhat trashy looking .
It appears that it is located on part of an old family farm ,
and the nearby houses are ones that have been spun off to family memebers .
But if anybody else tried to duplicate it , I ca n't think of anyplace in my county where it would be allowed , or else the requirements would be so onerous it could n't survive .
In my home town , they once built an entire tanker truck for the fire department , out of stuff that came from the dump .
We had really low taxes .
The dump had well organized recycling areas located around the central landfill pit ,
and people had a good eye for things that others might want .
Recycling is a really good idea ,
but it is hard to make it pay ,
and it has a waste stream of its own .
What we need to do is to move the recycling process forward into the repair world .
The Volkswagen Beetle was a terrible car ,
but it was eminently recyclable .
I had one for almost twenty years
and at the end there was n't a single part that was original .
The entire body had been swapped out , the machinery several times , and the running gear many times .
It was still running when I sold it ,
but if VDOT ever checked the serial numbers , I do n't know what would happen .
The other thing we need to do is expand the deposit idea .
In addition to having deposits on soft drink bottles , we should have them on appliances , autos and other big ticket items where they can do some good .
The deposit would flow to the recycler who is the final user :
this would make recycling profitable .
He would claim the refund from the manufacturer .
This would ensure that the user of a product pays for its disposal ,
and manufacturers would have an incentive to keep the deposit money as long as possible by building items that can be repaired rather than disposed of .
In the case of foreign manufacturers , the recycling fee would haqve a similar effect as an import duty and could be collected in the same way , but without being called a tariff .
Why do some localities charge for the service while others do n't ?
Just curious .
Because , for the most part , it is a money losing operation , or at most marginal .
Recall the story of mandatory newspaper recycling in the District .
As a political city , they created so much waste product they flooded the market .
If you want to look down the road , think about what is going to happen after we spend a few billion to meet the Chesapeake Bay waste water restrictions .
Where are we going to put all the sludge that results ?
Once we stop putting it in the Bay , we are going to have to put it on the land .
Then we will have regulations to prevent sludge runoff in order that we do n't pay for the same sludge creation multiple times .
Eventually we will outlaw gravity so that sludge is prohibited from running downhill .
Coming soon to a farm near you : two month 's worth of stench .
As an engineer and a flinty New Englander , and a farmer , I spend a lot of time fixing old junk .
I ca n't stand throwing something away .
Maybe some of it comes from growing up on an island where there was no place to throw it .
My father used to say that garbage was like scotch tape .
-LRB- Shaking his thumb with an imaginary loop of tape on it . -RRB-
`` You ca n't throw it away ,
you can only stick it someplace else . ''
When I 'm repairing something that was designed so it ca n't be fixed , it makes me crazy .
I want to go find some enginner and marketing guy an knock heads together .
Here are a few examples .
A rototiller with gears made out of free machining brass .
Guaranteed to fail .
A windshiel wiper motor installed in a totally inaccessible place under the dash .
It was installed by compressing four little rubber studs into holes in the sheet metal , and sealed with a ten inch oblong flat gasket .
When the rubber studs rotted away , the motor fell on the floor , followed by a torrent of rain that shorted out everything under the dash .
A 1/4 inch diameter spring loaded shift lever detent that you had to break the tractor in half to replace .
Every piece of household plumbing and wiring I ever had to fish through a hollow wall .
Anything that can only be repaired upside down .
A twelve bolt circle on a transmission housing with six hex head bolts and six star pattern bolts .
Try and figure that out in the dark under the car .
The ignitor for the gas range that costs 25 % of what the range cost .
What 's worse is , that because I 'm good at this , people think I like it .
Wrong .
I hate things
and I love flesh .
I 'm convinced that things are inhabited with Gremlins .
It 's a vicious circle .
The more stuff you have the more stuff you need to maintain it , like the Virginia Highways .
It starts with a screwdriver ,
and next thing you know it 's a shopfull of air compressors , saws , welders , a forklift , an earthmover , a dump truck to haul the earthmover .....
My wife takes great glee in making fun of all of this .
Then I pointed out all he special purpose tools in her kithchen ,
and that is just for one job .
She carefuly forgets all that when she needs something and it turns out that I have just the right framitz to manufacture a repair piece for her thing - a - bob .
I 'm convinced that we could solve our balance of payments deficits if we just passed must be repairable laws .
Every engineer should be required to be a mechanic for ten years .
For many of us our life has come down to buy it at Wal - mart and take it to the dump .
Even if you buy it at the BMW or John Deere dealer it is no different .
So , if PEC wants to make a supporter out of me , the way to do it is to start a campaign that ensures things do n't have to be thrown away , not one to recycle them at a loss .
I work for E-Tech Recycling Inc -LRB- http://www.etechrecycling.com -RRB- , an electronics recycling company located in Virginia .
We recycle all types of electronics items such as computers , monitors , TVs etc.
When I speak with people about the importance of recycling electronic items , they are very ignorant .
I think more than anything , we need to educate people about the importance of recycling .

Note : There 's a piece by George Packer in The New Yorker -LRB- '' Betrayed : the Iraqis who trusted America the most '' -RRB- about all this , but it 's way too long to blog here .
Check it out if you want .
It 's hair - raising stuff .
Christ , can no one trust an American anymore ?
I 'm gettting sick and tired of being ashamed of the USA .
What have we come to ?
Fuck , piss , shit .
Anyway , here 's a shorter piece from Mother Jones :
Thrown to the Assassins
They cheered the U.S. invasion ;
they offered to help , signed on as translators , risked everything they had to work for the United States .
But when they had to run for their lives , America slammed the door .
By David Case / Mother Jones
On the day the American tanks rolled into Baghdad , Abather Abdul Hussein and his wife , Balqes Abdel Mohammed , threw flowers .
Literally .
After a lifetime of turmoil and tyranny , the couple fervently believed the invasion would bring peace .
Abather joined U.S. `` democratization '' efforts , such as a project to create a governing council for his neighborhood , and he occasionally ended up in the good - news Iraq stories that still seemed plausible in those days ;
one U.S. paper ran a five - column photo of him perched on a classroom chair surrounded by American soldiers , with a story about the `` new Iraq . ''
These days , Abather and his young family are among the hundreds of thousands of Iraqis who have fled in fear for their lives .
After months spent dodging insurgents who had targeted them for supporting the Americans , he and Balqes are relieved to have escaped -- and bitter , like thousands of fellow refugees , that the superpower for which they risked their lives has abandoned them .
A short man who bundles his shattered body in layers against the desert 's winter chill , the 34 - year - old Abather is polite and relaxed , with an easy smile .
An engaging conversationalist even in broken English , he loves to talk about Baghdad , his infant daughter , and his wife , an outspoken woman several years his senior , whom he calls a genius .
`` When we met she was a professor at Baghdad University , '' he boasts .
`` I was her student .
When she walked into a room , hundreds of people would stand to pay her respect . ''
Considering that his life savings will run out in two months , that he ca n't work legally in Jordan , and that he could be deported at any moment , Abather is remarkably stoic , though the anxiety leaks out in tics .
He chain - smokes cheap Craven A cigarettes , crushing the charred filters in an overflowing ashtray ;
when Balqes complains , he sheepishly offers that `` smoking is my only work . ''
It 's not quite true --
his one other job during the past 18 months has been recounting his nightmare , over and over again , to border guards , embassy workers , and aid agencies .
In December , he reluctantly told it to me , pulling documents from a worn leather folder to corroborate the details .
The story began after the ouster of Saddam , when Abather and Balqes , like many Iraqis , launched a de-Baathification program of their own .
Their target was the dean who had been Balqes ' boss at Baghdad University -LRB- and who , as Abather tells it , had forced her out when she resisted joining the Baath Party -RRB- .
Balqes wanted her job back ;
one day Abather confronted the dean ,
and tempers flared .
American soldiers broke up the brawl , bound Abather 's wrists with a zip tie , and interrogated him .
He explained Balqes ' gripe and what the loss of her job had meant for their family , including their 3 - year - old son and Balqes ' 14 - year - old son from a previous marriage -LRB- her first husband had been killed in the Iran - Iraq War -RRB- .
Though he held a master 's degree in engineering , Abather had n't been able to get a job in the doldrums of sanctions - era Iraq ,
so he was scraping together a living repairing watches , his wife and children crammed into his father 's small home .
`` The soldiers were very understanding , '' Abather recalls .
`` I was impressed . ''
They offered the family an apartment in a place called Iraqi Village , a compound near the Baghdad airport where Saddam had housed orphans he was grooming to become fedayeen loyalists .
In return , the couple translated for the Americans , and eventually the Washington National Guard 's 1st Battalion 303rd Armored Regiment hired Balqes as an interpreter , at $ 15 per day .
Abather ended up leading a U.S. Army - contracted security squad with a monthly salary of $ 130 .
Learning that he was an engineer , soldiers later gave him lucrative reconstruction assignments .
He started an engineering firm and worked with contractors such as ABB and Kellogg , Brown and Root ;
in one heady year , Abather 's contracts would mushroom from a few thousand dollars to an $ 862,000 electrification project -LRB- later canceled because he could n't procure the needed equipment -RRB- .
Abather and Balqes glow with wonder when they speak of those days , of earning a good living and having their own home for the first time .
Most of all , Abather enjoyed hanging out with the Americans .
He seems to remember every soldier he ever met :
Captain Philips and Sergeant Buchard gave his children toys , a soccer ball , and school stationery ;
Lieutenant Glenn Allen got so close to the family they called him `` Uncle Allen . ''
-LRB- Allen confirmed Abather 's story in emails to me , calling him and Balqes `` very helpful individuals '' who `` risked their lives by meeting with us . '' -RRB-
It was as if they had suddenly found themselves citizens of the 51st state .
And so , in October 2004 , when Abather got his first death threat , he thought it was a joke .
It was handwritten , tucked under the windshield wiper of his car inside Iraqi Village , a gated community with American checkpoints at both its entrances ;
The note read :
Abather , Leave your work with the Americans .
Otherwise you will be killed by jihadis because you are a traitor .
Jihad Army
Then the killings began .
Lieutenant Allen had once given Abather a photo depicting two American soldiers with five of their Iraqi friends .
Three of the Iraqis were assassinated in short order .
Abather began to notice cars following him ,
and a few times shots were fired at his car .
The anonymous notes grew increasingly menacing .
Eventually , Iraqi Village felt so dangerous that Abather and Balqes moved the family back to his father 's house .
A death threat arrived there almost immediately .
Still Abather continued working with the Americans .
One day in August 2005 , Abather was driving Balqes , six months pregnant with their second child , to a doctor 's appointment .
At an intersection , he noticed a gold car parked by the road ;
suddenly the two men in it leveled guns at him .
`` This is the end , '' Abather thought ,
and then a U.S. patrol appeared
and the assailants vanished into traffic .
Within days , Abather and Balqes had sold off their belongings and fled to Amman .
Their troubles had only just begun .
The U.S. Embassy in Amman is an attractive , Arabian - style fortress , heavily guarded machine - gunners in Ford pickups .
It sits high on a hillside ,
and the view is so phenomenal that you can imagine your gaze reaching all the way to the Iraqi border , some 200 miles away .
In the foreground , Amman 's rolling mosaic of pale , boxy limestone buildings shimmers against the azure sky .
At its edges , in dank apartments on outlying hillsides , lives a substantial portion of Baghdad 's educated middle class .
Almost all fled in a panic , after getting death threats or seeing loved ones murdered ;
many were targeted by insurgents or jihadis because they supported , or worked for , the Americans .
Of Iraq 's 27 million prewar population , about 1 in 8 -- some 3.4 million people -- have left their homes since the invasion , according to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees -LRB- unhcr -RRB- ,
and more than half of those have ended up abroad .
Refugees International labels this the world 's fastest - growing humanitarian crisis .
Yet the Bush administration has refused to so much as acknowledge the refugees ' plight , let alone help them get to safety or even provide basic humanitarian aid .
In the past , notes Bill Frelick , refugee policy director at Human Rights Watch , the United States has often aided those persecuted for supporting it ;
since the Vietnam War , 1 million Vietnamese refugees have been resettled in the United States , including tens of thousands of South Vietnamese army veterans .
But the Bush administration `` has abdicated that obligation , '' says Frelick .
`` The people who have fled are the ones the administration was relying on to build democracy in Iraq ;
it would rather ignore them than acknowledge that its initiative has failed . ''
It was in Jordan that Abather and Balqes discovered the limitations of their friendship with the United States .
Lieutenant `` Uncle '' Allen had emailed the embassy in Amman to explain that the family feared for their lives ;
he 'd even offered to sponsor their relocation `` to the safety of the United States . ''
An unsigned email from the embassy commended Allen -- '' I know that your Iraqi friends appreciate your friendship '' -- but noted that U.S. visas are `` quite difficult '' for Iraqis to get .
Since 9 / 11 , Middle Easterners in general , and Iraqis in particular , have faced enormous hurdles getting admitted to the United States ;
until 2005 , the Bush administration maintained a total freeze on Iraqis that shut out current refugees as well as hundreds of people who had fled Saddam Hussein 's regime years earlier .
The email nonetheless provided instructions on getting a tourist visa ,
and Abather and Balqes quickly filed their application along with the $ 200 fee -- almost two months ' rent .
Several months later they were notified that they could visit the United States for up to three months , but that they could not bring their children .
They then made repeated visits to the unhcr to apply for official refugee status .
As it has with almost 99 percent of the Iraqis who have come through its office in Amman , the agency turned them down .
Abather and Balqes set their sights on a visa to Australia , a major destination for Iraqi refugees , and even hired an Iraqi lawyer there .
They waited for months .
Their savings dwindled ;
then their baby fell ill ,
and the emergency surgery , for an intestinal obstruction , cost $ 2,100 in cash .
In early June 2006 , Abather got a rejection letter from Australia .
Around the same time , word came that his father had died of a heart attack .
So he went back to Iraq to bury his father , help his mother find a place to live , and buy state - subsidized medicine for his daughter .
But when he returned to the Jordanian border less than a week later , he was told he could n't reenter the country :
Having recently suffered two terrorist attacks , Jordan had enacted a ban on entry for Iraqi men aged 17 to 35 .
For two days Abather stood on the highway at the border post , beseeching successive shifts of immigration officials .
Finally , a guard promised to send the medicine to his family in Amman if he would just go away .
Once again Abather headed back to Baghdad .
Driving in Baghdad a few days later , he noticed a bmw -- the Iraqi gangster 's vehicle of choice -- in his rearview mirror , closing in .
The car forced him off the road ;
armed men blindfolded him and knocked him unconscious .
When he woke up , he was in a tiny room , handcuffed to a chair .
Masked men came and went , videotaping as they cursed him as a traitor .
They whipped him with a steel cable ;
six months later , his back was still etched by deep , evenly spaced grooves .
`` We 've been searching for you for a year , '' his captors told him .
Abather recognized the voice of one man , an acquaintance from Iraqi Village who had seemed to befriend the Americans .
`` I 'm sorry your father passed away , '' the man said .
Soon , a bearded imam sentenced Abather to decapitation for collaborating with the United States .
Abather barely heard the proceedings .
`` I was thinking the whole time about my little daughter in Amman . ''
He was told he could save himself by spying on the Americans , but he refused .
On the eighth day , the men asked if there was anything he wanted before he died ;
then they put him on the floor in the back of the bmw and sped off .
Suddenly , Abather heard gunshots .
The men shouted .
The car crashed ,
and everything went black .
He woke up in a hospital bed 60 miles from Baghdad ;
Iraqi forces had attacked the bmw and pulled him from the burning wreck .
He had a compound fracture in his leg and severe burns all over his body ,
but the nurses urged him to leave :
His captors would be looking for him .
His brother -- who had received a ransom note from the kidnappers , complete with a photo of Abather bound and gagged -- brought him back to Baghdad , where doctors fused a piece of plastic onto his shin and grafted skin from his thighs over his wounds .
A few weeks later , he was back at the Jordanian border ,
and this time the guards took pity .
The family had n't told Balqes of the kidnapping .
But when she saw her disfigured husband , she says , `` I knew right away what happened . ''
On a crisp , clear day this past December , clutching a sheaf of papers documenting Abather and Balqes ' ordeal -- contracts , soldiers ' recommendations , death threats , a missing - person report -- I headed to American Citizen Services at the U.S. Embassy in Amman .
Abather and Balqes had made several pilgrimages there ;
they were convinced that if only they could speak to an American , Abather 's charred and mangled flesh would make their case , but they had never gotten past the Jordanian security guards .
Outside the embassy , I joined a chatty , eclectic crowd of Americans : a retired hippie turned English teacher from Vermont ; a woman with a New York accent who struggled through the narrow eye - slit in her black veil to keep track of her hyperactive daughter ; a white - bearded man in a Santa hat , who said he was picking up his passport before returning to the North Pole .
I wondered whether any of us would risk our lives for the United States as Abather and Balqes had .
To get past the compound 's first wall , we navigated a metal detector , a body frisk , and an X-ray machine ;
after crossing a 30 - foot no man 's land we repeated the process at the second wall .
Then we waited to be called .
The United States admits more refugees than any country in the world ,
but in 2006 , only 202 Iraqis were allowed in ,
and most of them had fled persecution under Saddam before the war .
This year , millions of Iraqis , Tibetans , Sri Lankans , and Afghans must compete for a mere 5,500 refugee slots Congress has allocated for the Middle East and South Asia .
The Iraqis are in line behind their compatriots who have been waiting in Jordan since the late 1990s .
Like other Western representatives , U.S. officials here refer displaced people to the unhcr , which is charged with determining whether someone is a real refugee , and if so , with finding him a safe place to go .
Except that , as Amman unhcr head Robert Breen told me , a 1998 agreement with Jordan forbids the agency from classifying anyone as a refugee whom it ca n't get out of the country within six months -- an impossibility in the post / 11 world .
-LRB- A country of about 6 million , Jordan has long had the world 's highest refugee population per capita , hosting more than a million Palestinians who fled Israel in 1948 and were supposed to stay only a short time . -RRB-
Of the 21,000 Iraqi asylum seekers the office has registered since the U.S. invasion , only 291 have been granted refugee status ; meanwhile the line outside the unhcr 's gates gets longer every week ,
and the wait for an interview stands at five months .
To care for all of the region 's displaced Iraqis , the agency had a total budget of $ 22 million in 2006 -- less than $ 7 a person , which must cover not only the Kafkaesque registration programs but also basic survival aid to refugees trapped in desert camps or squatting in abandoned buildings .
Recognizing the potential for `` severe humanitarian suffering , '' the Iraq Study Group in December recommended that `` the United States take the lead '' in funding the UNHCR 's Iraq program ;
currently it donates no more than a quarter of the budget .
Direct U.S. aid to the refugees consists of a tiny grant to the Catholic relief organization Caritas -LRB- see `` How to Help , '' page 68 -RRB- .
At the embassy , I recounted Abather and Balqes ' ordeal at Window 3 , then at Window 1 -- the setup was similar to visitation in a high - security prison .
Then , at Window 4 , I told the story again to the consul general , who stood behind the bulletproof glass wearing a telephone headset .
I was expecting to hear that `` the United States is doing its best to help , ''
but there was only silence as the consul 's eyes welled up .
-LRB- An Amman - based aid worker later told me that American diplomats are so distraught by the policies they are charged with representing that `` it just takes a few gin and tonics and they 'll break down . '' -RRB-
Finally , the consul said , `` We hear stories like this all the time .
We have enormous empathy for the Iraqis who 've suffered after working with the Americans ,
but there 's really nothing the embassy can do for them . ''
She handed me a document outlining Congress ' sole concession to people like Abather and Balqes : visas for up to 50 military translators from Iraq or Afghanistan each year .
`` But do n't get their hopes up , '' she added quickly ;
there were thousands with the same story .
`` This is something Congress really needs to address , '' she said as we parted .
The administration certainly does n't seem inclined to take the initiative .
Philip A. Frayne , an embassy spokesman in Amman , told me that `` there are no reliable figures '' on how many people have fled Iraq , and that in any case , it was Saddam who drove out `` a large percentage '' of them .
Likewise , in its 2006 annual refugee report to Congress , the State Department focused mainly on those Saddam - era exiles , and blithely intoned , `` It is hoped that significant numbers of Iraqi refugees will soon be able to return home , although the security situation will remain an important consideration . ''
The report ignored the fact that , according to a survey by the nonprofit U.S. Committee for Refugees , 644,500 new refugees entered Jordan and Syria in 2005 alone .
And 2006 will likely be worse .
As much as a quarter of greater Amman 's population is now Iraqi ,
and the crowds have exacerbated the city 's severe water shortage .
Prices have skyrocketed .
Until recently Iraqi children could n't attend Jordanian schools ,
and their parents can not legally work ;
easily identified by their dialect , Iraqis are discriminated against and terrified of deportation .
Some refugees never go outside .
Jordanian government spokesman Nasser S. Judeh told me that his country , a staunch U.S. ally and aid recipient , `` certainly needs help , and has held discussions with U.S. diplomats '' about this issue .
Incidentally , Human Rights Watch has also called upon the Gulf Arab states to pitch in ;
Saudi Arabia 's response so far has been to plan construction of a 560 - mile wall along its border with Iraq .
Before I left Jordan , Abather invited me to visit his family and a physician friend from Baghdad who shares their two - room basement apartment .
On the Al Zawraa TV channel from Baghdad , we watched U.S. Army vehicles disappear behind roadside bomb blasts as a man sang , `` Let 's go kill the Americans ! ''
The channel 's endless stream of anti-American propaganda perplexed Abather and his friends :
`` Why does the United States allow this ? '' they inquired .
When images of dead children supposedly killed by the Americans hit the screen , Abather 's friend switched to a channel on which voluptuous Arab women danced in an un-Islamic way .
Balqes served Iraqi coffee ,
and to keep the baby from playing with the colorful cups , Abather suspended her from an elastic swing above our heads .
She giggled as he bounced her by her tiny foot .
This is her prison , he joked .
Six months after the kidnapping , he still had n't gotten the surgery he needed to heal his burned flesh ;
if the wounds become infected , he could die .
Abather rarely complained .
God is testing us , he said .
But we will get through it .
He looked at the girl bouncing from the ceiling and smiled .
I have a daughter ,
and I 'm very happy .
Balqes was more fearful -- twice in the past month , suspicious men had shown up at the apartment .
Iraq , she worried , had already caught up with them .
How to Help
Very few organizations are working on getting aid to Iraqi refugees , and of those that are , many are too small or too beleaguered to accept individual donations ;
the Iraqi Red Crescent , for example , has suffered bombings and mass kidnappings , yet its volunteers continue to deliver aid to displaced families inside Iraq .
One of the larger relief organizations working with the refugees is the Catholic group Caritas , whose caseworkers I shadowed while in Amman .
Bucking the image of the Land Rover - driving aid worker , they made their rounds in an aging gray Honda , its roof eaten through by rust .
They visited Iraqi doctors , engineers , and executives desperate for food , heat , or blankets to fend off the desert winter ;
one family told the crew they had just sold their stove to buy food .
Caritas helps a few thousand families a year ,
but the demand far outstrips the money available to us , says Magy Mahrous , who oversees the project .

To ensure that the money reaches the Iraqi program , write Iraq - icmc on your check .
The Wall Street Journal editorial page this morning has praised `` a gang of conservative GOP members in the general assembly '' for foiling Gov. Timothy M. Kaine 's taxes - for - transportation plan .
`` This was a victory against long odds , because the renegade house members were lined up against the Governor , powerful Republicans in the state senate , elements of the business community and the state 's largely pro-tax media . ''
The Journal cited the state 's revenue surplus as a major reason why voters never warmed to the tax - hike idea , and noted that it did n't help that Kaine was trying to raise gasoline taxes amidst soaring retail prices at the pump .
I wonder how the Journal would interpret news from the Washington Post today that Del. David B. Albo , R - Springfield and a number of other GOP delegates would like to raise an estimated $ 400 million a year from Northern Virginia to spend on local road and rail projects .
`` Roads cost money , '' the Post quotes Albo as saying .
`` I 'd love to find a way to pay for the things we need by not raising taxes and using existing revenue ,
but I 'm a realist . ''
While most GOP delegates were willing to hang together to oppose a statewide tax increase , there seems to be little appreciation of the root causes of transportation dysfunction in Virginia .
Oh , sure , you 've got yer Bill Howell talking about tolls and privatization ,
and you 've got yer Tim Hugo backing telework ,
and the House did pass some marginally useful legislation dealing with VDOT and land use ,
but deep down inside , in their heart of hearts , most delegates share the assumption of their counterparts in the state Senate that the cause of traffic congestion is insufficient transportation capacity .
The disagreement is over how much money the state can afford to raise to pay for improvements .
Personally , I think it 's a bit too early for anyone to proclaim a `` victory . ''
Yes , the House has temporarily beat back proposals for some $ 1 billion in tax increases .
But simply starving the current , broken transportation system of funds is n't going to solve anything .
The House , along with everyone else , needs to get on with the business of re-thinking transportation fundamentals .
Otherwise , they 'll end up like Dave Albo , promoting tax increases through the back door .
The business of re-thinking transportation fundamentals then testing , validating , and implementing the results of all that thinking is going to take longer and cost more than what they have saved by starving the current system of funds .
It is going to take much more than a billion dollars in tax increases to achieve any alternative plan , and then the alternative may turn out to be like the inter-county connector :
that is , the same old plan only 50 years later .
In the meantime , we still suffer under the costs of the congestion tax , for which we get nothing in return ,
and the costs of any action , whether alternative or traditional continues to go up .
In the end we are going to be coming around to the back door like beggars ,
but the alms will be around $ 4 billion instead of one .
Yeah , I 'd say it was too early to claim victory .
Jim : Thank you for recognizing the problem .
`` But simply starving the current , broken transportation system of funds is n't going to solve anything .
The House , along with everyone else , needs to get on with the business of re-thinking transportation fundamentals . ''
Your `` but deep down inside , in their heart of hearts , most delegates share the assumption of their counterparts in the state Senate that the cause of traffic congestion is insufficient transportation capacity . '' is challenged by the Post report on the view of the leaders in the Senate
They say the state 's less populated regions are also in desperate need of better roads to draw jobs and reverse economic decline .
Until our leaders recognize that the role of transportation is limited to being economic enabler , and not an economic driver we will be locked in to the current funding stalemate .
Spending taxpayer dollars on transportation to `` draw jobs and reverse economic decline '' is like pushing on a rope .
Reducing the costs of the congestion tax is the only way to advance the Virginia 's economy .
And yet 90 % of the state 's roads are uncongested 90 % of the time
and 45 % of all travel happens on and during the other 10 % .
How hard is this to figure out , really ?
Traffic congestion is less during recessions , and some cities would willingly trade high unemployment rates for congestion .
Traffic congestion becomes self - correcting when businesses choose to leave an area because it is too crowded and plagued by delays .
Politicians want the growth that brings congestion , yet they also want to control or reduce that congestion .
They refuse to implement effective strategies to relieve congestion because the stringent solutions required might , like congestion itself , redirect growth to other areas .
This is not a new problem .
Rome restricted deliveries to night time because the carts made the streets dangerous , but night deliveries interrupted sleep .
London had parking restrictions in the 1600's .
Affordable public transportation was developed to ease the overcrowding and polllution that prevailed before .
Zoning was developed in New York to encourage people to move out of the city center , subsidized by flat fares on the trolleys .
Later , trolley tracks became jammed with trolleys and the system became overcrowded .
When roads began to take over from railroads , the problem soon became obvious :
`` None of us should delude ourselves , however , that the road problem of Virginia ... will be solved at least for many years .
Those who use the roads will demand wider , smoother and safer roads due to their increasing use and the consequent congestion on the highways . '' -
Governor Harry Byrd , 1930 State of the Commonwealth
Whether you call Smart Growth , Transit oriented design , New Urbanism , pedestrian Oriented Communities or what have you , the end result of higher densities will be more congestion in more localized places .
We might be able to alleviate some of that by creating a transit system that is 20 times as dense as we have ,
but I doubt we have the economic stomach for that , either , particularly since that style of living is likely to attract only 15 % of the population .
Planners and environmentalists are disingenuous when they urge us to fight congestion through smart growth .
Politicians at heart , they really want more congested environments -LRB- for everyone else -RRB- but presumably want that congestion to be somehow managed and accommodated .
If it is not accommodated , people will start to move to the suburbs specifically to avoid congestion .
As George will put it , `` The purpose of ' smart ' ' coordinated ' growth is to prevent the masses , in their freedom , from producing democracy 's byproducts -- untidiness and even vulgarity .
And the bland notion of ' planning ' often is the rubric under which government operates when making its preferences and prophecies -- often meaning its arrogance and its mistakes -- mandatory . ''
So , it 's not all that hard to push a rope - you just need to freeze it first .
but anyone that thinks any of this is going to be solved , by whatever means , without lots and lots of money needs to go Back to square one .
Jim , I ask , what is victory ?
For the Dems , either no transportation deal or a comprehensive one is victory , the former because it imporves the electoral landscape in '07 .
For the GOP , something akin to what they were proposing may seem to be a victory to them , but more likely a victory for the Dems because voters wo n't see any benefit by '07 .
But Jim , is it a victory solely if taxes are n't raised ?
Bob , No , I would n't define victory as simply not raising taxes -- although I definitely would like to defer raising taxes as long as prudently possible .
To me , victory would be winning the acknowledgement of a critical mass of the General Assembly that the solution to traffic congestion is not just raising taxes / adding capacity .
A rational approach to transportation would entail -LRB- 1 -RRB- creating communities with a mix of housing / office / retail / amenities to reduce the number and length of automobile trips , -LRB- 2 -RRB- reforming counterproductive zoning codes , subdivision ordinances and comprehensive plans in order to create more transit - friendly and pedestrian - friendly communities , -LRB- 3 -RRB- creating funding sources for transportation that establishes a rational nexus between those who use / benefit from transportation facilities and those who pay for them , -LRB- 4 -RRB- promoting telework , -LRB- 5 -RRB- liberating mass transit from government monopolies and encouraging private sector innovation , -LRB- 6 -RRB- using a wide range of tools , from corridor management to intelligent transportation systems , to increase the capacity of existing thoroughfares , -LRB- 7 -RRB- stretching the value of road construction / maintenance dollars through outsourcing , and -LRB- 8 -RRB- prioritizing transportation projects on a congestion - mitigation Return on Investment basis .
Virginia has started tinkering with a number of these , but has not systematically explored any of them .
Until the General Assembly gets serious about fundamental change , we can not declare victory -- no matter how high / low taxes and raised / cut .
Bob - with all due respect , you 're blowing smoke .
Most people in NoVA want an adequate public facilities ordinance and do n't believe that anything related to transportation is anything more than another way to foster more development .
THey believed that in 2002 and still do today .
People voted for Tim Kaine because many of us truly believed his statement that `` enough was enough . ''
Many of us saw his very modest proposal to postpone development where the roads could not handle today 's traffic as a small step towards APF .
-LRB- Kaine made his `` promise '' with full knowledge of the power of the builders in Virginia . -RRB-
Yet , once confronted with the expected opposition , Kaine did a 180 and joined the other side --
`` pay more , so we can develop more . ''
There are quite a few good Democrats , Independents and Republicans who now believe that Tim Kaine has joined the dark side .
No one believes that anything before the General Assembly will fix the transportation mess we have .
No one trusts any Virginia elected official on land use issues , especially given Kaine 's switch and Gerry Connolly 's wholesale giveaways to the developers .
-LRB- How about $ 43 million plus in Fairfax County taxpayer subsidies to land development and zoning services since `` Condo Connolly '' took over the BoS chair ? -RRB-
This is not to argue that the GOP is sitting any better .
People in NoVA want an end to policies that support growth without regard to the impacts on current residents .
If I wanted to run for office in 07 , I 'd go door - to - door and say `` I 'm running because Tim Kaine lied to us about development
and I 'll fight for an adequate public facilities ordinance as my number one priority .
I 'll oppose any transfer of more money from NoVA taxpayers until we get APF . ''
I 'll bet you I 'd get more votes from Democrats , Independents and Republicans than a candidate who says we need to continue the status quo , but with more funding for VDOT .
-LRB- 1 -RRB- and -LRB- 2 -RRB- are part and parcel of the same thing .
It might reduce the number and length of some car trips ,
but it will result in more localized congestion , and maybe even more congestion overall .
Reducing the number of trips is NOT ordinarily a rational approach to transportation , although it could be in some limited cases .
-LRB- 3 -RRB- I have no problem with , except that even non-users benefit from roads , so it ca n't be totally user driven .
-LRB- 4 -RRB- I agree with and support , however we may have already sucked much of the juice out of that orange
and it conflicts with -LRB- 1 -RRB- .
If you accomplish -LRB- 5 -RRB- You will effectively eliminate much of mass transit , unless you have privately operated but subsidized mass transit .
This is a recipe for pork , payola , and patronage .
-LRB- 6 -RRB- Increasing the capacity of existing thoroughfares is a waste since 90 % of our roads are underused 90 % of the time .
It is also an admission that -LRB- 1 -RRB- is insufficient .
-LRB- 7 -RRB- and -LRB- 8 -RRB- I have no problem with .
But I really have a problem with -LRB- 2 -RRB- .
It is OK so far as it goes ,
but the likely market for the market created by such zoning might only be 15 % of the population .
What it leaves out is what happens to everybody else , who happens not to be in an area designated for transit friendly development .
Are you also willing to also reform counterproductive zoning codes that requires people to stay in the business of farming , for example ?
If more density is good for some areas , why not all ?
I know your answer will be that those people should be allowed to live where they please as long as they pay their full locational costs .
But we can already see that those costs are subject to maipulation :
people whose costs include supporting the Dulles Toll road are also supporting the transit that will make it possible for future residents to live in transit friendly neighborhoods .
Whatever happened to THEM paying their full locational costs ?
Transit is going to require massive and widespread subsidies to even partially work .
Here , again , some allowance needs to be made for the idea that transit provides some limited benefit to non-users .
So , those people who are left out will be expected to pay for the transit that helps make those included in development areas possible .
At the same time they will likely be excluded from increasing density even when it is to their benefit -LRB- they may live next to those 90 % of roads that are underutilized -RRB- .
This will be done partially in order to artificially create the demand required to fill the designated areas , and the cover story will be that it is for the environment , to save prime farmland , etc.
This amounts to disingenuously making certain preferences and prophesies mandatory ,
and I do n't think it will fly .
When Virginia does systematically explore these ideas they may very well come to the conclusion that Fundamental Change is a really lousy idea , and that , bad as it is , business as usual is the best option after all .
The main reson they are likely to reach that conclusion is that the costs for all this theoretical thinking and experimental development is going to be far higher than the money we `` saved '' on transportation by not providing it .
I see what TMT says as the other side of the same coin I described above .
If we get APF's they will be disproportionately used against those who are `` left out '' of development plans , and consequently used to ram still more development down TMT 's throat .
After all , they will say , that is where the most facilities are ;
even if they are inadequate , they are more adequate than places that have none .
Will Rogers once joked that if you wanted to cure traffic congestion , just make people pay cash for their cars up front .
The APF idea is the same kind of joke .
None of the development we have was built when the facilities were adequate , and much of it was built specifically to get away from places that had inadequate facilities and were over built .
We are not going to pay for APF's up front , so it is a recipe for creating either no development or only hoplessly expensive development
-LRB- See Morgan 's Riflemen -RRB- .
APF's are a good idea only if you are willing to provide a dedicated and adequate funding stream for them , same as for Metro .
And that means you need a lot more money .
And it is no good to claim that it has to be done without impacting current residents .
It is still going to come out of your pocket in the end .
Just as roads benefit those who do n't drive and transit benefits those that do n't ride , development benefits those that do n't build .
This last creates a real problem and hardship because existing residents have no way to capitalize on their fortune unless they move .
But if the APF's are disproportionately applied , then there wo n't be any place to move to .
In that case the benefits and disbenefits of APF's cancel each other out ,
and there is no reason to implement what is a lousy idea to begin with .
I do n't have online access to the WSJ , but did it really refer to the `` general assembling '' and did it also fault Kaine for `` trying to raise gasoline taxes ? ''
If so , does the WSJ have a fact checker on staff ?
Once we 're done with this doomed debate , we can move on to contemplate the doubled energy prices we can all expect when we get to enjoy the full benefits of a deregulated electricity market in a couple years .
Hmmm --
double the cost of juice and hopelessly clogged roads .
Will the last ones out `` free market '' Virginia please turn out the lights on your way to North Carolina ?
Not Grover , Thanks for catching my typo .
I have corrected it .
And that 's a good point about Kaine 's `` gasoline tax . ''
There has been so much back and forth that I ca n't remember every permutation of every tax plan .
But was not the point of both the Kaine and the Senate tax plans to NOT tax gasoline at the pump -- indeed to tax anything but gasoline at the pump ?
In that case , the WSJ got its information very wrong .
Yesterday as I was cruising along at below traffic speed but still 65 in 55 a tow truck passed me like I was sitting still .
He was running at least 75 and maybe more .
He was towing a school bus .
That kind of behavior makes you think there might be some value in Albo 's plan to increase fines for really bad drivers , especially since almost a third of traffic cogestion is caused by incidents .
I have long held that fines for professional drivers should be tripled -
these guys should know better .
Jim , I agree with most of your proposals , or at least the goals you hope to achieve with them .
But I am suspicious of the outsourcing and private partnerships .
I 'd rather reform public entities because private entities require a level of cost public ones should n't -- profit .
I agree with Ray that even non-users of transportation facilities benefit from them , but I do favor higher gas taxes and other directly related user fees .
And with congestion the way it is , building roads to nowhere in the hopes of fostering economic development may not be feasible .
Ray , I 'm surprised you think we ca n't do more teleworking .
Seems we have many opportunities to expand it .
But overall , demanding such reforms before expanding capacity simply wo n't work in the real world .
First , we 'll need to reform American capitalism itself , eliminating the public supported breaks we give to business , whether they be home developers , road builders , or farmers , as well as homeowners , i.e. , interest rate deductions .
Bottom line is we need more capacity and land use reform .
My interest is the politics of it .
Which brings me back to the same question , asked in that context :
How do you judge when the reforms you want are sufficient to invest more in increasing capacity ?
Jim , you may have a clear vision in your head about what that threshold is ,
but I sense from the SmartGrowth folks and anti-taxers who make many of the same arguements you do that any amount of reform will never be enough .
I think EMR convinced me that those that really can telework already do so .
There are a lot of people for whom it does not apply , retail , mechanics , etc.
There is more we can do on telework ,
but Ed suggests the well is not as deep as we would like to believe .
Then again , it runs counter or provides impetus that is counter to his other ideas .
I was formerly more optimistic ,
but in this case I found his argument persuasive .
I 'm open to more hard data , and I believe the biggest hindrance is organizational , not technical .
I favor higher gas taxes and user fees , too , but not exclusively because we all have a stake in roads .
I would make the same argument for transit :
it is OK for the general public or auto drivers -LRB- which is much the same thing -RRB- to provide some support for transit because there is some -LRB- small -RRB- benefit to everyone for those that are able and willing to use Metro etc.
On the other hand , once we understand how small that benefit really is we might decide it 's just not worth it ,
and we should let the thing be privatized where it works and disappear where it does n't .
I 'm with you .
We can not take hard lines on every issue and make progress in any direction .
Unfortunately , for some , strategic stalemate is just as good as any other means of conservation , never mind whatever other harm it does .

Braawwk !
Braawwkkk !
It did n't take long .
Route 288 , the circumferential highway running around the south - western quadrant of the Richmond New Urban Region , opened in late 2004 .
Already it is changing development patterns for the worse and causing localized traffic congestion around its exits .
The Richmond Times - Dispatch tells the tale today about the impact on the Huguenot Trail in Powhatan County .
Traffic has more than doubled in one section of Huguenot Trail since 288 opened , reports Will Jones .
Speeding and accidents have surged as well :
17 accidents have been reported near the intersection of Winterfield Road so far this year , up from 12 for all of 2004 .
Dale Totten , resident engineer for the Virginia Department of Transportation , noted that VDOT would four - lane the road for about $ 13 million if it had more money .
Of course , VDOT has no more money for road construction in the Richmond region .
One reason is that VDOT , at the behest of local politicians and boosters , spent all its friggin' money on 288 !
Where 's Homer Simpson when you need him ?
This is a major `` D'oh! '' moment .
As we predicted , Route 288 is generating residential development in scarcely populated areas all around its exits , overtaxing the local country roads .
While the limited access highway might provide limited traffic relief for people driving back and forth between Chesterfield and Goochland counties , other people are making choices about where they live and work ,
and they are creating traffic congestion in new places .
The only thing that surprises me is how rapidly this is happening .
Even I thought there might be a lag of three or four years .
If Route 288 has already created a $ 13 million road - construction in just this one exist , think of the liability it has created for all of its exits !
Here 's another prodiction :
After a few more years of scattered subdivision development and approval of mega-commercial projects at major 288 intersections , the need for new road improvements will soar .
Before the end of the decade , we may well see the unfunded liability zoom well past the original $ 400 million it took to build the original highway .
To the brainiacs who thought Route 288 was such a great idea :
Thanks for nothing .
I think we could have spent the $ 400 million better elsewhere .
I do n't think you can blame 288 for creating those people .
If there enough of them to create new traffic congestion in new places , then what is the alternative ?
Additional traffic congestion in old places ?
Now you understand how people like TMT in Fairfax feel .
I 'd usually take the pro-road position -
but with the glaring needs in other parts of the state , 288 was definitely excess ...
You have a city , Richmond , that has virtually no traffic .
The rush hour is 30 minutes long ...
And you give them a beltway through a largely rural area .
A road to no where ...
Just think if this money had been spent on another potomac crossing or road improvements that are desperately needed in NOVA ?
Virginia Centrist , To add insult to injury , the rest of the state helped pay for 288 in last year 's budget deal -- wiped the slate clean of debt .
It was very nice of y'all to oblige us .
Did n't make much sense , though .
It 's the same old problem .
If you get out ahead of the need you are accused of causing sprawl .
If you build where the need is already acute , then the claim is you ca n't pave your way out of congestion .
Anonymous -
That 's a fair point .
5:26 makes a good point .
However , this situation hammers home the validity of the state auditor 's report finding that the CTB and VDOT fail to fund transportation projects based on a comprehensive state transportation plan , but rather , based on whoever does the best job of lobbying .
I submit that this is a disgraceful situation that should not be tolerated .
Moreover , Senator Chichester and his toadies would make this worse by pouring more money into this flawed institution .
What is the purpose of transportation - related expenditures ?
In Virginia , it 's to benefit private business plans and not to serve the public interest .
You all are dead wrong .
No less than Walter Stoch stated that 288 money was intended to be paid from economic development money .
Come on folks !!
TMT : I do n't understand your point .
when was the last time you were stuck in traffic that you were n't on your way to or from some sort of business ?
It seems to me that the whole point of roads is to facilitate the public interest in getting to and from private businesses .
Then , of course there is the sunday drive , the trip to grandma 's , and the soccer games , but still , the overwhelming need is to support business .
Since our road expenditures nowhere near match the increase in business or state domestic product , it is no wonder we suffer congestion problems .
If we recognize that roads primaarily benefit businesses then we should do two things :
let business pay for more of our transportation bill , -LRB- which they will pass to us , of course -RRB- and incentivize them to locate where they put the least stress on the system , even if that means more overall travel .
Why is it so hard to understand ?
The solution is functional human settlement patterns and a balance between transport system capacity and land use generated travel deman .
All else is spin .
EMR
TMT said `` In Virginia , it 's to benefit private business plans and not to serve the public interest . ''
I do n't see the point of this statement because it appears to demonize private business plans and put the public interest above all else .
I think they are so tightly intertwined that they are virtually one and the same .
Obviously there are local problems because this cookie dough is lumpy ,
but in the aggregate if we demonize business long enough we will eventually find out we all work for the Devil .
I do n't see there is any point in claiming as `` a solution '' a balance that is dynamic and ever changing in nature .
Even you see rail to Dulles as a positive because Dulles is a job center that promotes bi-directional demand on the rail .
I agree .
In fact that may be sufficient reason to build it , all by itself .
All I 'm saying is that the exact same logic should apply to roads :
they should have destinations at both ends in order that we get maximum use out of our investment :
we need more places in order to get closer to the balance you say we need .
Reality check here -
I drive past Watkins Landing every morning and evening .
I commute back and forth to work on the Huguenot Trail .
I 've never seen anything remotely resembling a `` flood '' of traffic .
It 's a 55 mph zone - 75 to 100 cars in `` a morning '' - over how much time ?
The Huguenot Trail road widening was already planned , due to the heavy demands of development on the Chesterfield side , the new schools , and a whole bunch of existing developments that were zoned years ago and at that time funneled through Robious Road .
288 , for those of us that actually use it , is wonderful - instead of Powhatan and Western Chesterfield being bottlenecked by lack of roads ,
we can actually get some commercial development and have the ability to work closer to where we live .
You may think that 's not rational land use .
I have no desire to live in any city ,
I will not work in a downtown area ,
I will not use mass transit , which is not safe for female commuters that work long and irregular hours ,
and I happen to LIKE large lot development .
How exactly I 'm supposed to keep horses on a 1/4 acre lot is beyond me .
Gas could go to $ 10 a gallon
and I 'd still pay to live in the country .
Many people have legitimate preferences - horses , hunting , gardening , certain types of small business - that makes them NOT want to live in an urban core .
This infatuation with city living truly baffles me .
Anonymous 6:37 , You have every right to live in the country if that 's where you wish to live .
But you do n't have a right to have the rest of the state to underwrite construction of a $ 400 million highway to make it easier to shop and get to work .
What 's consistently overlooked in the debate ovre 288 is what else that $ 400 million could have been spent on .
How much traffic congestion could have been alleviated had the money been applied to other pressing road projects or , god forbid , even non-road projects .
Ray Hyde - My comments were directed at investors who lobby to place roads near where they own property and the incompetent system that funds these requests without regard to their link or lack thereof to a master transportation plan .
Check the following . http://www.nosprawltax.org/media/releases/2002Robbery.html and the associated map .
I think that it would be difficult to demonstrate that funding the desired projects illustrated on the map would be the best use of transportation revenues .
Even those of us who are isolated from the NoVA local economy understand the need to have transportation facilities so people can go to and from work .
But that would seem to argue for improving congestion hot spots and not enabling more development .
Note that I discuss transportation facilities and not roads .
We need to judge rail by the same engineering and economic standards as pavement .
OK that is a little different from the way I first read it .
But I still think lobbying is OK , both for the developers and for NoSprawlTax.org .
If it is wrong to look out for our own interests , then we should ALL shut up and let our officials do the job they were hired to do .
If there is blame to be placed for bad expenditures , let it fall on the officials .
NoSprawlTax.org and Jim Bacon are looking out for what they perceive to be their own financial interests , just as the developers are , so arguements based on inflammatory statements about others -LRB- `` speculators '' `` short term profits '' `` windfalls '' , and that sort of thing -RRB- fall on deaf ears to me .
Claiming that those financial interests are for the betterment of all does n't improve the argument in the least :
it is the same argument diluted .
With respect to the website you posted , I 'm not impressed .
The site shows a map of land plots that have been assembled by `` developers '' .
It purportedly shows how they would benefit by new roads , most of which already exist , as far as I can tell .
But ask yourself ,
how were those parcels assembled ?
They were purchased from landowners and citizens who were ready and willing to sell at the offered price .
If the smart growth coalition wants to keep `` cars few and open fields aplenty '' they can raise the money and put themselves in the same position the former and present landowners are in .
We have a perfectly legal system for doing just that , and by the way , it is heavily subsidized .
NoSrawlTax urges taxpayers to reject these new roads .
In doing so they are making enemies out of people like Anonymous 6:37 , and several others who have posted here .
In doing so they are also proposing that the costs of keeping those open fields aplenty be absorbed by someone else .
In other words , they want their wishes subsidized by someone else .
That someone else is a taxpayer , and maybe a developer .
They are in exactly the same boat as everyone else :
their assessments and their taxes are going up .
Why are they going up ?
because all of the rest of us are not paying our share ,
and because of demand that is not in anyone 's control .
Now , the assessments are based on what the land can be sold for on an unbiased exchange .
How can we assess property on that value and then prohibit the sale ?
What NoSprawlTax.org is suggesting is that we bias the exchange .
If we do that , then we destroy the basis for making the assessment .
Say the land was taxed only as its value for growing crops .
That value is actually negative , in this area .
At best , if NoSprawlTax had their way the tax collected on those properties would fall and everyone else 's would go up .
But to be fair , if we are going to eliminate all opportunity for those people other than the negative opportunity of growing crops -LRB- supposedly for our own tax benefit -RRB- then they need to be compensated ,
and our taxes will go up even more .
Conservation is expensive ,
and what NoSprawlTax.org wants is no different from what they claim the developers want :
something at someone else 's expense .
There are hundreds of parcels indicated on the map ,
and they will one day be owned by thousands of taxpayers .
When built , the roads will be there for all to use , so how can we claim that the roads are being subsidized by taxpayers for the benefit of business interests ?
They are going to take their profits and move on ,
but the taxpayers will still be there , and still be paying or the roads they need .
You and I may or may not use the roads to go visit for a weekend poker game , or make a service call ,
but we can n't claim that the roads do n't benefit us :
we all participate in the economy .
Building is something like 20 % of the economy .
To be sure , they are not paying enough .
None of us are , and to the extent we are not , all of us re being subsidized .
And where does the money for that subsidy come from ?
From the businesses we demonize and work for .
Until we have a tax structure where each of us pays our share , we ca n't very well complain about the newcomers or subsidies for someone else .
Schwartz 's claim that the new roads will do nothing for 99 % of the drivers in the region is a classic bad argument .
Under that criteria , nothing will ever be built anywhere .
That is pretty much the situation we have backed ourselves into :
build ahead of time and you are promoting sprawl and someone else 's profits , build late and you are not solving the problem .
What Anonymous 6:37 has n't figured out yet , is that special interests are actively working to make impossible what she has :
they would prefer that there be nothing there other than undisturbed and unmaintained land .
And she is making the same argument I have prevously made :
some commercial development makes it possible for people to work near where they live .
Sprawl , if you choose to call it that , makes it possible for more people to own and maintain , and pay the taxes on , what remains of our rural landscape .
To the extent that occurs , people like her wo n't need to travel much farther to work and clog roads that are already overdeveloped .
So , let 's get off the schtick of blaming everybody else :
it is not productive .
Our officials are stuck with the unenviable position of balancing opposing interests .
Nobody likes sprawl
and everyone supports conservation ,
but it is going to be expensive to achieve goals we all say we want .
Our officials are stuck with making their decision in the absence of any measurable criteria ,
and the special interests on both sides are so entrenched in their positions that someone will always be unhappy .
I frankly do n't think we know anywhere near enough to decide what the best use of transportation revenues is .
Even EMR says we know next to nothing about how we settle and live .
We should be working to give our oficials tools they can use to dispassionately make decisons that are best for all .
But using bad arguments against others that could equally well apply to ourselves does nothing to help the situation .
We should spend the energy and money studying what works and what does n't and understanding why and how to measure .
We can look at what works and what does n't and measure the characteristics of those places .
We should duplicate the ones that work and not duplicate the ones that do n't .
And we should expect to pay .
One thing we can be sure of , is that prosperity is a requirement of whatever works .
NoSprawlTax.org takes Til Hazel to task for his developments .
What they do n't point out is that Georgetown sits on the site of a former Hazel family farm .
They do n't point out that Hazel owns substantial property that is under conservation easement .
That is something you can not afford to do without prosperity behind you .
While NoSprawlTax rails against Hazel 's developments on the basis they are not wanted and they are bad for taxpayers , the fact reamins that they are all sold to taxpayers .
When you look at the Ballston Corridor , those high rises were essentially subdivided from property formerly owned as single family homes .
Those homes were sold because the owners could no longer hold on to them at the prices being offered and taxed at .
The situation is no different fo people that previously owned the parcels on the NoSrawlTax.org map .
I have no doubt the same thing will happen to me eventually .
The same thing may be happening to TMT .
When the time comes , both of us will sell to the highest bidder ,
and I do n't expect NoSprawlTax.org to be on the bidders ' list .
More likely , someone like Anonymous 6:37 will be .
Right after she buys , she will probably join NoSprawlTax.org .
There might be some other alternative ,
but whatever it is is going to cost money .
I sure hope it does n't come out of my pocket .
Ray - I 'm not endorsing anyone 's agenda by my reference to the web page
and I surely do n't begrudge anyone the ability to lobby for what they want .
I do , however , think that elected officials need to be willing to say `` no '' when they do n't think something makes good sense .
One of the most refreshing experiences is to have an elected official honestly tell you that he / she simply can not support your request because It 's too expensive or because he / she simply does not support the request .
What I and , hopefully , quite a few other Virginians want to see is our elected officials walk their talk .
This problem flows from the top on down .
Right , wrong or indifferent , Tim Kaine won office because he said `` we can not permit more development where the roads can not handle the traffic ''
and `` we can not pave our way out of this mess . ''
Yet , once in office , he jumps to the other side .
Reasonable people can argue that Kaine 's position that would limit the ability to develop one 's land was stupid or plain wrong .
But we should all agree that his running away from the very position that put him in office is disgraceful .
My engineer friends tell me that one can prioritize transportation projects based on what expenditures would produce the most improvement in traffic flow , etc.
Yet , that 's not how Virginia funds transportation infrastructure .
We do it based on lobbying the CTB .
What the NST map does show is that the goal of the sales tax referendum was mainly to build or expand roads near landholdings .
That is not improving transportation , but a group of investors seeking a subsidy .
-LRB- I have a good friend who attended a meeting in Richmond where a famous developer stood up and told the crowd that he built things and its was the taxpayers ' job to pay for the infrastructure to support whatever he built .
That 's the Virginia way . -RRB-
These landowners could offer to build or expand the roads near their properties .
Look at the roads that Disney and others built in Florida .
I do n't fault the landowners for trying .
I do fault those elected officials who fail to say `` no '' to projects that would not fix traffic problems .
My criticism is not just for roads , but also for extending Metro to Dulles at a huge cost that will not improve
The table shows several roads with LOS F that , after spending billions on Metro , are still LOS F .
Fixing traffic problems ?
Hardly .
Likewise , if we are in a transportation mess , why are n't our elected officials -- especially the Senate -- addressing VDOT 's total lack of internal cost controls ?
Walk the talk .
OK .
Now we agree .
Lobbying groups should be free to lobby .
But they had better bring an argument that is supportable as in `` prioritize transportation projects based on what expenditures would produce the most improvement in traffic flow '' and not as in `` its was the taxpayers ' job to pay for the infrastructure to support whatever he built '' , and not as in `` new roads will do nothing for 99 % of the drivers '' .
And officials should be free to say no when it does n't make any sense .
That goes for lobbyists on both sides of the fence .
Now , if we can just find some agreement on what does make sense ....
I agree that Metro to Dulles wo n't do a thing for traffic congestion ,
but I 'm not so sure it does n't make some sense by some other measure .
But clearly , using tolls to pay for Metro -LRB- instead of road improvements -RRB- while simultaneously claiming that cars and roads do n't pay their way is both nutso and egregiously unfair .
Those that benefit should pay , but at the same time , we ca n't make egregious statements about who benefits , or who does n't .
At some level , everybody benefits , but the benefits probably decrease rapidly with distance .
Whatever formula we come up with is going to be complex ,
but we ought to be able to come up with something that is a -RRB- measurable and b -RRB- makes enough sense so that all but the nut cases can see the sense in it .

Last tango in Paris
Paris was once the sex capital of the world .
But a crackdown on prostitution and the rise of porn megastores are destroying a unique , secret heritage .
Andrew Hussey reports
Every day of the week , from mid-morning until the early hours , the Club 88 on rue Saint - Denis in central Paris does a brisk trade .
From the outside at least , there is little to distinguish it from the dozen or so rival sex shops which line the streets in this part of Paris , in between the stalls flogging cheap hip - hop gear and drugs paraphernalia .
This part of the city has always had a seedy reputation .
Since the Middle Ages , it has been known as the haunt of hustlers , thieves and whores -
the street signs around here give the game away -LRB- la rue de la Grande Truanderie - `` the street of great criminality '' , named in the 15th century , is still home to evil - looking dope dealers -RRB- .
The upper end of rue Saint - Denis is lined day and night with prostitutes of all prices and races .
The lower end is less lively but nonetheless grim .
As recently as the 1970s , when the vast outdoor market of Les Halles was finally pulled down , it still enjoyed a reputation for gamey , sinful pleasures .
Now that Les Halles has been replaced by a shopping mall , this part of the city is avoided by most native Parisians and abandoned to tourists and banlieusards - the kids from the wretched council estates surrounding Paris who come here by a fast , direct train to get wrecked and cause low - level trouble .
The bleak surroundings make it all the more remarkable that Club 88 and its rival sex megastores have become the latest battlefield in Parisian culture wars .
On the one side are young intellectuals of -LRB- usually -RRB- the radical left who embrace porn , even in its wildest forms , as part of their libertarian philosophy .
This explains , for example , how Philippe Azoury for the ultra-hip magazine Les Inrockuptibles , evoking the writer and erotomaniac Georges Bataille as his guide , can - without any shred of irony - describe Club 88 as `` probably the best club in the world '' on the grounds that it offers both pleasure and excitement open to all .
A quick tour around Club 88 reveals the truth of this statement .
Although the exterior is discreet and vaguely stylish , inside , beyond the rows of standard specialist material -LRB- bestiality to coprophilia -RRB- , there is a labyrinth of cubicles , private rooms and viewing areas .
The central area is patrolled by girls , most of whom seem not to be French , but who cheerfully offer , in a variety of languages , a sex massage .
A Tannoy reminds the idling would - be customer that `` l' amour sur scene '' takes place at regular intervals if enough tickets are sold .
On the upper floors , which are dimly - lit and apparently designed to be as disorientating as possible , it is possible to see over 400 different porn films an hour on the multi-screen channels .
There are dungeons and ante-chambers to God knows what .
Business reaches a peak at lunch - times and in the early evening -
this is when you notice most of all the sociability and the buzz of the crowds -LRB- mostly male it has to be said but with a surprising number of couples , chatty lesbians and lone females -RRB- .
The sex megastore is now a staple feature in the famous red - light districts of Paris -LRB- other big names here include Scarlet and Sexodrome in Pigalle -RRB- .
However , despite the DVD viewing cabins , the lifts and escalators , the mumsy female staff and the credit - card friendly ambience which make them feel like a particularly kinky branch of Waterstones , they are not universally popular .
The problem here , the argument runs , is that there is nothing specifically `` Parisian '' about this environment .
More to the point , the rise of the sex megastore has gone hand - in - hand with Nicolas Sarkozy 's loudly stated mission to clean up the city .
This began in the summer of 2002 when Sarkozy , then Minister of the Interior , introduced harsh fines on streetwalkers around rue Saint - Denis .
Those he hit hardest were the independent working women , almost all of whom were native Parisian - working class women , known as les traditionelles -LRB- the traditional ones -RRB- .
These girls were also known as parigotes -LRB- a parigot is the rough Parisian equivalent of a cockney -RRB- and prized for their gouaille , a form of sarcastic wit .
The traditionelles of rue Saint - Denis found themselves driven out of the city centre by the harsh laws on street - walking .
Many were reduced to working out of vans parked at Porte Dauphine or Vincennes , hoping to pick up trade from passing motorists .
The newspaper Le Parisien reported angrily on the way on which these native Parisians were being driven out to be replaced by girls from sub-Saharan Africa run by gangs from Kosovo and Romania .
Le Parisien did its best to explain that its complaints were not driven by racism but that traditionelles were as Parisian as steak - frites , cheap red wine and Gauloises cigarettes , and , when they left , the city had lost a vital component of its underground culture .
The likes of `` Sandrine '' , who had worked rue Saint - Denis for nearly 20 years complained in the press that , not only was she being driven to penury , but that the city was losing part of its essential character .
She clearly hit a nerve ; the likes of Club 88 , it was argued by those who took up the traditionnelles ' defence , could be anywhere in Europe , from Barcelona to Hamburg .
At stake , it was further argued as the old generation of whores began to leave the city in droves , was the very soul of Paris itself .
It is easy to see this as a typically Gallic overstatement .
It is a fact , however , that the history of prostitution in Paris is , for many , inextricably linked to the political fortunes of the city .
This tradition can be traced to 18th - century Enlightenment ideology and the rise of a new class of thinkers , the libertins , who were avowedly atheist and sceptical about all other entrenched beliefs such as the power of monarchy .
During this period , the city swarmed with whores and to call for their suppression was to be in favour of Church and King and other superstitions .
The growth of widespread prostitution in Paris was paralleled by the rise of the new literary genre of pornography .
Much early pornography was entirely functional , providing a guide to well - known brothels , such as Le Gros Millan on rue du Beaujolais or Le Grand Balcon on rue de la Croix des Petits - Champs .
The genre soon became an entertainment in its own right and a great deal of police energy was wasted on pursuing printers , publishers and readers of work that was deemed to be anti-Christian and anti-social but which most Parisians found as life - enhancing as any of their other pleasures .
Popular titles such as The Nun in her Nightdress and John , The Fucker Debauched , were both bestsellers and intellectually respectable in the 18th - century city .
During the Revolution of 1789 , the Palais - Royal , the great colonnaded space then at the heart of the city , played host to nightly sex shows .
One of the special amusements in the brothels on the upper floors was the availability of sosies de vedette , whores who looked like or dressed up as famous women of the day .
Sexual activity only intensified during the height of the Terror , when the girls wore red , white and blue bonnets and offered a special price to the top members of the Assembly .
The real point was , of course , that liberty , equality and unbridled sexuality were all part of the indissoluble Rights of Man .
It is this tradition of mixing high political idealism and low carnal pleasures which informed the Parisian sexual underground of the 1920s and 1930s , which was documented by the likes of the philosopher Georges Bataille and the photographer Georges Brassai .
Bataille declared at the beginning of one of his most famous texts : `` whoever is afraid of whisky , naked girls and the obscene will never understand my philosophy '' .
The erotic life of the city during this period - when the likes of Bataille and his friends and lovers -LRB- the poet Colette Peignot , who was his lover and intellectual muse was an eager participant in these adventures -RRB- could buy a whole orgy at one of the clubs on rue Saint - Denis - was beautifully photographed by Brassai and enhanced Paris 's reputation as a city of endless erotic powers .
This subterranean sexual city was effectively wiped out by 1946 , when the authorities , disgusted by the close relationships between brothel owners and the occupying German forces , shut down more than 180 of the notorious maison closes - the legal brothels scattered throughout the city , but especially clustered around rue Saint - Denis .
This was done on the orders of the politician Marthe Richard , who had herself been a prostitute and spy .
These establishments , including such famous names as Le Chabanais -LRB- which dated back to 1820 -RRB- , Le Sphinx , Le One Two Two -LRB- this has survived into the 21st century as a swingers ' club -RRB- , were not only a part of Parisian folklore but had stood as elaborate and rich monuments to all forms of human sexual activity .
Somewhere such as Le Sphinx or Le One Two Two not only offered the regular forms of coupling that could be bought all over the city , but specialised in `` shows '' and `` spectacles '' constructed to the whim of clients , who dined well in the attached restaurants as a prelude to more carnal pleasures .
The debates around the closure of the brothels are still , surprisingly , very much a live issue in Paris .
One of the most powerful cases made in favour of them has been regularly made since the early 1990s by Michele Barzach , the Conservative ex-minister for health , who argued for controlled brothels , both gay and straight , as a way of dealing with Aids .
The enemies of this coalition are , however , surprisingly not all the puritans of the Right or the `` new Left '' -LRB- although Segolene Royal , the Socialist Party 's president - in - waiting does campaign on an anti-porn agenda -RRB- .
They are also often artists and writers , usually of an older generation .
More to the point , they too would describe themselves as keen on sexual transgression if not as downright erotomaniacs .
They include the likes of Yves Trentret , the academic and satirical novelist , who deplores the commercialised , `` industrial erotica '' of rue Saint - Denis .
`` I am of a generation that can just remember the erotic life of Paris as it was , '' he says when we meet in a mainly Algerian bar , L' Aec en ciel , in the 13th arrondissement , which has a stock of mainly Arab whores , `` But that way of life has gone for ever .
Paris was once known throughout the world as the capital of sex , but even if foreigners come now , they do not find what they are looking for .
For me , it is worse still that the younger generation who celebrate hard - core porn do not seem to realise that they are celebrating hard - core values , and that these are the values of hard - core , globalised capitalism . ''
This is also an argument made by the film director and porn actress Ovidie , who came to national prominence in France in 2002 with her book Porno Manifesto , a polemic in defence of porn .
Ovidie 's big idea then was that everyday Parisian life had been invaded by `` porno chic '' - the use of pornographic imagery in advertising - and that this was a betrayal of the intentions of those who , like her , both used prostitutes and made `` real porn '' .
I was then writing a book about Paris which , among other things , set out to cover the underground sexuality of the city
and , inspired by her call for a return to older Parisian traditions of sexual experience , I went to speak to Ovidie for the first time on a chilly September morning in a cafe near rue Saint - Denis .
In those days , Ovidie was tiny , pierced and dressed in black pyjamas like a junior Maoist . She began by quoting the contemporary thinkers Jean Baudrillard , Georges Bataille and Guy Debord , who , all in different ways , made the case for sexual freedom , and cited the popularity of porn in pre-Revolutionary Paris , before explaining her notion that , because it is based on a universal need , in the right hands , `` porn can set you free '' .
Ovidie went on :
pornography , she said , was about nothing more than the promise of human happiness .
The physical and economic exploitation that are undeniably involved in the sex industry , she said , are wrong only because they are a betrayal of this original , quite innocent trust .
The exploitation of women in particular , she said , was a betrayal of the original liberating aims of 18th - century pornography .
It was this egalitarian philosophy that Ovidie claimed to recapture in her work .
This did not preclude payment : indeed quite the opposite .
`` I have sex for money , '' Ovidie said ,
'' and , of course , that demands respect . ''
I met Ovidie again a few weeks back in Neuilly , the posh part of Paris where she now lives - presumably having made a packet from her films with titles like Orgie en Noir and Lilith .
It was three years since we had last met and she was now a mother .
She was also a little heftier around the edges but still with a definitive view on her own activities and the present state of sex in the city .
`` The problem is with Paris itself , and probably France itself , '' she told me .
`` They are both changing for the worse .
Parisians are unhappy
and that is expressed in their sexuality .
A place like rue Saint - Denis represents everything that has gone wrong -
it is not a place to go and have sex happily , as a person or as a couple .
It is now just gangsters and girls who are sex slaves from Eastern Europe and Africa .
The myths of the orgies to be found there , that you read in Georges Bataille , may not have been entirely true
but they did correspond to some form of reality .
Now it is practically impossible to have good sex with strangers in Paris . ''
We talked of the vogue for echangisme -LRB- '' swinging '' -RRB- which was in vogue in Paris in the late 1990s and - as famously documented in the memoirs of Catherine Millet and the novels of Michel Houellebecq - is far from being the naff and suburban activity that it is in Great Britain , was briefly the height of Parisian chic .
`` I know of some echangistes clubs that are still charming and passionate , '' Ovidie says ,
`` but really all that too has gone .
Catherine Millet is intelligent but her work is boring .
And Michel Houellebecq is not Georges Bataille -
he is really a moralist and his work does not celebrate sex like Bataille but condemns it .
So why read Houellebecq or Millet ?
I think the problem is political .
French people despair of the future - which is unstable and dark - and they are too morose to have sex properly . ''
The conversation moves on to a discussion of rising violence in the suburbs , a disintegrating economy and the lack of a political solution .
But notwithstanding the prevailing gloomy moods in the city , individual Parisians still take a chauvinistic pride in their horror of prudery .
They still lament on the pages of Le Parisien not only how the old - style whores are being driven from the city but how , over centuries , people 's pleasures have been policed by town - planning .
As the city was made more `` modern '' in the 19th century , for example , it was also governed by public prudery .
The first and clearest sign of this was the changing of street names in the brothel - ridden streets of Saint - Denis and Les Halles .
In 1809 , rue Tire - Boudin -LRB- '' Sausage - Puller street '' -RRB- became rue Marie - Stuart ;
rue Trousse - Nonain , or `` Tumble - Nun street '' , already disguised in official documents as Tasse - Nonian , became rue Beaubourg ;
rue de la Pute - y - muse , or `` Idling Tart street '' , became Petit - muse , while the scatological collection of rues Merdeuses , Merdelet , Chieurs and Chiards all disappeared from Haussmann 's new maps of the rational and hygienic city .
Nowadays , one of the last bastions of a uniquely Parisian approach to sex is Le Beverly , the only true porno cinema in the city centre , which , over the past few years , has been regularly preparing to close its doors for the last time .
This cinema stands at the top edge of the red - light district of rue Saint - Denis , almost but not quite in the rapidly gentrifying area of Montorgueil St - Denis .
Over the door , there is a photograph of the poet Rimbaud and his famous line `` Il faut reinventer l 'amour '' -LRB- '' Love must be reinvented '' -RRB- .
A poster in felt - tip pen offers special rates for couples on Thursday nights .
Most of the old - style porno cinemas in Paris were swept away in the 1980s , victims of the booming video trade and the regular appearance of hard - core porn on mainstream television .
Le Beverly somehow struggled through the 1990s .
Most of the customers who now come are visibly die - hards .
Some of them looked too old to be even interested in sex .
Perhaps they come for companionship and out of loyalty .
Others look sinister and sheepish in equal measure .
A handful of third - world immigrants sit back in their seats , smoking .
Le Beverly has never been respectable - the atmosphere in the pitch - black salle de spectacle is tense and fervid , with more than a hint of real physical danger .
But to visit this place , in all its sleazy glory , is to take a trip to a bygone era : a time - maybe this was the 1960s or 1970s - when showing sex in a public space was a real transgression and possibly a real thrill .
These days , as a short stroll down rue Saint - Denis or through the back streets of Pigalle - where porn DVDs are on sale at knock - down rates - reveals the opposite is true .
I left the Beverly intrigued but not quite convinced by Ovidie 's argument that writing or screening sex is in itself a genuinely subversive statement of wilful and unrepentant erotic intent .
This may have been the case in the 18th century , or even in the 1970s ,
but , nowadays , I felt the vision of the writer Michel Houellebecq - who , in one of his poems , brilliantly describes , with appalled precision , the deadly routine of the hand - jobs and peep - shows available to fit in with the office hours of the central city - was indeed a more grimly accurate vision of 21st - century Paris .
`` Our civilisation suffers from vital exhaustion , '' Houellebecq writes elsewhere ,
`` We need adventure and eroticism because we need to hear ourselves repeat that life is marvellous and exciting ;
and it 's abundantly clear that we rather doubt this . ''
Paris is evidently no longer the capital of sex
but it is mutating into something else ; an international sex theme park .
As I walked away from Club 88 and then Le Beverly , it seemed to me that this theory explained the strangely drab and haunted faces on the whores I passed at the top end of rue Saint - Denis .

our most epic road trips
writing about the black canyon left me thinking of other ' epic ' climbing road trips i 've actually survived .
and this , of course , brought back memories that made me suddenly laugh out loud in inappropriate places .
first among them while standing in line at some typically dull so - cal caffeine-o-torium waiting to beg for my morning fix :
i suddenly started laughing so hard i was like snorting out minor body parts through my nose .
suffice to say that all the local Rotarians and VFW heroes so desperate as to have voluntarily rocketed down to their local strip mall before dawn backed away from me hard , then stared at me like i had suddenly dropped my pants and started , er , ' amusing myself ' in a public place .
-LRB- i know that specific look because i once ...
um , never mind -RRB-
so anyway , it dawned on me as all those oh - so - serious professionals back peddled away from me , i bet that there are oodles of absolute pant - wetter road trip stories lingering out there among my brothers and sisters on the . wreck ripe just ripe for the picking --
if only they were inspired to show and tell all .
~~~
so i ask you , what was your most epic road trip ?
do tell ...
~~~
i chose the word `` epic '' with some care .
for what we 're looking for here is not necessarily your best road trip ever
-LRB- ie , `` so we met up just after work and got there early ,
then we climbed everything on our wish list on our first try , then drove home without incident ... '' --
good for you , but hardly worth writing , or reading .
at the other extreme , your worst road trip ever would hardly warrant a recap ,
-LRB- ie , `` `` my prom date called and dumped me ,
then the other two clowns finally showed up hammered and four hours late .
and 10 minutes out of town , we blew a head gasket ... '' --
this also hardly worth writing , or reading .
we 're looking for epic ,
the best story you ever stumbled through and survived .
something with drunken rodeo clowns , the ' professional lady ' named Larry you met in the overnight lot at that truck stop , angry state troopers , blood everywhere , ...
you know , that kind of thing .
do , pray , tell all .
i promise to only laugh at the punch lines .
and i promise to fess up eventually and tell of at least one such epic i survived --
that is once you big kids have me laughing so hard i forget about all those ancient blood oaths i swore never to say a word ...

well ... it began with blowing out a tire but then drifted into I - might - tell - you - one - day territory ... but ended with driving back from Newhalem to Seattle with me holding my breath to lighten the load on the replacement tire , an exercise deriving from a state of mind which helps to keep one awake .
There was also a time when I agreed to atomic mouse 's suggestion to follow a watercourse near Sabie downhill one afternoon .
It was him , me , 'Nita , and my 8 year old daughter and 10 year old son .
Down and down we went wading through the sparkling water , first broad and shallow then narrow with deep pools .
I 'm certain that neither a.m. or myself will ever lose the sharp frozen second as 'Nita put her head under water and then threw it back with her long hair and an arc of water saying youth and grace in perfect agreement .
And sexy .
Then more descent , sometimes through the jungle on either side to bypass falls .
Now it was getting dark .
It was cold .
Sometimes the stream bottom dropped away and we fell in over our heads .
There was whimpering from all except 'Nita , our rock of unshakable womanly determination .
Just as the last light faded we made it to the place where a trail left the water and led back to the car now a couple hundred meters above us .
Only a.m. had not foreseen the chance that the escape he used the last time could have become overgrown with brambles .
He was sent off into the dark to find another way , which he did ,
and although at times one of us had to do a step of 5th class and then reach back for the children standing on the shoulders of the other , we made the all - important deadline of finding an open restaurant before 9 pm .
'Nita was composed and lovely in the candlelight ,
the children were glad to be alive ,
a.m. spun his tales ,
and I put off tick removal until morning .
That was the end to a day which had offered many other adventures , the scariest for me being a swim in a stream -LRB- a different stream -RRB- to rinse off the red mud of a cave .
Scary because I had doubts about reassurances of safety issuing from a companion who admitted to several bouts with bilharzia and tick fever .
After reading dogboy 's Black Canyon post I had the same thought he did ; that there must be other such stories .
I 've already told most of mine .
However , after watching Dr. Nigel Spivey tell us How Art Made the World -LRB- ''It is n't every day you walk around with a 16 -LRB- or 60 ? -RRB- million dollar piece of limestone in your hand . '' -RRB- I learn that I 've re-discovered a 40,000 year - old trick of story - telling .
Use a soundtrack .
So in a recurring offer , to anyone who provides a mailing address , I will send a set of QuickTime slide shows that are guaranteed to make you laugh , whether with me or at me .
Just please use decent sound , something with sub-woofer if possible .
Andy Cairns
So nice seeing an experience from another perspective , thanks Andy .
That was some time ago
but i 'm glad to see that it has 'nt blunted your memory of the day .
I do however have the disconcerting feeling that you read my diary though .
I quite think the blouberg trip we went on deserving of epic status .
-LRB- Strange thing that ; have you ever noticed how some times it 's more like the trip going on you ? -RRB-
like the trip going on you ? -RRB-
like the trip going on you ? -RRB-
The scale of the adventure that awaited us must have been evident to you as we started out on the trip , since you took 2 beacon sparkles as emergency rations , instead of just 1 .
Still ; the view from the top was all the better for the road we chose -LRB- or guessed -RRB- to get there .
Atomic Mouse
brothers cairns and mouse , in the same time zone at the same time , ah the very thought of just that absolutely screams epic .
having been more than once strung out 30+ feet above some rusty spinner of a paleo bolt-ette in the calanques , way way over my head and doing my bad elvis impersonation , i can easily imagine a truly priceless handful of limestone .
hell , even just a tiny little crimper 's worth .
yeeesh ...
having said that , i saw that said same Dr. Spivey piece on PBS -- a while ago at some no - tell -LRB- '' Big Earl 's Stop - N - Flop '' , if memory serves -RRB-
the tv was chained to the wall ,
and i assure you there was no remote .
that and the sheets were the consistency of waxed paper .
after i woke / sobered up , i found this one ruby red stiletto heeled slipper that was big even on me .
my first thought was `` cool , i wonder if i can find the other one . ''
moments later my second thought was `` oooch , i think need to shower immediately , then touch nothing ... ''
well , at least the price was right .
for the guy behind the -LRB- bullet proof glass -- big earl himself ? -RRB- at first said ' 50 bucks an hour . '
then i said ' um , how much for all night ? '
at which he looked at me really funny and said ' er , fifty bucks ' .
and i said ' well -- can i see the room first ?
at which he looked at me really really funny and said ' ok , how 'bout 18 bucks . '
at which i said ' deal ! '
then i said ' er , i assume you want cash '
to which he said ' D' YAH THINK !? '
you laugh , but when was the last time you rented a no - tell room for less than 20 bucks -LRB- that 's a night -- not an hour , lord slime -RRB-
that or found a free size 12 -LRB- mens ' , EE wide -RRB- ruby red slipper ?
that or had some drunken squid who just happened to also have a key to your room suddenly crash in in the middle of the night , flip the mattress over -LRB- with you on it -- well , suddenly not on it -RRB- , then calmly scoop up the revealed colt '45 and say `` oh , i 'm sorry to wake you , you want a beer ? ''
well i rest my case .
or , as warren harding once said : `` At either end of the social spectrum , there lies a leisure class . ''
ok , i 've since been told it is properly attributed to eric beck .
but i met harding once , late in his life -LRB- though neither of us dreamed that at the time -RRB- by an ' unauthorized ' campfire under cloud 's rest .
and he said just that to me .
and if there was ever anyone who would understand that line , it was harding .
or at least the harding i met .
before that night , i had taken my pals ' word for it and believed i was entirely nuts and a really good climber .
after that night , i realized i was n't all that especially nuts , nor was i all that especially much of a climber .
warren was magically , well , different .
trust me on this , if nothing else .
~~~
so where was i ...
oh yeah , Dr. Spivey .
and neanderthals .
-LRB- and warren harding -RRB-
neanderthals are dear to me , for they are surely my tribe
-LRB- if you 'd ever been to a wedding within my clan down at the elk 's lodge , you 'd know -RRB- .
i 've read a lot about them , one of my favorite repasts .
now most of our subspecies assume that just because we happened to eek past them in Darwin 's sieve , they were dopes .
ah but not so --
just look at the archeology .
for big science has found burials surrounded by literally pounds of pollen .
as in flowers , piles of them .
the fact that there was any burial at , to my mind , speaks volumes of them .
add the flowers , and well , to my mind , that 's poetry .
oh if only they had a written language --
well , one that we can find .
big science has also found burials of neanderthal elders -LRB- ie , like 50+ - a near miracle then , albeit it no more than late adolescence now -RRB- -- who had demonstrably been brutally hobbled since early childhood .
like broken hips , femurs , even -LRB- in one case -RRB- a snapped spine -- all trauma endured as children as now easily proved given ' modern ' techniques .
and yet they survived another 40 years to be buried in mounds of flowers .
how did that happen ?
or more to the point , why ?
we call them ' cavemen ' and relinquish them to ape status .
why ?
of late i 've come to ask if i 'd rather be surrounded by neanderthals or the graduating class of the stanford mba program .
the answer comes surprisingly easy .
~~~
um right , ok , what else .
clearly The Gods read my last post and were obviously inspired to offer still more inspiration for reflection on the epic road trip front -LRB- nudge nudge -RRB- via the morning news .
first They offered word of astronut Lisa Nowak 's epic road trip from houston -LRB- Mission Control even , oh purrfect , well done Zeus -RRB- to Orlando .
i personally nominate Nowak for . wreck road trip points in both the technique and packing list categories .
the former for dreaming up an idea sure to revolutionize road trips -- wearing a diaper to avoid the need for pit stops and hence shave precious seconds off travel time .
genius !
why did n't i think of that ?
i for one am off to bobmart for a carton of Depends .
sure hope i get there before all the frustrated LA commuters buy up all the national inventory .
as for Nowak 's packing list , according to CNN it included : a wig , sunglasses , a trench coat , several large plastic garbage bags , a half dozen latex gloves , MapQuest directions , `` diapers Nowak said she wore to reduce stops along the highway '' , a wad of undelivered love letters , and oh yeah , about $ 600 in cash
imagine all the fun one could have with all that stuff .
beats even the contents of the `` Plan R Survival Kit '' Slim Pickins ' inventories in Dr. Stranglove .
suffice to say all of the above are now on my bobmart shopping list .
it 's the rubber tubing part that i suspect is really giving the woman Nowak `` just wanted to talk to '' a whopping case of the heebie geebies .
`` Hell hath no fury ... ''

the morning news also included mention of the passing of Frankie Lane , the man who gave us what is certainly the best road trip tune ever -- `` Rawhide ! ''
i remember while howling back from a long weekend in Squamish , after listening to the mighty original a few times with all the windows down -LRB- this in order to invoke a much needed second wind at about 3am on I -RRB- i crooned a variation on this deathless standard to inspire my then sweetheart -LRB- and still dear pal -RRB- who was cramming for an organic chem final
-LRB- she had carried her notes with her all weekend , even had her head buried in them while belaying me on Grand Wall .
a real confidence builder to look down from the shaky crux and see that .
ah yeeesh -RRB-
'' Bondin' bondin' bondin' keep that carbon bondin' FORMALDEHYDE !!!! -LRB- & etc -RRB- ''
my beloved abby was , oddly , not amused .
she loudly invoked the wrath of The Gods -LRB- see above -RRB- down upon my pointy little head .
and , remarkably , she got it .
for seconds later there was this tuly blinding flash as lightning hit an unlucky tree just a few hundred in front of us and off on the side of the road .
and the thunderous crash that followed shook us into the adjoining lane .
that and no more than a minute later , as i attempted to slither between two of those big open stake trucks they use to haul live cattle , there was yet another mighty blast of lightning close by .
this apparently caused a whole lot of tightly packed cows to suddenly and simultaneously group - shit themselves , as we were instantly enveloped in the mother of all shit storms .
literally .
it was so thick my windshield wipers just stopped .
it got suddenly pitch black inside the car as every inch of glass was buried in cow shit .
this at , um , 12 hours divided by two , times five , plus about 65 equals , um , something like 95 mph .
caught tight between two tractor trailers howling -LRB- bleating ? -RRB- down some steep pass somewhere in southern oregon .
suffice to say i nearly shit myself as well .
for i could do nothing but take my foot off the gas , aim kinda straight , and start chanting from the tibetan book of the dead .
abby , always the cool head , rolled down her window -LRB- and was immediately rewarded with a lapful of still warm poop -RRB- , allowing me to slither over onto the shoulder of the road in an almost controlled manner .
there we used a snow scraper , all was left in our water bottles -LRB- not much - for who would have anticipated _that_ -RRB- , a big unopened jug of gatorade , and a bottle of nondescript chardonnay to clear just enough of a porthole in the mighty poop wad on the windshield to allow us to actually find , then limp into , ashland .
there we sat at this dark gas station with a drive through car wash waiting for it to open .
abby again immersed in her org chem book , seemingly nonplussed , me thwapping my head against the steering wheel chanting `` this is n't happening ... ''
when the guy -LRB- the owner , it turned out -RRB- arrived to open the gas station , he took one look at our cow pie with wheels and said `` what the fook ? ''
then he noticed we were parked at the mouth of his drive through car wash and said `` there 's no _way_ i 'm gon na let you use my car wash ! ''
though in the end he proved not to be a complete turd -- as he gave us detailed directions to his competitor 's coin operated self serve / self spray car wash on the other side of town .
that and broke our remaining 40 bucks of cash into a half ton of quarters .
and we used every last quarter , for panicked cow cow - poop is like epoxy -- if you did n't already know that ...

sure , you 're all

Blouberg was epic on my scale , involving as it did a King , a big snake , Germans and a policeman disappearing on the mountain , advice on how to kill a python , and bears some relevance to the recent thread on getting lost

, oh , yeah , and the guy looking for his cow with a hatchet , but the epic status was compromised when we were descending the mountain and met the schoolgirls coming up it on their way home .
I do n't think any part of that trip translates well to North American experiences , except for the thunderstorm coming on just as we were near a cave .
But the real assignment was on road trips . ^,,^ would probably find any trip you ever made in The Slut to be of interest .

And that was when you were finally a peace with the decision to not buy a convertable , was n't it ?
- s -
January 1966 .
In Nigeria a civil war was going on .
I was a correspondent covering the war .
On a cloudy day I left Lagos .
I was driving along a road where they say no white man can come back alive . I was driving to see if a white man could , because I had to experience everything for myself .
I know that a man shudders in the forest when he passes close to a lion .
I got close to a lion so that I would know how it feels .
I had to do it myself because I knew that no one could describe it to me .
And I can not describe it myself .
Nor can I describe a night in the Sahara .
The stars over the Sahara are enormous .
They sway above the sand like great chandeliers .
The light of those stars is green .
Night in the Sahara is as green as a Mazowsze* meadow .
I drove up a hill
and when I got to the crest I could see the first flaming roadblock down below .
Burning logs blocked the road .
I slowed down and then stopped ;
it would have been impossible to have carried on .
I could see a dozen or so young people .
Some had shotguns ,
some were holding knives
and the rest were armed with machetes .
They were dressed alike in blue shirts with white sleeves , the colours of the opposition , of the UPGA .
They wore black and white caps with the letters UPGA .
They had pictures of Chief Awolowo pinned to their shirts .
Chief Awolowo was the leader of the opposition , the idol of the party .
They must have been smoking hashish because their eyes were mad
and they did not look fully conscious .
They were soaked in sweat , seemed possessed , frenzied .
They descended on me and pulled me out of the car .
I could hear them shouting ' UPGA ! UPGA ! '
On this road UPGA ruled .
UPGA held me in its sway .
I could feel three knife points against my back
and I saw several machetes aimed at my head .
Two activists stood a few steps away , pointing their guns at me in case I tried to get away .
My African experience had taught me that the worst thing to do in such situations is to betray your despair .
The most important thing was keeping still .
Keeping still takes practice and willpower , because everything inside screams that you should run for it or jump the other guy .
But they are always in groups and that means certain death .
I had to cover all my weaknesses , hide them somewhere very deep within myself .
This was Africa ,
I was in Africa .
They did not know that I was not their enemy .
They knew that I was white ,
and the only white they had known was the colonizer , who abased them .
The ones standing in the road wanted cash .
They wanted me to join the party , to become a member of UPGA and to pay for it .
I gave them five shillings .
That was too little , because somebody hit me on the back of the head .
I felt pain in my skull .
In a moment there was another blow .
After the third blow I felt an enormous tiredness .
I was fatigued and sleepy ;
I asked how much they wanted .
They wanted five pounds .
Everything in Africa was getting more expensive .
In the Congo soldiers were accepting people into the party for one pack of cigarettes and one blow with a rifle butt .
But here I had already got it a couple of times
and I was still supposed to pay five pounds .
I must have hesitated because the boss shouted to the activists , ' Burn the car ! '
and that car , the Peugeot that had been carrying me around Africa , was not mine .
It belonged to the Polish state .
One of them splashed gasoline on the Peugeot .
I understood that the discussion had ended and I had no way out .
I gave them the five pounds .
They started fighting over it .
But they allowed me to drive on .
Two boys moved the burning logs aside .
I looked around .
On both sides of the road there was a village and the village crowd had been watching the action .
The people were silent ;
somebody in the crowd was holding up a UPGA banner .
They all had photographs of Chief Awolowo pinned on their shirts .
I liked the girls best .
They were naked to the waist and had the name of the party written across their breasts : UP on the right breast , and GA on the left one .
I started off .
I could not turn back ;
they allowed me only to go forward .
So I kept driving through a country at war , a cloud of dust behind me .
The landscape was beautiful here , all vivid colours ,
Africa the way I like it .
Quiet , empty - every now and then a bird taking flight in the path of the car .
Now I knew the price :
UPGA had demanded five pounds of me .
I had less than five pounds left , and fifty kilometres to go .
I passed a burning village and then an emptying village , people fleeing into the bush .
Two goats grazed by the roadside and smoke hung above the road .
Beyond the village there was another burning roadblock .
Activists in UPGA uniforms , knives in their hands , were kicking a driver who did not want to pay his membership fee .
Nearby stood a bloody , beaten man -
he had n't been able to come up with the dues , either .
Everything looked like the first roadblock .
At this one , though , I had n't even managed to announce my desire to join UPGA before I received a pair of hooks to the midsection and had my shirt torn .
They turned my pockets out and took all my money .
I was waiting for them to set me on fire , because UPGA was burning many people alive .
I had seen the burnt corpses .
The boss at this roadblock popped me one in the face
and I felt a warm sweetness in my mouth .
Then he poured benzene on me ,
because here they burn people in benzene :
it guarantees complete incineration .
I felt an animal fear , a fear that struck me with paralysis ;
I stood rooted to the ground , as if I was buried up to the neck .
I could feel the sweat flowing over me ,
but under my skin I was as cold as if standing naked in sub-zero frost .
I wanted to live , but life was abandoning me .
I wanted to live , but I did not know how to defend my life .
My life was going to end in inhuman torment .
My life was going to go out in flames .
The boss of the operation stuffed my money into his pocket and shouted at me , blasting me with his beery breath : ' Power !
UPGA must get power !
We want power !
UPGA is power ! '
He was shaking , swept up in the passion of power ;
he was mad on power ;
the very word ' power ' sent him into ecstasy , into the highest rapture .
His face was flooding sweat ,
the veins on his forehead were bulging
and his eyes were shot with blood and madness .
He was happy
and he began to laugh in joy .
They all started laughing .
That laughter saved me .
They ordered me to drive on .
About four kilometres down the road the third roadblock was burning .
The road was straight
and I could see the smoke a long way off ,
and then I saw the fire and the activists .
I could not turn back .
There were two barriers behind me .
I could only go forward .
I was trapped , falling out of one ambush into another .
But now I was out of money for ransom ,
and I knew that if I did n't pay up they would burn the car .
Above all , I did n't want another beating .
I had been whipped , my shirt was in tatters
and I reeked of benzene .
There was only one way out : to run the roadblock .
It was risky because I might wreck the car or it might catch fire .
But I had no choice .
I floored it .
The roadblock was a kilometre ahead .
The speedometer needle jumped : 110 , 120 , 140 .
The car shimmied
and I gripped the wheel more tightly .
I leaned on the horn .
When I was right on top of it I could see that the bonfire stretched all the way across the road .
The activists were waving their knives for me to stop .
I saw that two of them were winding up to throw bottles of gasoline at the car
and for a second I thought , so , this is the end ,
this is the end ,
but there was no turning back .
There was no turning ...
I smashed into the fire ,
the car jumped ,
there was a hammering against the belly pan ,
sparks showered over the windshield .
And suddenly - the roadblock , the fire and the shouting were behind me .
The bottles had missed .
Hounded by terror I drove another kilometre
and then I stopped to make sure the car was n't on fire .
It was n't on fire .
I was all wet .
All my strength had left me ;
I was incapable of fighting ;
I was wide open , defenceless .
I sat down on the sand and felt sick to my stomach .
Everything around me was alien .
An alien sky and alien trees . Alien hills and manioc fields .

A Toll Road in U.S. 460 's Future
Private industry is showing interest in financing and building a new U.S. 460 , Peter Bacque with the Richmond Times - Dispatch is reporting .
Tidewater Skanska , a subsidiary of Swedish construction giant Skanska AB , has committed to making a proposal to improve the 55 - mile highway between U.S. 58 in Suffolk and Interstate 295 near Petersburg .
The Virginia Department of Transportation , which is orchestrating the project , is hoping for at least two competing proposals .
With no public money available , improvements would have to be financed through tolls .
The problem is that the market seems unlikely to support the $ 9.70 per vehicle it would cost to travel the full length of the road .
Needless to say , residents of hamlets like Zuni and Wakefield who use 460 as a local thoroughfare will be none too happy with paying tolls every time they pull onto the road .
To offset sky - high tolls , Bacque says , VDOT is encouraging innovative financing schemes such as supporting `` economic development opportunities . ''
Bacque did not enumerate those opportunities in his article ,
but they could well be tied to major port expansions slated for Hampton Roads .
Moffat & Nichol , an engineering consulting firm , prepared a study for the Virginia Port Authority last year advocating development of a major intermodal park off U.S. 460 as a way to handle an anticipated 900,000 additional containers annually expected to move through the ports .
Those containers would require between 20 million and 60 million square feet of additional distribution space , employ 9,000 people directly and generate $ 788 million in wages from direct and indirect jobs .
I 'm normally a big fan of toll - driven projects on the principle that users should pay for transportation improvements .
And I 'm all in favor of a project that would enable the expansion of Virginia 's ports and improve employment prospects for the rural Southside counties along U.S. 460 .
But I 'm also wary of the potential for an upgraded U.S. 460 to act as a wick for the expansion of more hop - scotch , disconnected , low - density development out of Hampton Roads -- a pattern of development that would negate many of the benefits of the economic development .
If the Kaine administration wants to align transportation and land use planning , a good place to start would be with projects , like this one , that emanate from the administration itself .
Any evaluation of the competing proposals needs to consider the impact not just on traffic counts and toll financing but local human settlement patterns .
The `` good '' part about private investor toll roads is that real money is riding on the `` demand '' calculation and when real money is involved , less likely that the predicted demand data will be `` cooked '' to justify the road .
The `` bad '' part is that VDOT is still involved and I 'm sure will find new ways to screw things up .
The `` ugly '' needs some explanation
and I 'll use the History Channel 's show on the first national railroad .
Pointed out in that program that the `` incentives '' for attracting private investment to build the rail was `` free land '' to those who built the rail .
So take a private investor .. any private investor who `` proposes '' to build a major road - like 460 - and folks will fall all over themselves about their good fortune ...
but consider ... if those same investors - at the same time they were building the road - were also buying up land to develop - that would be more easily developable because of the new road ?
Now .. the investors .. I 'm quite sure would be saying the same words that we hear now days ...
that they are ONLY responding to a demand .. they did not create it . :--RRB-
other views ?
So your point is that if private money is developing the roads and private money is developing the land then government loses control over the plan .
Furthermore the infrastructure is privately owned so they can gouge all they want .
Sounds like a plan .
All we need is enough speculators to make it work .
Ray , your explanation sounds good to me .
Developing US 460 and linking it to a rail and road crossing from the Port of Norfolk is the way to take traffic off I on The Peninsula .
One would hope that some kind of safeguards have been put into the Va Public - Private Law to deal with this potential .
Overall , I am a supporter of private investor toll roads - PROVIDED they utilize ORT - open road -LRB- electronic -RRB- tolling so that only those who refuse to obtain transponders have to stop at toll plazas .
The comment on rail is interesting because some of the opponents of expanding I would like to see parallel rail facilities so that the scope and scale of improving of I might be more modest .
So .. connecting the dots .. Rail on I that connects to rail on I ... :--RRB-
Here 's some further thoughts for whatever they might be worth .. or not .
Let 's start with the premise that increased population and new jobs means more people who need a place to live .
Let 's further specify that many folks who accept the population - growth realities are still , none - the - less not happy with the settlement patterns that result from free - market responses to the housing demand .
Let 's finally specify that one of the major agnsts with regard to folks ' views with respect to settlement patterns - is the impacts on the transportation network - in the form of increased traffic and congestion on roads not designed to handle such increased volumes AND no money available to upgrade them anytime soon .
So ... enter a private investor who agrees to build not only a TOLL road , but develop land to serve the housing demand - AND ... what he -LRB- she -RRB- develops IS .. in fact , New Urban , compact developments .
So , in doing so - the developer solves three problems :
1 . - provides needed new housing
2 . - provides efficient compact development that includes bike and ped and mixed - use format .
3 . - provides the road capacity to serve the new developments -LRB- via a new toll road -RRB- .
... Why would such a thing be a bad thing ?
Larry Gross : You already have rail - coal and Amtrak along old US 60 / I 64 on the Peninsula .
The idea is rail on the Southside to take the Port of Norfolk containers .
I always thought high speed on The Peninsula connecting to Richmond and DC was the ticket ,
but I was told by folks who know better than me that the cost of upgrading or adding to the existing tracks -LRB- bringing coal to the NN port -RRB- and running pokey old Amtrak would take a lot of lot of lot money .
There may not be the case for companies to do it .
hmm ...
but WHERE are those Port of Norflolk containers headed to ?
re : new rail / private investors
I 've always wondered WHY private rail can not compete with public roads for the transportation of goods .
I 've heard LOTs of explanations .. but du n no that I 've ever seen a clear analysis .
For that matter .. I 've never seen a comparison betwen what the costs are for one mile of rail right - of - way vs one mile of 18 - wheeler - capable highway right - of - way .. much less the comparative operating costs between a load of goods transported by rail vs road .
But my point is ... rails wo n't be used instead of roads unless / until they are superior in terms of cost and effectiveness -LRB- movement of goods from point a to point b -RRB-
I can see where .. at some point goods MUST travel by truck because rail simply can not go everywhere that our road network does
but when we still transfer goods across the country - by truck .. verses rail .. the obvious question is why ?
And my ignorance ... leaves me with `` well , presumedly , the company that needed the goods shipped would not have chosen the more expensive method '' .
... and if it is cheaper to move goods across the company by truck .. then why would we expect moving goods across Virginia to be any cheaper ?
.... all things being equal ... which I doubt seriously is the case .
Lost in the hyperbole coming from Hampton Roads about `` tolls '' being the only way to save our so - called `` transportation crisis '' is any factual information about `` tolls '' .
Toll roads are 4 times more costly to run , than by using the gas tax .
And in fact in Virginia it will cost even more as there is no big bureaucracy in place to administer it .
Got to staff all those toll booths .
Health insurance , retirement funds , sick leave , uniforms , and a huge HR department to make sure all those federal regulations are followed it but the opening salvo .
Let 's not forget the `` maintenance '' costs .
Toll booths , collection machines -LRB- electronic devices for you `` EZ Pass '' sheep are 10 times more costly to maintain -RRB-
And then there is the risk .
The risk being experienced by the Dulles Toll Road folks who have been losing more money than they knew they could lose .
People will avoid your road if it 's toll !
The people who keep harping about `` tolls '' typically have no knowlege of how expensive it is to both run it and maintain it .
The sensible , logical way to fund roads is with a bureaucracy that is already established .
Gas Tax .
However , this all ignores the need for a complete housecleaning at VDOT .
The root cause of why people do n't want to give more money to the state for roads .
One glaring example .
The bogus , made up `` On time - On budget '' figures that VDOT has been parading about .
Were you aware that VDOT does not include projects that are n't `` on time '' or `` over budget '' in that figure ?
The i / Mercury Blvd project that is 77 % over budget and almost 3 - years behind schedule -LRB- by VDOT 's own account -RRB- IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE `` On time - On budget '' figure .
Fix VDOT first , then come back and talk about how you are going to fund our so called `` transportation crisis '' .
The only crisis in transportation we have in Virginia is a loss of trust and confidence in both VDOT and the Legislature .
I 'm with Pat .
Tolls are a lousy idea .
They are a cheap shot way for the legislators to push their fialurs off on the faceless foreign businesses , and they are supported by people who think the tolls wo n't affect them .
If this catches on , we will live to regret the day .
We have tried private tolls before , and they did n't work .
As for trains , forget it unless your goods are travelling 600 miles or so , and happen to be gong in the same direction as the tracks .
The reasosn has less to do with the subsidies enjoyed by highways and truckers than it has to do with speed , reliability , and convenience .

Learning from the Swedes
Reader Rob Jackson calls attention to an article in today 's Wall Street Journal about the experiment in Stockholm , Sweden , with congestion pricing .
It seems that the Swedes , for all their skill in urban planning and their investments in mass transit , are suffering from traffic congestion .
Better yet , they 're adopting a market - driven remedy .
Socialist though they may be , Sweden 's politicians apparently have a firmer grasp of economics than Virginia 's .
The Greater Stockholm region has nearly two million people .
The central city , built upon an archipelago of islands linked by bridges , is particularly prone to congestion .
Under contract with IBM , the national government has set up 23 tolling points which , used in conjunction with transponder boxes , laser detectors and cameras , tracks the path of every car in the city .
Each time a car with a transponder passes through a toll , the charge is automatically deducted from the driver 's bank account .
Tolls vary at different times of the day according to the level of congestion , ranging from the equivalent of $ 1.38 to $ 2.76 per hour .
The goal was to alter motorist behavior -- and that 's exactly what has happened .
Rather than drive to and from work at the same time every day , some Stockholmites -LRB- Stockholmers ? -RRB- are varying their commuting times .
Some are taking different routes .
Some are riding bicycles .
And many are availing themselves of mass transit .
As the WSJ explains : Before the trial began , Stockholm spent about $ 180 million on improvements to public transportation .
It bought about 200 new buses and added rush - hour trains , express bus routes and more park - and - ride lots .
But the changes had little impact on the number of people who left their private cars at home .
In spring 2006 , however , during the trial , use of all forms of public transportation jumped 6 % and ridership on inner - city bus routes rose 9 % , compared with a year earlier .
Now that the six - month trial has ended , the city has scheduled a referendum to let voters decide whether to make the congestion - pricing scheme permanent .
A June poll found that 52 percent of voters favored the plan .
So far , the idea of congestion pricing in Virginia has n't gotten past the talking stage .
Oh yeah -- a system that tracks every car 's movements through transponders will go over with the public in Va .
There remain people who wo n't buy smarttags because they do n't want Big Brother to have the data -LRB- or their spouse 's divorce lawyer . -RRB-
It strikes me as remarkable that our transportation policies are more socialistic than Sweden 's .
We wo n't do photo red , and you are suggesting this ?
Anonymous , I do n't believe that the Swedish system requires people to install transponders .
Some people will prefer that option because it 's more convenient .
Jim : WaPo ran the Wall Street Journal story on D 5 of Business .
Anonymous 11:06 see our comment yesterday re anonymity .
Citizens can have functional transport , functional settlement patterns , functional governance and a sustainable civilization ;
Or they can , to protect cheating husbands and wives and others for whom secrecty is a way to preserve special privilage , obsess over private rights to the exclusion of public responsibilities .
EMR
By all accounts the Stockholm experiment has been a success , so far .
Three issues come to mind .
First , Stockholm spent $ 180 million on transportation improvements before the experiment .
Would the experiment have been as successful if they had not spent the money ?
Was the `` success '' a manufactured result to cover up for the previously failed investment ?
Second , Stockholm had the presence of mind and the fairness of government to put this together as an experiment , and allow the citizens to dismantle it later if they thought it not worthwhile .
That is an admirable approach ,
what US government has ever incorporated a policy as a test and THEN put it up for referendum ?
One of our problems is that having made a mistake , it is impossible to get the government to own up to it .
Where is the referendum on whether we should spend umpteen billion on the Tyson 's project ?
Focus groups and special interests do n't count .
Third , granted , the government in Stockholm has every incentive to spin this in a good light ,
and all the reviews seem good .
I 'm suspicious when no one seems to be able to find any shortcomings .
In London , it took quite some time for the economic effects to sort themselves out and be measured .
Although the London experiment also seems to be a success , there is considerable movement against it and the rapid rise in tolling charges that followed .
It does not seem likely that it will be repeated in other English cities .
For the record , I 'm in favor of congestion tolling , but I also think it will hasten the de-emphasis of central areas .
In London there seems to be a distinct decrease in business just inside the edge of the congestion zone and a distinct increase just outside .
It is too soon to see what happens in Stockholm ,
but the situation in stockholm is a lot different from London .
Singapore is another example of effective use of congestion pricing .
I 'm not usre that there 's much about Singapore 's governmental philosophy that we should emulate -LRB- thinly disguised one - party rule -RRB- but , as someone who has spent a great deal of time there over the past 20 years , I can testify that traffic in the center city is much improved without any indication that economic development has been curtailed .
In Southern California , there are at least two tollways with variable pricing that fluctuates with traffic density .
The highway design is configured to give drivers options about whether to pay the higher rates or get off the road .
Seems to work .
re : congestion pricing and `` edge '' impacts .
simple - move the boundaries ... :--RRB-
further , let 's think outside the box here .
what makes `` congestion pricing '' - WORK ?
It 's electronic tolling .
`` congestion pricing '' is but one of dozens of possible outcomes based on the underlying technology .
The privacy aspects are undeniable but the momentum towards electronic tolling is also .
Right now .. they can `` track '' you with your cell phone and your credit card as well as red - light cameras and even security cameras in businesses .
Electronic Tolling will make possible other methods of collecting revenue from vehicular travel besides congestion pricing .
Obviously new roads / expanded / improved roads will also be possible - roads that we currently have no money for and unlikely to have money for in the near future .
Electronic Tolls present an opportunity to build new roads shortly after the study / decision is made - vice waiting for years .. and in VDOT 's case decades .
The primary difference between this country and other countries ' use of electronic tolling is that we 're still thinking of individual roads whereas those other countries are implementing electronic tolling for the REGION - as a way to SHAPE the entire network 's congestion .
So .. think in terms of the entire NoVa area with a connecting network of electronically tolled roads being priced by the hour ... and the place much like cell phone minutes .
You have to admit - the cell phone business model does two things very , very well .
First , you pay for when / where and do n't get a free ride
and second , the cell companies collect enough in revenues to keep building more cell towers and expand coverage .
think about the same model with roads and electronic tolling .
Larry , the cell phone analogy is brilliant .
That is the logic of where the technology will take us -- if only politics do n't stand in the way .
Either Nova Scout is right or Larry is right .
Congestion pricing does n't seem to have limited Singapore 's economic activity , but how would you know ?
For one thing , it 's like traffic congestion :
the demand is so high that even if you build new roads or throttle the demand , it is still high .
For another , If Larry is right and congestion pricing has shaped the region , then some of that economic activity is not happening where it might have otherwise .
Transportation is very closey connected with economic activity .
So in that sense , what tolling does is impose a tax on profits that have not yet been made .
I think you should tax only income and sales , but I suppose you could rationalize this as a sales tax on use of the roads .
I still think there is no reason to institute tolling except in special circumstances : Expensive bridges , and highly congested zones , for example .
Otherwise a gas tax set high enough to do its job is still a fairer and cheaper method , and more environmentally friendly :
the infrastructure is in place , and it automatically taxes by distance , weight , and horsepower .
The cell phone analogy is far from brilliant .
There are multiple cell phone companies -LRB- Verizon Wireless , Cingular , Sprint , TMobile , etc. -RRB- .
There is only one medieval and corrupt General Assembly .
And their goal was , is and will remain the transfer of wealth from the economically successful -LRB- and congetsed -RRB- areas to those areas of the state locked in the economic practices of the mid 1800s .
This will not end until the Dillon Rule is discarded in Virginia or Northern Virginia forms a separate state .
Congestion `` pricing '' = congestion `` taxation '' .
If you want to continue the cell phone analogy then Maryland ought to have a chance to propose their approach to traffic management using Northern Virginia 's taxes as a competitive alternative to the General Assembly 's proposal .
The people of Northern Virginia -LRB- i.e. the buyers of the product offered under congestion `` pricing '' -RRB- would then have a choice - like they do today with cell phone service .
Until there is choice , this is just another method of perpetuating the Northern Virginia subsidy of the southern Virginia welfare state .
No thanks .
Groveton , You 're missing the point of Larry 's post regarding the cell phone model :
`` First , you pay for when / where and do n't get a free ride
and second , the cell companies collect enough in revenues to keep building more cell towers and expand coverage . ''
How does the presence of absence of competition affect either of those two attributes ?
As for the `` Medieval corrupt '' General Assembly , do n't forget which region of the state sends more senators and delegates to that body than any other .
As we 've discussed elsewhere on this blog , the transfer of wealth between regions is accounted for primarily by the `` Standards of Quality '' funding formula that redistributes resources from affluent school systems to poor school systems , and secondarily by road - funding formulas that favor rural areas .
Your criticisms should be directed to those two particular funding formulas , not to the `` General Assembly '' as a whole .
Northern Virginia 's gripes over these funding formulas could be shared by the affluent suburbs of the Richmond area --
but you do n't hear Richmond suburbanites fantasizing about seceding from the state .
-LRB- For the record : I live in Henrico County . -RRB-
Some Northern Virginians want it both ways .
They 're entirely happy with the arrangement that divests it from any responsibility for the `` inner city '' of e Washington , D.C. , and all those icky poor people ,
and they would like to divest itself from responsibility for outlying rural areas as well .
In other words , these people advocate cherry picking the most affluent suburban jurisdictions of NoVa , creating a separate political entity for themselves and insulating themselves from the urban and rural poor .
A gated community on a regional scale !
Jim , is n't that what congestion pricing does , place a toll gate on the community ?
Ray , congestion pricing uses the pricing mechanism to allocate scarce roadway capacity .
If you want to call that `` placing a toll gate on the community , '' I suppose you can .

`` Thank God I 'm an atheist : ''
The surrealistic cinema of Luis Bunuel --
by Bryan M. Papciak
`` The thought of death has been familiar to me for a long time , '' says Director Luis Bunuel .
`` From the time that skeletons were carried through the streets of Calanda during the Holy Week procession , death has been an integral part of my life .
I 've never wished to forget or deny it ,
but there 's not much to say about it when you 're an atheist '' -LRB- 255 -RRB- .
So reads an accurate testimonial to the personal and artistic sentiment of this odd and serious filmmaker .
Like many of his contemporary surrealists , Bunuel is a paradox who on one hand claims apathy towards ultimate end , being , and Being , yet on the other hand loads his impressive body of work with moribund imagery and strange ideas about the God he so vociferously denies .
Bunuel exhibits a radical , iconoclastic view of the world in which he finds society decadent and antithetical to human liberation .
He has been called a realist , a surrealist , a Marxist , an anarchist , a mystic , an anticleric , a Freudian , a post-Freudian , a sadist , a moralist , a Christian , and a poet - showman of the macabre .
His scenarios range from the absurd to the tragic to the satiric to the erotic , profusely endued with the outrageous and the scandalous .
Luis Bunuel has long been recognized in European critical circles as a great and prolific filmmaker on a par with Eisenstein , Chaplin , and Fellini .
However , only recently has his reputation in America begun to catch up .
Over his fifty - year career he directed thirty - two feature films and worked in Spain , France , Mexico , Italy , and the United States .
Utilizing sardonic humor and the imagery of surrealism , Bunuel set out to undermine the values and institutions people take for granted .
His aims were specific : through the surreal , visualizing the impulses of the uncon - scious , he would , he said , `` shatter the optimism of the bourgeoisie world and force the reader -LRB- or spectator -RRB- to question the permanency of the prevailing order '' -LRB- Mellen 3 -RRB- .
Luis Bunuel was born February 22 , 1900 in Calanda , a small town in the province of Teruel , Spain .
As a youth he received a Jesuit education , displaying exceptional talent in music , athletics , and the natural sciences .
He enjoyed a comfortable upbringing in a reasonably wealthy , close - knit family .
His family came from liberal , semi-intellectual , land - owning bourgeoisie .
These details are not irrelevant .
To comprehend Bunuel 's works it is essential to understand that he was first a Spaniard and secondly a product of Spanish bourgeoisie .
Virginia Higgenbotham points out that `` blasphemy is only a form of thinking for any intelligent Spaniard , '' and also that the `` art of his country is rich in eroticism and profoundly preoccupied with death '' -LRB- 18 , 20 -RRB- .
Bunuel says : My infancy slipped by in an almost medieval atmosphere -LRB- like that of nearly all the Spanish provinces -RRB- between my native town and Zaragova .
I feel it necessary to say here -LRB- since it explains in part the trend of the modest work which I later accomplished -RRB- that the two basic sentiments of my childhood which stayed with me well into adolescence , are those of a profound eroticism , at first sublimated in a great religious faith , and a permanent consciousness of death .
It would take too long here to analyze the reasons .
It suffices that I was not an exception among my compatriots , since this is a very Spanish characteristic , and our art , exponent of the Spanish spirit , was impregnated with these two sentiments .
The last civil war , peculiar and ferocious as no other exposed them clearly .
Coming of age , Bunuel expressed a strong urge to go to Paris to study music but was sent instead to Madrid to study agricultural engineering .
After a few years , he switched his studies to entomology , and , more importantly , began forming close friendships with a group of young artists who were to influence him strongly in the future .
These companions included the poets Frederico Garcia Lorca and Jose Moreno Villa and the painter Salvador Dali .
In the Madrid residencia Bunuel developed his interest in the arts , theater , and acting and gained his introduction to surrealism .
After graduating in 1925 with a degree in Philosophy and Letters , Bunuel moved to Paris , joined by a few members of his residencia coterie .
Bunuel arrived in Paris highly recommended by influential friends of his parents and was introduced into the best intellectual circles of the city .
He was soon hired as an Assistant Director to Jean Epstien , `` the only director of that bleak era of the French cinema to merit the title of an intellectual filmmaker '' -LRB- Aranda 32 -RRB- .
While honing his skills working as an A.D. , Bunuel also began contributing articles to various literary cinema periodicals , most notably La Gaceta Hispanoamericana .
In 1929 he formally entered the Paris Surrealist Group .
Within this setting he embarked on his first film project as director , a collaboration with his residencia friend Salvador Dali , entitled Un Chien Andalou .
He collaborated with Dali again in 1930 on another surrealist film , L_Age d' Or .
The rest , as they say , is history .
Some critics , most notably Pauline Kael and Penelope Gilliatt , now regard Bunuel as the Hitchcock of surrealism -- a venerated master in total command of his medium and for whom the art of filmic manipulation became a `` delightful form of play . ''
For Bunuel , however , play had little to do with it .
Rather , he saw surrealism as a revolutionary , poetic , and moral movement :
All of us were supporters of a certain concept of revolution , and although the surrealists did n't consider themselves terrorists , they were constantly fighting a society they despised .
The principle weapon was not guns , of course , it was scandal .
Scandal was a potent agent of revelation , capable of exposing such social crimes as exploitation of one man by another , colonialist imperialism , religious tyranny -- in sum , all the secret and odious underpinnings of a system that had to be destroyed .
He went on to say , `` The purpose of surrealism was not to create a new literary , artistic , or even philosophical movement , but to explode the social order , to transform life itself ' -LRB- 107 -RRB- .
Salvador Dali recalled the surrealists ' ideology , `` It is possible to systematize confusion thanks to a paranoia and active process of thought and so assist in discrediting completely the world of reality '' -LRB- Gould 37 -RRB- .
Indeed , the intent of surreal art is to move one from the conscious mind into the subconscious .
It seeks to affect the emotions through the mind .
Michael Gould states in Surrealism and the Cinema , `` If the vision revealed is too much for the rational mind to absorb -LRB- too intense , too threatening , too ' real ' -RRB- yet can not be rejected , then it leaves the consciousness and comes to exist on a sublime level as pure surrealism '' -LRB- 13 -RRB- .
In Un Chien Andalou , for example , a girl 's eye is sliced with a razor blade ,
a man wipes his mouth completely off his face ,
dead donkey carcasses adorn a piano ,
a man 's hand crawls with ants .
Each of these images is clearly too intense for rational thought .
Bunuel was drawn to the surrealist movement for more than revolutionary or psychological reasons .
The moral aspects of the movement intrigued him as well :
For the first time in my life , I 'd come into contact with a coherent moral system that , as far as I could tell , had no flaws .
It was an aggressive morality based on the complete rejection of all existing values .
We had other criteria :
we exalted passion , mystification , black humor , the insult , and the call of the abyss .
Inside this new territory , all our thoughts and actions seemed justifiable ;
there was simply no room for doubt .
Everything made sense .
Our morality may have been more demanding and more dangerous than the prevailing order , but it was also stronger , richer , more coherent .
The surreal qualities in Bunuel 's films can be traced to a number of sources ,
but the primary impetus was his `` irrational sensibility '' as evidenced by his treatment of image , montage , and sound .
These gave his films their dreamlike quality .
His most intense images are evocative of either humor or mystery .
Mystery , he believed , is the essential element of any art ;
it is inseparable from chance ,
and the whole universe is a mystery ,
Bunuel believed that his own form of atheism led inevitably to the acceptance of the inexplicable .
`` Since I reject the idea of a divine watchmaker , '' he said , `` -LRB- a notion even more mysterious than the mystery it supposedly explains -RRB- , then I must consent to live in a kind of shadowy confusion ....
At least it keeps my moral freedom intact '' -LRB- 174 -RRB- .
Predictably , adherence to fantasy as opposed to reason in a rationalistic society leads to conflict .
The surrealists opposed nearly all traditional values and , as noted before , sought to destroy `` all conventional social , moral , and artistic habits of thought and perception '' -LRB- Higgenbotham 30 -RRB- .
Enter Un Chien Andalou .
In 1929 , Un Chien Andalou was as shocking and scandalous as Bunuel and Dali had hoped it would be .
It gave rise to a staggering range of interpretations : poetic , scandalous , incoherent , an attack upon critics , an attack upon religion , and attack upon the bourgeoisie .
-LRB- Interestingly , the film was financed by Bunuel 's bourgeois mother . -RRB-
Un Chien Andalou -LRB- which means An Andalusian Dog -- though there are no dogs in the film -RRB- was deliberately intended to jolt the spectator 's peace of mind and to convey some of the basic beliefs underlying the surrealist movement , including the omnipotence of desire .
Bunuel stated that he and Dali held to only one rule during the production ,
`` No idea or image that might lend itself to rational explanation of any kind would be accepted .
We had to open all doors to the irrational and keep only those images that surprised us without trying to explain why '' -LRB- 104 -RRB- .
The aim of the film was not exclusively to shock , but to incendiarially affect the collective conscience .
At the same time it was an indictment of all the art consumers who , either through stupidity , masochism , or self interest , were willing to swallow anything , no matter how much it went against their instincts .
Bunuel asked , `` What can I do about the people who adore all that is new , even when it goes against their deepest convictions , or about the insincere , corrupt press and the inane herd that saw beauty and poetry in something which was basically no more than a desperate call for murder ? '' -LRB- Bauche 9 -RRB- .
The film is a dream and , like a dream , is both fascinating and disturbing .
The opening scene in which a girl 's eye is sliced sets the tone of the film 's meandering and confusing itinerary .
Many of the elements that make up the film are remnants of objective reality .
The way they are arranged within the scenario pushes them into a mental reconstruction process -- in exactly the way dreams draw on the previous day 's experience .
Interestingly , the images have the matter - of - fact quality of a newsreel , or what Higgenbotham calls a `` prosaic realism '' -LRB- 38 -RRB- .
Bunuel chose not to use the distorted lenses , supered images , or blurred focus -LRB- cinematic conventions of the day -RRB- to suggest the dreamlike quality of his film .
Instead , he approached the entire non-narrative in a straightforward manner .
He used the shocking incongruity of the images themselves to build the hallucinatory feeling of anguish that runs through the film .
The unrealistic fashion in which the realistic images were juxtaposed was the perfect way , according to Freddy Bauche , to illustrate `` the dramatic collision between desire and the object of desire '' -LRB- 10 -RRB- .
Obviously , the director drew much of Un Chien Andalou from his Spanish heritage -- the religious and social implications , the themes of emotionalism and death , even the donkey carcasses .
`` Thus Un Chien Andalou , as a milestone in the history of cinema , emerges from its director 's adolescence in Spain and announces the themes and techniques that were to preoccupy Bunuel for half a century , through the rest of his career '' -LRB- Higgenbotham 39 -RRB- .
Where desire and eroticism prevailed in Un Chien Andalou , religion took center stage in Simon del Desierto -LRB- Simon of the Desert -RRB- , produced in Mexico in 1965 .
Simon del Desierto is a bizarre little narrative set in the fifth century A.D.
Saint Simon , in order to be as close to God as possible , has stood praying on top of a sixty - foot pillar for thirty - seven years .
He is profoundly sanctimonious - to the degree that he even blesses his own tooth when it falls from his mouth .
His devotion , however , is put to the test when the Devil -LRB- a woman wearing the uniform of a Catholic school girl -RRB- arrives in a slithering coffin at the pillar .
She is intent on luring the Holy Disciple from his perch as she repeatedly ridicules him and insults his character .
Simon heroically resists her temptations at every turn despite her various disguises ; first , a priest , then a shepherd , and finally as the Savior himself .
At last , despite Simon 's holy strength , and for reasons not entirely clear , the Devil is able to exert her full power and whisk him away to hell -- a Greenwich village disco where trendies writhe and grind to `` The Radioactive Flesh . ''
The implications are staggering .
`` The saint , devoted to his god , sits high on a pillar for all of life ....
But the pillar , discolored over the years , winding and twisting its way to the ground , is the excrement of the saint .
Saint though he is , his bowels must still move .
So there he sits , near God indeed , but supported on a pillar of excrement '' -LRB- Mellen 115 -RRB- .
There have been several interpretations of this seemingly blasphemous imagery .
One is that God and his church are really built on unacknowledged humanity .
Another is that we can reach God only through understanding the true nature of our humanity .
Still another is that religion -LRB- primarily Catholicism -RRB- is essentially a `` pillar of excrement . ''
Bunuel himself put all the interpretations in perspective when he said , `` Thank God I 'm still an atheist . ''
Luis Bunuel 's flair for perverse surrealism and his malicious attacks on conventional morality were fully realized in his second to last film , Le Fantome de la Liberte -LRB- The Phantom of Liberty -RRB- , produced in France in 1974 -- almost fifty years after Un Chien Andalou .
Fantome in many ways functioned as a sort of sequel to his 1972 film , Le Channe Discret de la Bourgeoisie -LRB- The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie -RRB- .
The images are astounding and playfully absurd :
Spanish hostages of the Napoleonic war cry `` Down with Freedom ! '' as they are executed .
A French lieutenant fondles the statue of a beautiful noblewoman and is struck on the head by another statue .
Bourgeois couples discuss defecation around a toilet - lined table but consider `` food '' an impolite topic , and so on .
The titular reference to a `` phantom '' boffows from the opening line of Karl Marx 's Communist Manifesto :
`` A specter is haunting Europe - the specter of communism . ''
Bunuel twists this meaning to imply that the specter haunting the bourgeoisie is `` the possibility of its own freedom unburdened by the dead ends of sexual license , willful irrationality , and the liberty to go beyond the self - indulgent eccentricities of the individual ego '' -LRB- Mellen 318 -RRB- .
Bunuel compared the film to one of his earlier surrealist works , L_Age d' Or , saying , `` It is no longer possible to scandal-ize people as we did in 1930 .
Today you have to do it with sweet subversion '' -LRB- Mellen 183 -RRB- .
Le Fantome de la Liberte charges that society has substituted arbitrary willfulness for freedom .
One of the film 's vignettes shows two parents who insist on declaring their daughter a missing person , although she is plainly sitting in front of them .
The police , in a similar display of willful blindness to reality , even ask the child herself for her vital statistics and how she disappeared .
In another episode , four chain - smoking monks gamble with their holy medallions in a card game .
`` I 'll open with a virgin , '' says one .
Another plays a `` father . ''
Bunuel believed reality is actually a smoke screen for hidden urges .
He used the absurd to imply `` an attack on specific abuses , not on some safely vague condition of man '' -LRB- Durgnat 65 -RRB- .
In Le Fantome de la Liberte Bunuel doubts not so much the possibility for society 's redemption as its likelihood .
`` We have been rendered unwittingly comfortable within our psychic cages to the point where we prefer them to liberty , an experience and aspiration we neither understand or desire '' -LRB- Mellen 331 -RRB- .
For fifty years , Luis Bunuel made films about society 's dilemmas .
His art is his declaration of confidence in a human race dominated by a bourgeoisie given to hypocrisy , sadism , and above all , a disrespect for its own capacity to live differently and better .
He summed it all up himself :
As I drift toward my last sigh , I often imagine a final joke .
I convoke around my deathbed my friends who are confirmed atheists as I am .
Then a priest , whom I have summoned , arrives ;
and to the horror of my friends , I make my confession , ask for absolution for my sins , and receive extreme unction .
After which I turn over on my side and expire .
But will I have the strength to joke at that moment ?
Luis Bunuel died in 1983 .
Not only is Virginia heading for a fiscal crisis , but it may be heading for a constitutional crisis as well .
The Senate and House of Delegates managed to get budget talks back on track last week ,
but negotiations derailed faster than an Amtrak train in a snow storm .
Judging by the exchange of letters released to the public , relations between the Senate and House budget conferees are as acrimonious as they 've ever been .
There are 24 days left to patch together a budget before the fiscal year ends .
Then the state enters a constitutional crisis .
Gov. Timothy M. Kaine says he has the authority to keep basic state services running without a budget .
But Attorney General Robert F. McDonnell says he does not .
-LRB- Read the Washington Post coverage . -RRB-
Meanwhile , senior state lawmakers are due to visit bond rating agencies in New York .
Virginia may be the best managed state in the country when the politicians are actually speaking to one another , but it 's not looking terribly well managed right now .
Only two years ago , on the heels of the last recession , Virginia 's political class was consternated that the state 's AAA bond rating might be cut .
Would n't it be ironic if , despite the 2004 tax increase and a $ 1.5 billion surplus , the rating agencies cut Virginia 's bond rating anyway this year ?
It would appear given the deadlocks and disputes that have afflicted our General Assembly since 2001 , the vaunted Republican majority is just not now nor has it ever been ready for prime time governing .
Anon : ' Ever ' is a bit of hyperbole .
The RINOs are unfit to govern .
That is for sure .
The phony bond crisis of 04 was that Virginia could ' only ' borrow $ 800 m if the Commonwealth wanted to do so .
Why Mr. Atticus Bowden , if `` ever '' were hyperbole perhaps you could tell me when they did manage to govern -- all by themselves , of course ?
The last time they did have a chance was in the 19th Century .
As I recall the Republican and Readjuster movement failed then , too .
The beauty of democracy is that people get the government they deserve .
We in Virginia drank the Kool - aid and elected a bunch of culture warrior idealogues instead of good , pragmatic stewards .
We get what we deserve .
I believe that it would be better to imperil our bond rating than to pass a budget that continues the taxation practices of the past two general assemblies .
I patently reject the idea that the only way out of this morass is to pass a budget that has a net tax increase .
We have to get off this tax and spend merry - go - round .
It 's time we Republicans return to our roots of fiscal conservancy .
Anon : The GOP majority did fine with the Car Tax relief from the 2000 session until the 2002 session when they passed the 2002 Tax Scam .
Also , I was being a bit hopeful that ' ever ' means in the future too .
I agree , that Republicans have n't covered themselves in glory in the GA in the few years our Party has been in the majority .
Getting rid of the old Dem retreads like His Lordship Sir John Chichester , Tommy Norment , etc. will improve the governance .
Yeah .
You 're right in line with Vance Wilkins .
Getting rid of the old Dem retreads like His Lordship Sir John Chichester , Tommy Norment , etc. will improve the governance .
From your lips to God 's ears , Mr. Brown !
Old Dem Retreads I am aware of include Ronald Reagan , Mills Godwin , Lacey Putney ....
BTW down at the funny farm today not only did they make no progress on the new budget , it seems that the agreement on the `` caboose bill '' for the current fiscal year is unraveling .
The Governor made a mistake offering amendments .
It just gave them a new chance to screw it all up again .
Update : Reason prevailed on the `` caboose bill '' and the House backed off a last minute amendment that the Senate would n't go along with , so at least that budget is done .
Otherwise that bill would have ended up back in the conference committee again .
To see this going on in Virginia now is truly an embarrassment .
The Senate gave in on its main point weeks ago and if we reach July 1 with no budget , it is on the House 's head .
Ronald Reagan was a convert , a true believer , who actually believed the same stuff
and the Dems left him .
Virginia has Dem retreads who know the GOP stands for getting elected , but do n't know what the acronym means .
I 'm just trying to fathom the mess we 're going to have if this is n't settled by 7 / 1 .
If we really ca n't pay anyone out of emergency funds , I 'm trying to get my head around what that means -
if I understand it correctly :
no state police on duty
no guards at the state prisons
-LRB- and what are we going to do with the inmates ? -RRB-
no one to handle the patients at the state mental hospitals
no one to handle the patients at the state REGULAR hospitals - MCV , UVA , etc.
What happens to the patients ?
no one working at the state colleges for summer school or research or sending out transcripts and getting ready for the next year -
and no classes at the community colleges
all the state parks closed -
I do n't thnk you can have them open w/o any staff -LRB- trash , safety , etc -RRB-
no unemployment for the furloughed state workers , b/c is n't that handled by state workers ?
most of the folks that give restaurant and well and septic permits furloughed
state courts closed
no one to fix the roads or finish temporary repairs or new construction
a huge mess with figuring out pay and benefits for state workers , who are not going to be happy about this
liquor stores all closed
medical examiners and no state forensic lab specialists all gone home
no one at Consolidated Labs to do rabies checks
no public health people to do the kids ' back to school shots , or epidemiology for homeland security , or the school physicals for sports
no one at the department of vital statistics -
how will we get birth or death certificates ?
state lottery would be closed
the Science Museum in Richmond would be closed
the DMV would be closed
the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts would be closed
VRS retirement checks presumably wo n't go out
and probably a hundred things I have n't thought of .
I 've seen folks say it wo n't be any big deal .
Personally , it sounds like a huge honking mess to me .
After seeing the list of what would not be open and / or on duty ... which I 'm also quite sure is not complete ... I 'll go out on a limb .... and predict ... that this will not happen
and what is really going on is the GA equivalent of two cars speeding towards each other until someone blinks .
I 'll also predict ... that the classic fall - back position for Virginia is the same one used by the Feds -
continue the budget using last budget allocations ... continuing resolution and all that stuff .
On the actual issue of how much tax is enough - I find myself influenced by both sides ' arguments to a certain extent
but I guess what I can not understand is that all things being equal .. does n't population growth result in MORE tax revenues that would be allocated presumedly as they were before - in other words priorities remain the same in terms of allocations ?
If everyone - those already here plus our population growth is to pay HIGHER taxes - should there be an expectation on the part of taxpayers to receive MORE services ... and of course .... what about those that are opposed to the government providing services that private industry could do - for less .
This certainly goes for transportation where we talk about a `` crisis '' that can ONLY be solved by higher taxes and more government spending .
Here 's an interesting article from Pilot Online :
http://home.hamptonroads.com/stories/story.cfm?story=105522&ran=48577
`` The Pocahontas Parkway , a state - owned toll road that opened four years ago on Richmond 's outskirts , has been a financial flop .
With traffic below projections , the nonprofit corporation that operates the road has struggled to avoid defaulting on its bonds .
But salvation has come from an unlikely suitor - an Australian company called Transurban that has agreed to pay the Virginia Department of Transportation $ 522 million in exchange for a 99 - year lease of the road .
That an Australian company has agreed to spend $ 522 million on Pocahontas Parkway , a road that last year collected just $ 10.3 million in tolls .
In exchange for the right to keep all parkway toll revenue , Transurban agreed to build a 1.6 - mile , four - lane road to the Richmond International Airport , pending federal approval .
It also will pay off the parkway 's debt and upgrade its electronic tolling equipment in anticipation of a rate increase expected in 2008 . ''
So ... I 'd ask ... why not replicate this approach to some of our more urgent transportation problems and get VDOT and the State of Virginia out of the business of collecting taxes ... and apparently not knowing how to build even toll roads that will be cost - effective ?
Is this why the GA guys are playing `` chicken '' with the budget ?

Wow ...
talk about hyperbole !
None of what you wrote will happen .
It may not happen -
BUT , if we shut down the Virginia state government , that IS what will happen .
I went to DHRM -LRB- the state human resources dept -RRB- and looked at the open jobs , to see what the state does .
State employees , who will be off duty if the budget is not passed and Kaine does NOT move ahead , would include :
the state police
the staff and faculty of state universities and community colleges
the public health staff of the state and localities of Virginia -LRB- most are state employees even if they are working in your local county - ask if you do n't believe -RRB-
These are the folks that inspect your restaurants , give your kids their back to school shots , give the inspections for well and septic installation , and investigate many dog bites .
the folks at the state department of vital statistics -LRB- birth and death certificates -RRB-
the staff and guards at the state prisons
the nurses , doctors , and other staff at the state teaching hospitals , such as MCV and UVA
the nurses , doctors , and staff at the state mental facilities
the staff at our state parks
the folks who distribute unemployment , disability , and state retirement checks
the judges and employees of our state courts
the folks at VDOT
all the folks at the ABC stores
all the folks at the Virginia lottery
the state and regional medical examiners and the state forensic lab specialists
the staff at the state museums
the folks at the DMV
And if you ca n't pay the state workers , you can not have contractors working either , because that is incurring debt whether you pay them immediately or not .
Go look at DHRM and the state courts system -LRB- separate HR dept -RRB- and see what the state folks do , and who all you 're talking about furloughing .
Then try to tell me that shutting down the state government is n't going to be noticed by the average citizen .
They 'll notice .
And the ones that get really hurt by this , for whatever reason -LRB- see above -RRB- are going to be pretty ticked off .
Not only will it tick off a huge number of state employees and their families , but also the folks on state retirement -LRB- which I believe also includes many folks retired from localities under VRS -RRB- , an awful lot of just regular citizens , and an awful lot of businesses .
This is n't hyperbole .
Look at what the state government actually does .
Shutting the state government down is not an idea that 's going to help get votes in November .
Unless you mean helping get votes for your opponent .

Today , it 's all about diversity -- and quality , of course .
By Christopher Knight -LRB- from LA Times -RRB-
The question was innocent enough .
`` What 's going on with contemporary art these days ? ''
My answer was equally candid .
`` Beats me . ''
I do spend a sizable chunk of my time looking at , reading about and thinking over new art in Los Angeles and elsewhere ,
but the days when a succinct response might quickly sum up the art scene are long gone .
Partly that 's because contemporary art has gone global .
The decade of the 1980s was a pivot , when New York 's postwar role as serious art 's only serious city came to an end .
Mostly , though , it 's because art , wherever it is made , no longer subscribes to a single dominant trend with a few rambunctious alternatives jostling for supremacy .
Art is eclectic --
and today we take that eclecticism for granted .
Look around .
The extreme breadth of artistic diversity is so familiar and so routine as to border on invisibility .
Take the 2006 California Biennial at the Orange County Museum of Art , opening today .
It is typical of most such surveys , which are commonplace in an art scene now sprawling from Berlin to Beijing .
This installment includes Jane Callister 's punchy abstract paintings , which skillfully exploit the capacity of paint to multi-task .
Like a diary , her paint records the artist 's physical process in making the work .
It also has a tendency to run , mix or separate of its own accord , as if an inert material made from pigment bound in acrylic resin had an independent mind and will .
And it possesses a stubborn inclination to represent recognizable things in the world -- especially landscape -- in wholly unexpected , even apocalyptic ways .
But the California Biennial , without seeming the least bit dissonant , can also accommodate art with no relationship whatever to Callister 's inventive reworking of postwar abstraction 's various shibboleths .
There 's the show business shtick of the performance troupe My Barbarian , which turns homemade riffs on TV and Broadway into political entertainment .
Mario Ybarra Jr. once fabricated vato action figure dolls , transforming gang - culture imagery into icons of Duchampian hip - hop .
And the architectural photographs of precarious or ruined buildings by Amir Zaki assert that disintegration and collapse are the inescapable , unseen corollary of the lovely pictures found in our ubiquitous shelter magazines .
Speaking of buildings , for a current show in Pasadena , Carlos Mollura has inserted polyethylene cubes , spheres and other geometric shapes into architectural orifices at a Colorado Boulevard shopping plaza .
As each fat , inflatable form strains against the buildings ' walls and windows with playful , even comic authority , empty space becomes elastic , muscular and apparently ready to burst .
Geometry is ostensibly neutral .
But in the context of this shopping arcade , these geometric forms inescapably imply that hidden powers of urban gentrification are at work .
At Blum & Poe Gallery at the edge of Culver City , meanwhile , a carved lump of luxurious sandstone by Matt Johnson begins with Michelangelo 's Renaissance dictum that sculpture is a spiritually inclined process of chipping away stone to liberate a natural life force already locked inside .
Johnson put his chisel to work ,
but he uncovered something quite different .
A bleary death 's head lurked within .
Moreover , the skull 's distended features recall a famous 1943 bronze memento mori by Picasso , who revolutionized sculpture for the 20th century .
Johnson , metaphorically killing off two artistic titans in one deceptively simple gesture , achieves quite a sculptural feat .
Katie Grinnan 's sculpture at ACME follows an entirely different track .
Her `` Rubble Division '' mixes such disparate materials as ink - jet prints pasted on board , foam rubber , galvanized steel , concrete , steel rebar and bungee cords .
Folding and unfolding pictures of ruined buildings with pictures of vernacular modern architecture , she articulates a disorienting collision between the material world and virtual reality .
The sculpture -- tall and gangly , with angular flaps held precariously in place by tension cords -- looks like a cross between a communications satellite and a homeless shelter scavenged from a freeway underpass .
What 's going on with contemporary art these days ?
Clearly a lot .
Yet Callister , My Barbarian , Ybarra and Zaki comfortably cohabit in a single group show .
Mollura , Johnson and Grinnan are all first - rate sculptors ,
and none makes sculpture that even remotely recalls the others .
Their disparate works cover the waterfront .
Many of these artists do evoke a world coming apart at the seams .
-LRB- Given current events , how could they not ? -RRB-
But the stresses and strains of contemporary life register in heterogeneous ways .
And their extreme eclecticism is not exclusive to California .
It 's the norm everywhere today .
' Pluralism ' does n't do it justice
I use the word `` eclectic '' rather than `` pluralist '' for a reason .
Eclecticism is a virtue because not only does it draw from a variety of sources and promote divergent positions , it also makes an argument about what is best among the various doctrines , methods or styles it employs .
Eclecticism is elitist in the finest sense of that widely misused word , which has nothing to do with old - fashioned notions of exclusive aristocratic taste and everything to do with embracing diversity while also demanding quality .
In the 1980s some critics advanced pluralism as art 's natural condition .
They were partly right .
The idea that two or more kinds of ultimate artistic reality could comfortably coexist has n't always been in vogue .
Twentieth century art was long charted as an almost linear succession of `` isms '' -- from Fauvism in 1905 to Abstract Expressionism in the 1950s -- discrete movements that each expressed its own unitary view of things .
The monolithic view that had congealed by the 1960s was a belief that the eye held dominion over art .
That limited judgment was toppled by Conceptualism , which devalued everything visual in art and instead polished up the stature of ideas .
`` The idea becomes the machine that makes the art , '' Sol LeWitt famously wrote in 1967 to explain Conceptual art .
And the idea could range far and wide , encompassing virtually any subject , attitude or experience one might imagine .
Looking back from today 's art world , though , a slightly different history of eclectic art suggests itself .
Conceptual art does n't mark the decisive break , just the elaboration and consolidation of an idea already in play .
Pop art marks the most profound rupture .
The landmark exhibition of Robert Rauschenberg 's 1950s hybrids of painting and sculpture that closed recently at the Museum of Contemporary Art convinced me of that .
Rauschenberg , together with Jasper Johns , set the stage for Pop .
Their work undermined art 's established structure .
Pop art tipped it over .
With its commercial subject matter , pitch - perfect sense of style , wicked humor , easy sociability and serious refusal to take art too seriously , Pop made hash of the rigid hierarchy of high art -LRB- painting , sculpture , drawing -RRB- and low art -LRB- TV , tabloids , photographs -RRB- .
An entrenched legacy of an aristocratic worldview , this hierarchy of high and low was traded in for a more fluid , porous pecking order .
The early - '60s work of Andy Warhol , Edward Ruscha and Roy Lichtenstein is as brainy as the existential subjects of the Abstract Expressionist artists that preceded them ,
and it is also as dumb as the Sunday funnies are .
That 's about as eclectic as a work of art can be .
One place the breadth and scope of the contemporary art scene is creating increasing pressures is in museums .
Few were engaged with contemporary art 30 years ago ,
but many have waded in , desirous of the energy and public interest that come with the territory .
Few , however , are equipped to handle the lively situation since it contradicts the orderly traditions of institutional structure .
Nowhere has the problem been more keenly felt than in New York , center of not just the art market and art media but traditional museum culture .
Contemporary programming at the Guggenheim , the Metropolitan , the Modern and Whitney can most charitably be described as a train wreck .
So , what 's going on with contemporary art these days ?
It 's a post-Pop world , `` ism '' - free and with no end in sight .
Pop culture used to be synonymous with mass culture ,
but in the era of 500 cable channels , iPods and the Internet , broadcasting has faltered and been joined by vibrant narrowcasting .
Contemporary art 's avid audience now approaches in size the ratings for HBO 's latest hit .
America 's political battles of the past 20 years may center on attempts to repeal or defend the dramatic changes wrought during the 1960s , but our robust artistic bounty today is its resplendent legacy .

Tomgram : Roger Morris on The Rumsfeld Legacy
By Tom Engelhardt
Created Feb 17 2007 - 11:39am
Here 's a classic Rumsfeldism -LSB- 1 -RSB- :
`` We do have a saying in America :
if you 're in a hole , stop digging ...
erm , I 'm not sure I should have said that . ''
In Part 2 of his historical excavation of the life and world of Donald Rumsfeld -LRB- not to speak of the worlds of both President Bushes , the neocons , the U.S. military , the GOP , and an indolent media -RRB- , Roger Morris , already deep in that hole , just keeps digging away .
In doing so , he offers us the rest of Rumsfeld 's long march to power , his lasting legacies , and the costly lessons of this comeback kid .
So much that went unheeded in the years in which Rumsfeld once again scaled the heights of power is now , thanks to Morris , compactly on the record .
`` The absence of evidence is not necessarily the evidence of absence '' is another infamous Rumsfeldism .
How true .
And in Rumsfeld 's absence , the evidence of how he changed our world for the worse will be with us to consider for years to come .
So , if you missed it , check out `` Sharp Elbows , '' -LSB- 2 -RSB- the first part of `` The Undertaker 's Tally , '' and then settle in for the sequel , the one you thought you knew until you read `` The Power and the Glory . ''
Read it and remember , the bell tolls for thee .

The Power and the Glory : The Undertaker 's Tally -LRB- Part 2 -RRB-
By Roger Morris
In 1976 , when Jimmy Carter took the Presidency from Gerald Ford , outgoing Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld went off to seek corporate wealth as head of G.D. Searle , a Skokie pharmaceutical company .
His period running the business , inherited by the family of his North Shore friend and early backer Dan Searle , would become part of Rumsfeld 's legend of success as a master manager , negligently accepted as fact by the media and Congressional representatives at his 2001 confirmation hearings .
The legend went this way :
Political prodigy slashes payroll 60 % , turns decrepit loser into mega-profit - maker , earns industry kudos and multiple millions .
In looking at men of prominence like Rumsfeld who revolve in and out of the private sector , the Washington media almost invariably adopts the press - release or booster business - page version of events from what inside - the - Beltway types call `` the real world . ''
In Rumsfeld 's case , behind the image of corporate savior lay a far more relevant and ominous history .
In the documented version of reality , derived from litigation and relatively obscure investigations in the U.S. and abroad , Searle turned out to enjoy its notable rise less thanks to Rumsfeldian innovative managerial genius than to old - fashioned reckless marketing of pharmaceuticals already on the shelf and the calling in of lobbying `` markers '' via its well - connected Republican CEO .
And over it all wafted the distinctive odor of corrupt practices .
A case in point was Searle 's anti-diarrhea medicine Lomotil , sold ever more widely and profitably internationally -LRB- in industry terms `` dumped '' -RRB- -- especially in Africa in the late 1970s -- despite the company 's failure to warn of its potentially dire effects on younger children .
`` A blindly harmful stopcock , '' one medical journal called the remedy , which could be poisonous to infants only slightly above Searle 's recommended dosage .
Even taken according to directions , Lomotil was known to mask dangerous dehydration and cause a lethal build - up of fluids internally .
Having advertised the medicine as `` ideal for every situation , '' Searle did not undertake a cautionary labeling change until the end of 1981 , nearly five years into Rumsfeld 's tenure , and then only when threatened with damaging publicity by children 's advocacy groups .
Part of the vast outrage of multinational `` pharmas '' exploiting the Third World , the company under Rumsfeld would , like the more publicized Upjohn with its Depo - Provera , be implicated in widespread bribery of officials -LRB- and others -RRB- in poorer countries to promote the sale of oral contraceptives which had been found unsafe for American or European women .
But Searle 's magic potion , concocted well before Rumsfeld 's arrival , was to be the controversial artificial sweetener aspertame , marketed under the trade name NutraSweet .
By 1977 , the Food and Drug Administration -LRB- FDA -RRB- had staunchly refused to approve aspertame for some 16 years , finding test data dubious or inconclusive and fearing that potential long - term dangers might prove prohibitive .
As Rumsfeld took over in Skokie , the FDA was taking the rare step of recommending to Justice Department prosecutors that a grand jury investigate the company 's applications for FDA approval for `` willful and knowing failure to make reports . concealing material facts and making false statements '' in connection with the statutory application process required by law and FDA standards .
Over the next four years , federal regulators held firm against Searle 's heavily financed campaigns .
Only with Reagan 's election in 1980 did fix and favor supplant science and the public interest .
Having campaigned for the new president and been named to his transition team , Rumsfeld told his Searle sales force , according to later testimony , that `` he would call in all his markers and that no matter what , he would see to it that aspartame would be approved . ''
The sequel would be a classic of the genre :
Searle 's reapplication to the FDA the day Reagan was inaugurated ; the prompt appointment of an agreeable FDA commissioner who would later go to work for Searle 's public relations firm for $ 1,000 a day ; further questionable , company - commissioned tests with more doubts by FDA scientists but approval of aspertame nonetheless ; a later plague of health problems but by then vast profits throughout the corporate food economy followed by lavish , multi-company contributions to Congressional committee members to stifle any outcry ; eventually , a $ 350 million class - action suit alleging racketeering , fraud , and multiple abuses centering on Rumsfeld , who meanwhile had become gloriously rich from aspertame and the $ 2.7 - billion sale of Searle to Monsanto in 1985 .
In his return to the Pentagon in 2001 , he would go duly unscathed by any of the company 's history .
By the time litigation would be filed , the United States was already 18 months into the occupation of Iraq .
Envoy
As it was , despite his business conquests , Rumsfeld missed an even greater prize .
He had been on a short list to become Ronald Reagan 's running mate in the 1980 presidential campaign when the candidate unexpectedly reached for his defeated primary rival -LRB- and Rumsfeld nemesis -RRB- George H.W. Bush .
While , over the next 12 years , Bush went on to the vice - presidency and presidency , and Jim Baker -- equally detested by Rumsfeld -- went along with his patron to White House staff and cabinet power , Rumsfeld would build his Searle fortune and bide his time .
The one exception to his involuntary Reagan - era exile from government would be a stint in 1983 as special presidential envoy to the Middle East .
He would be sent to arrange U.S. support for Saddam Hussein 's Iraq in its war with the hated Iranians of Ayatollah Khomeini , a role little noticed at the time which nonetheless produced the notorious photo of Rumsfeld shaking hands with the Iraqi dictator .
The deeper story was far more embarrassing than any simple handshake .
Most of the relevant records on Rumsfeld 's several - month assignment are still classified , though it is clear that , as at the Office of Equal Opportunity -LRB- OEO -RRB- , he took on his mission with a passion .
He worked to shower on Saddam -LRB- in a manner as unnoticed as possible -RRB- an infamous flow of intelligence , financial credits , and sensitive materials and technology that would come to underpin Iraqi chemical and bacteriological warfare programs , leading to hideous gas attacks on Shia dissidents and Kurds as well as the Iranian forces .
In general , Rumsfeld put his shoulder to the wheel to shore up the war - worn Baathist regime that had attacked Iran in 1980 .
In this mid-1980s de facto alliance with Saddam , as in much else , Rumsfeld was never alone .
Their gambit was , in turn , backed by Senators and Congressmen in both parties who were briefed on Rumsfeld 's mission and obligingly shunned oversight of the manifold aspects of the sometimes illegal collusion with the Iraqis .
Their dereliction was assured , in part , by the general animus toward Iran on a Capitol Hill then effectively controlled by the Republicans , and increasingly under the bipartisan influence of the growing Israeli lobby and its Tel Aviv handlers .
The lobby quietly , cynically pushed both for Reagan administration aid to Iraq and for covert arms - dealing with Iran -LRB- later exposed in the Iran - Contra scandal -RRB- , viewing the ongoing no - winners carnage of two Islamic states as a boon .
All this went on largely unreported , given the customary media diffidence or indolence on national security issues .
Historically , the moral outrage and far - reaching political folly of Washington 's furtive arming of one tyranny to bleed another , with untold casualties on each side -LRB- including the murderous suppression of would - be democrats in both countries -RRB- , would belong at the doorstep of Reagan 's reactionary regime and the Washington foreign - policy establishment as a whole .
Rumsfeld 's role was instrumental and in some respects crucial , but only part of the larger disgrace .
At the same time , in the intelligence briefings he received as the first ranking U.S. official to go to Iraq since the Baghdad Pact of the 1950s , he would have been uniquely aware , as no other senior figure in Washington , of the brutal character of Saddam Hussein 's regime and , in particular , the sectarian , regional , tribal , and clan politics that lay behind it .
The Ba'athists were a government , after all , that the CIA itself had helped to recruit and install in the coup of 1963 , reinstalled in 1968 when the Agency 's original clients lost control , and then watched closely while Baghdad had a flirtation -LRB- involving an arms - supply relationship -RRB- with the feared Russians -LRB- whose influence the bloody 1963 coup was supposed to counter -RRB- .
This was particularly true in the aftermath of the Arab - Israeli War of 1973 with its peace agreements from which Iraq emerged as a principal remaining challenge to Israel .
By 1983 , the volatile , complex currents of Iraq 's political culture , Saddam 's essentially family and clan rule , and the now crude , now subtle layering of Sunni and Shia in the Ba'athist bureaucracy and plutocracy , as well as the wartime distrust and savage repression of a suspect , subordinate Shia majority , were well known to outside intelligence agencies as well as scholars and journalists .
The CIA , DIA and State Department Bureaus of Near Eastern Affairs and Intelligence and Research -- and certainly Rumsfeld as presidential envoy -- also had reason to understand much about Saddam 's grandiose ambition , in Iraq 's old rivalry with Egypt , to lead a pan-Arab nationalist renaissance to some kind of future parity with Israel 's nuclear - armed military might .
In addition to the usual extensive intelligence - sharing with Israel 's Mossad , less than two years before Rumsfeld 's Iraq mission CIA operatives had literally lit the way for Israeli F fighter bombers in their June 1981 surprise attack on Saddam 's fledgling nuclear reactor at Osiraq .
They planted guidance transmitters along the low - level flight path under Jordanian and Iraqi radar to the point of painting the target with lasers .
The Agency and Mossad then watched as the Iraqis dauntlessly , defiantly began to rebuild and expand their nuclear program .
From some 400 scientists and technicians with $ 400 million in funding , that program would grow to perhaps 7,000 scientists and technicians with as much as $ 10 billion at their command , some of which was indirectly made possible by the bounty Rumsfeld carried to Baghdad in the mid-1980s
For anyone dealing seriously with these issues , there could have been little doubt that Saddam would use the considerable aid and trade Rumsfeld was sliding his way under the table to mount a better - armed , more bloody war on Iran , to further the regime 's most ambitious dreams of weapons development , and to tyrannize all the more savagely potentially rebellious Iraqi Shiites and Kurds .
As Washington watched , he did all of that --
and no one could have been less surprised than Rumsfeld himself .
Long afterward , as some of the ugly essence of his mission to Baghdad dribbled out amid the ruins of Bush 's Iraqi occupation , Rumsfeld would be faulted for pandering to , and appeasing , Saddam -LRB- whose gassing of the Kurds had already begun -RRB- -- in the wake of a single , timorous , hypocritical statement issued in Washington in March 1984 criticizing his use of chemical weapons .
The actual toll of the policy to which he was integral would prove so much higher as time passed .
Iraqi chemical weapons plants bombed in the 1991 Gulf War released agents to which some 100,000 American troops were exposed .
The infamous Gulf War Syndrome might evend be traced in some measure to the U.S. credits , materiel , and technology Rumsfeld knowingly conveyed seven years before .
So , too , of course , could Saddam 's brutal 1980s repression of the Shia , underlying the sectarian animus and resolve for vengeance and dominance by the U.S. - installed Shia regime after 2003 that shaped Rumsfeld 's , and America 's , historic failure in Iraq .
Others colluded at every turn in the long scandal of policy toward Iraq .
Colin Powell , then the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs , and Dick Cheney , as Secretary of Defense during the First Gulf War , would , for instance , be directly complicit in the Syndrome outrage .
Yet none of the participants in the larger post / 11 disaster was more directly responsible than Rumsfeld .
While Reagan 's special envoy was , with his usual energy and sharp elbows , dickering with the Iraqis in the mid-1980s , Condoleezza Rice was an assistant professor of no scholarly distinction at Stanford ; Cheney a third - term congressman from Wyoming squirming up the House leadership ladder ; future viceroy of Baghdad L. Paul `` Jerry '' Bremer moving from State Department clerk and Alexander Haig protege to lavish - party giving ambassador to the Netherlands ; and George W. Bush , still by his own account given to `` heavy drinking , '' absorbed in changing the name of his chronically failed Arbusto Energy oil company to Bush Exploration .
Waiting Game
By 1987 , Rumsfeld was flexing his muscles once more , preparing for the ultimate goal , assembling money and party support for a presidential run against George H. W. Bush in 1988 .
But after a dozen years out of office , and against the entrenched power of an heir apparent , he would soon enough discover that backing just was not there .
Off more recent prominence and with a wider political base , Cheney would try to mount his own presidential campaign in the early 1990s , only to meet the same bitter rejection
Historians will only guess at the rancor building in these two deeply ambitious , deeply disappointed figures at the president they had , George W. Bush , whom they no doubt saw as manifestly , maddeningly inferior .
The Rumsfeld - Cheney recompense , at vast cost to the nation and world , would be their fierce seizure of power after September 11 , 2001 .
Rumsfeld spent the 1990s again in business , becoming CEO of General Instruments , then Chairman of Gilead Sciences Pharmaceuticals , with another history reminiscent of Searle .
In 1990 , he joined the board of ABB , a Swedish - Swiss conglomerate that had gobbled up companies in the latter 1980s , including Westinghouse energy operations , and would move aggressively to win a $ 200 - million contract for `` the design and key components '' for light - water nuclear reactors in North Korea .
Rumsfeld pursued this prize even while chairing a Congressional commission on missile threats that found a `` clear danger '' for the future from Pyongyang .
In the alarming report , his otherwise fulsome resume failed to mention that he was an ABB director .
In 1996 , he took leave from Gilead to become chief foreign policy advisor , along with Wolfowitz , in Robert Dole 's failed presidential run .
He would end as the campaign 's eighteen - hour - a - day manager .
By 1997 , amid the full - scale takeover of the Washington GOP by the long - churning cabal of neoconservatives , he joined Cheney and Wolfowitz on a Newt Gingirch - instigated Congressional Policy Advisory Board to shape attacks on the second Clinton Administration .
In January 1998 , he signed the celebrated letter so publicly sent to Clinton from the right - wing , Israeli lobby - dominated Project for a New American Century .
Alongside Wolfowitz , Perle , and others soon to be key players in the younger Bush 's regime , he vigorously urged the `` removal '' of Saddam .
In July 1998 , there followed the `` Rumsfeld Commission '' report on missile threats , wildly claiming , in an unnamed debut of the `` axis of evil '' drawn from the testimony and staff work of right - wing ideologues , that Iran , Iraq , and North Korea would each be able to `` inflict major destruction '' on the U.S. by 2002 .
Through it all , including the first seven - and - a - half months of their rule after the seamy election of 2000 , there would be no trace of the actual danger that erupted out of a September morning sky in 2001 .
Though he had repaired surface relations with the Bushes , Rumsfeld took no major role in the 2000 race .
In any case , the elder Bush had erased him from his son 's list of possible running mates , while ultimately waving through Cheney , whose reactionary animus had been relatively well masked at the Pentagon in 1989 .
When , post-election , Cheney vetoed Governor Tom Ridge for the Pentagon , and there were throbbing neocon fears that a cosmetic Powell , bureaucrat at heart , would be far too equivocal at the State Department , Rumsfeld would be Cheney 's , and so Bush 's , antidote .
His appointment was a mark of the extreme poverty of Republican talent the administration reflected so graphically .
The supposed party of national security , having held the White House for five of the last eight terms and dominated Congress for much of the previous 30 years , had no serious alternative to a man who had perched atop the Pentagon a full quarter - century before .
Apart from the patently right - wing , widely discredited missile panel he had chaired , Rumsfeld had shown no palpable interest or competence in the ever more complex defense issues accumulating since then , much less the rapidly changing politics of the post-Cold War world . Nonetheless , fit , relatively youthful at 69 , he strode again into the E-Ring .
There was speculation that the old Halloween Massacre goal was still there , that Cheney , with his uncertain health , might step aside in 2004 , that the undertaker might yet reach the Oval Office .
Mastery
Rumsfeld began his Pentagon reprise by seizing on a dead Russian marshal and an octogenarian Washington bureaucrat few had ever heard of .
Like Osama bin Laden , steely - haired Nikolai Ogarkov first came to light during the Soviet war in Afghanistan .
In 1977 , at 50 , he had become a prodigal chief of the Soviet General Staff .
In that superannuated , medal - mummified company , he proved a dynamic , technically inclined , forward - thinking young general .
Over the ensuing years , he would be an impressive Moscow spokesman on arms control , and defend stubbornly , even abjectly , the 1983 shooting down of a civilian Korean Airlines 747 that had veered into Soviet air space .
Ogarkov would fall from power in a 1984 Kremlin struggle over weapons spending , write a valedictory book warning of American militarism , and die in post-Soviet obscurity in 1994 .
But his main , if esoteric , historical distinction would lie in a slight 1982 pamphlet in which he blamed the early , nearly lethal Russian defeats in World War II on a failure to adapt to the new German blitzkrieg concepts in tank warfare .
Recent U.S. advances in weapons technology , he argued , could leave the Russians similarly vulnerable if they did n't adapt quickly enough .
Sweeping changes in tactics and arms as well as more agile , responsive armed forces were needed to face the American challenge , the Marshal advised .
Otherwise , Soviet forces would fall into a series of devastating traps on a future remote - targeted battlefield in which the enemy would utilize the latest computerized surveillance and information systems in a new form of high - tech warfare .
His vision soon gained vogue as much in Washington as amid the stultified upper reaches of the Soviet military of the early 1980s .
It was grandly christened -- and welcomed by Pentagon aficionados -- as the `` Revolution in Military Affairs '' or , in that acronym - laden world , RMA .
There was a certain banality to Ogarkov 's stress on technology .
That a fighting force should be best attuned to the battlefield and adversary of the moment -- modern , adaptable , quick , and informed -- should have been self - evident , on the order of the bloody lesson 80 years before of the Tsarist cavalry charging entrenched machine guns in the Russo - Japanese War .
Yet however obvious the premise , the RMA concept -- transported to the Pentagon and put in the context of an onrushing generation of electronic warfare , of near - nuclear effects with non-nuclear means , along with Ogarkov 's call for fresh tactics -LRB- and thus new weaponry and higher spending -RRB- -- was taken up by innovators , opportunists , and their assorted hybrids on both sides of the Cold War .
This was particularly so among the Soviets , whose rusty Europe - heavy military was already being shaken and bled in Afghanistan by the Mujahideen -- in 1982 , despite ample Saudi money , still only partially armed by their cynical CIA , Pakistani , and Chinese handlers .
At any rate , Ogarkov 's truism was also grist for the Pentagon 's back - ring band of civilian military `` theorists , '' career bureaucrats ever in search of a mission and occupationally disposed to attribute evil genius -- requiring a suitable Washington budgetary response -- to the Red Menace .
Short , bald , and with stylishly severe wire - rimmed glasses , Andrew Marshall was a Dickensian clerk of a man who took up the bureaucratic cudgel RMA represented and brought it down inside the Pentagon .
An economist by training , he had begun at RAND as an analyst in the late 1940s , when Rumsfeld was still in New Trier High School .
Marshall was archetypical in the career - making fear and folly of the U.S. - Russian mirror - image rivalry .
He had been a protege of think - the - unthinkable , World War III theorist Herman Kahn , and then , via Henry Kissinger 's mentor Fritz Kraemer , had gone to work for Kissinger at the National Security Council -LRB- NSC -RRB- in the first Nixon term .
In 1973 , he moved on to the Pentagon where he presided over his own obscure nest , the Office of Net Assessment , from Rumsfeld I to II , while gradually gaining the reputation of resident genius of new war methods .
Discreet guru to reactionaries , ignored but thought untouchable by Democrats when in power , Marshall looked on as the Joint Chiefs not only spied on Kissinger 's arms control negotiations with the Russians , but also played an ardent supporting role in Nixon 's fall .
He subsequently signed on to Rumsfeld I 's denial of defeat in Vietnam and then , on RMA 's advent , used the concept to evoke ominous fears of a new Kremlin military prowess , justifying the orgy of Pentagon spending that took place during the Reagan era .
-LRB- Ironically , of course , Ogarkov in 1982 was arguing for a Russian response to a still largely prospective American escalation of weaponry and warfare . -RRB-
While the U.S. armaments spree of the 1980s paid for some new RMA developments , most of the expenditures fit snugly within the corrupt , obtuse old Cold War system , with America 's armed forces tailored to a lumbering Soviet threat in Europe , and no serious anticipation of the neo-insurgency wars that actually lay ahead .
As Marshall toyed with `` flexibility '' -- and the Joint Chiefs cherry - picked his conjuring of Moscow 's might for their own budgetary purposes , while ignoring the real import , and limits , of RMA -- the Cold War ended in the equivocations and evasions of Bill Clinton 's two terms in office and the low - rent , self - congratulatory installing of mafia regimes in Bosnia and Kosovo .
The gnome - like Marshall , well past retirement but a lionized witness before the missile - threat commission , hung on for Rumsfeld 's return .
The resulting history is far too close for much documented detail , though its silhouette is plain enough .
Summoning Marshall as soothsayer , Rumsfeld made RMA the logo of his determination to gain managerial dominance over the Joint Chiefs and the Pentagon bureaucracy , exactly the opportunity he thought he had missed 25 years earlier .
Under the old banner of a clash between a brave , beleaguered secretary of defense and the recalcitrant brass astride an impossible , `` glandular '' system , he held up the all - purpose , all - seasons ideal of Pentagon `` reform . ''
That `` reform '' movement was to be his ultimate takedown , his claim to greatness , and perhaps -- who knew in 2001 -- one last shot at the presidency .
Amid the inevitable claims of `` streamlining '' and `` modernizing , '' Democrats applauded and reporters gushed reflexively about Rumsfeld as a celebrity CEO and national quipster .
The willing ignorance , denial , careless trust , or craven acquiescence that marked the essential submissiveness of the political and media culture to Rumsfeld 's rule were only part of a larger , thoughtless national abdication of judgment and responsibility in the wars he would propel in both Afghanistan and Iraq .
In blindly striking out after 9 / 11 -- a reflexive , grandly opportunistic , richly self - satisfying political act in America -- without seriously understanding the politics or history of either country , he plunged the Pentagon into blundering , plundering occupations that made the nightmares of 2007 and beyond nearly inevitable .
That was the price -- in the utter absence of serious dialogue in the 2000 election or the first eight months of 2001 -- of the original uncontested surrender of foreign - policy power and initiative to such evident presidential incompetence -LRB- including the shocking ineptitude of NSC Advisor Condoleezza Rice and her staff -RRB- and the long predictable Rumsfeld - Cheney dominance .
All of it was plain in Washington soon after George W. Bush 's arrival in the Oval Office ; none of it was then questioned , much less challenged , by Congress , the remnant foreign policy establishment , or the mainstream media .
No democratic process so completely failed a test of substance as America 's after 9 / 11 .
No ensuing catastrophe was more consensual .
History will unravel only slowly Rumsfeld 's relationship to the neocons , who dominated the middle and upper reaches of his Pentagon , a relationship more complex than contemporary hagiographies or demonologies have had it .
Historically , he was their ally , patron , legitimizing figurehead , but never really of them , never a fellow ideologue , dogmatist , or slavish adherent to much of what they pursued .
In enlisting Wolfowitz , Perle and their train , he would use them , much as he used Marshall , as he had used so many before , as a means to what was so largely a personal , megalomaniacal end .
But that use , too , was characteristically heedless of substance and cost .
He opened government as never before to men who habitually , automatically assumed that U.S. and Israeli interests were identical , with no objectivity about American policy in a Middle East they scarcely understood to begin with .
Their ignorance and presumption were matched only by their zeal to cluster in decisive quarters of the new Bush regime where decisions of grand strategy , of war and peace , were now shaped and predetermined .
`` Like cancer cells , '' as eyewitness , Lieutenant Colonel Karen Kwiakowski , would describe them in action in Rumsfeld 's Defense Department .
Half - educated and fanatically loyal to the rote Israeli lobby view of the Middle East and the larger neocon craze for American post-Cold War global hegemony , they crowded the domains of the number three official at the Pentagon , Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith , whose career was a model of their kind and whose notorious Office of Special Plans was created as a fount for the fraudulent intelligence spurring the invasion of Iraq .
Historians will debate , too , the obvious blurred allegiance of what some call these American `` Likudniks '' with their utter conformity to the belligerent ultra-Zionist mentality of the Israeli right .
Never before -- not even in the post-World War II heyday of the powerful China Lobby with its formidable grip on Capitol Hill but not within the upper reaches of the Executive itself -- had so many of such uncritical adherence to the policies of a foreign power been so well placed in Washington .
As often in American politics and government , however , no conspiracies were necessary , though a Pentagon - Israeli lobby spy scandal has yet to be played out .
Unrelieved substantive shallowness , a perversely narrow sociology of knowledge , long - jockeyed - for power and career advancement , a grandiose parochial vision of a Pax Americana world nursed in a hundred forgotten think - tank papers and incestuous conferences -- all that as well imposed a stifling , disastrous orthodoxy on the administration .
Not least , they operated without the need to support their prejudices or delusions in authentic high - level debate , flourishing in their members - only domains of the Pentagon , the NSC Staff , and the State Department , enjoying exclusive channels of communication to the White House controlled by Cheney , and unchallenged under a President of uniquely closed mind .
As for Rumsfeld 's relations with his generals , the subject of veiled accusations of his heedlessness to dissent or running roughshod over warnings of serious problems , we actually know very little .
The calamity in Iraq has brought more public criticism by senior officers than any other war in American history , including Vietnam , but almost all of it hurled from the relatively safe seats of two - and three-star retirement -- and forlornly after the fact .
This much is clear :
No major Pentagon leaks , the time - honored Washington weapon of dissenting commanders , marked the run - up to the invasion .
There have been no public resignations in protest of his policies .
And the negligence , incompetence , and inertia of commanders in recognizing and coping with the insurgency , in dealing with scandals of prisoner abuse , inadequate equipment and more , have been all too obvious .
There is no evidence that any ranking American officer on duty pressed an intellectual or moral challenge to the unfolding debacle -- even after it was too glaring to be ignored .
As in so much else in his long record , Rumsfeld enjoyed , by Washington 's inimitable mix of careerism and cowardice , submission and opportunism , a large supporting cast in his folly .
Takedown
In the exhilarating dash to Baghdad in 2003 , none of the admiring gallery seemed to notice that Rumsfeld 's `` new '' military was largely the old one , `` reformed '' in name only ; nor did many note that the vaunted lean , mean machine of RMA and the again - lionized Marshall had no grasp of how profoundly political was the act of overthrowing 40 years of Ba rule ; how deeply political was the campaign to which so many American lives , so much of the country 's material and symbolic national treasures , would be committed .
Rumsfeld would take his victory tour in the Gulf that spring as if circling the mat after a stunningly swift pin .
What was his toughest call , trailing reporters asked -- part of the traditional garlands of victory tossed his way -- and how did he `` feel '' at such a victorious moment ?
It was hardly the time for the media , the seemingly omnipotent military , or the rest of government and the political culture to reflect on how much `` shock and awe '' depended on overwhelming force brought down on the near - defenseless , on how much the concept reeked of racism and colonial pretense - of natives on the scene and in the vicinity `` shocked and awed '' like Zulus pounded and panicked by the Queen 's own latest howitzers .
It was far too early for other questions -- about a force cosseted at the end of vulnerable supply lines , nicely photogenic in night goggles but without enough body armor ; about acronyms like IED that had yet to enter the vocabularies of either commanders or reporters ; about the familiar chase for medals and the absence of an enemy admitting defeat and ready to surrender -LRB- a missing essential of `` victory '' that would have much worried Maxwell Taylor -RRB- .
Unreformed , uninformed commanders , uninstructed beyond brief battles , led their charges into Iraq relying on their generals .
The generals relied on civilians .
The civilians relied on -LRB- or were seduced or bullied by -RRB- the neocons .
The neocons relied on their own ersatz expertise , Mossad insiders , and Iraqi exiles long out of touch with their homeland .
The exiles -- holed up in Baghdad palaces with U.S. - paid - for mercenary guards , ignorant and contemptuous of the Iraq that had passed them by , and where they were now powerless , even with the might of the Pentagon behind them -- relied on the Americans .
Rumsfeld , as always , relied on himself .
The ranks trusted him -- and political decision - makers -- to know and manage post-Saddam politics in Iraq to secure the victory as well as to provide the political setting that fulfilled the military triumph .
When they failed miserably , condemning the American force to a corrupt , untenable occupation and slow - wasting attrition of men and prestige , the debacle was complete .
Beyond Iraq were his other lasting legacies .
As no other cabinet officer in history , he turned over crucial , self - sustaining functions of his department to privateers and private armies .
He surrendered vital supply and commissariat services for the American military to profit - plundering contractors for whom U.S. forces were neither fellow warriors , nor even share - holders , but captive `` customers '' to be treated with the offhandedness afforded by guaranteed contracts .
He ceded security and combat functions essential to the national mission to a corps of thousands of hired guns whose qualifications , standards of conduct and ultimate loyalty -- all integral to the safety and success of American forces -- were beyond effective governmental control or measure .
-LRB- Exposed in a Congressional hearing February 7 , the scandal of the infamous Blackwell Security Corporation , shirking amid vast profit the arming and protection of its own ranks , would be only a glimpse of the larger disgrace . -RRB-
Not since the British hired hordes of Hessians to crush George Washington 's revolutionary army had a military force tracing to America been so utterly mercenary .
The potential direct and indirect levy on policy and the armed forces would not be known for years .
As no other cabinet officer in history , he squandered the integrity of his department and the unique , indispensable code of honor of its services .
He joined , and often led , the rest of an intellectually degraded administration , heedless of Constitutional and human rights , in violating the very heart of their ostensibly conservative convictions .
With the ready sanctioning , and then de facto cover - up of torture and abuse at Abu Ghraib , Guantanamo , and the less noticed but equally gruesome prisons at Bagram Air Base and elsewhere in Afghanistan , he changed , for untold millions , the symbol of America and its once - proud military from freedom and the rule of law to the unforgettable prisoner 's hood and shackles .
Rumsfeld 's impact would not vanish with terms of office or elections .
By the very nature of contracts , personnel practices , and imparted ethics -- some of Washington 's most permanent monuments -- his legacies would remain deep in the tissue and soul of the institution he was entrusted to lead .
At the end , a pathetic climax to his more than four decades either in government or imploringly on its threshold , there was only his hackneyed memo on Iraq policy -- leaked , even more pathetically , in an apparent attempt somehow to vindicate him after all .
Thus , he growled that the Iraqi regime , like some seedy wrestling team , should `` pull up its socks '' ; and , most poignantly , ever the politician conducting lethal policy as politics , he advised that Washington `` announce that whatever new approach the US decides on , the US is doing so on a trial basis .
This will give us the ability to re-adjust and move to another course , if necessary , and therefore not ' lose . ' ''
As he left office for the last time , it would be only the loss that mattered .
As a pathologically unfit president struggled to recoup his historic blunder , as the neocons and Israeli lobby pressed on a gullible media and restive but still captive Congress the myth of an Iranian nuclear threat , as the Navy and Air Force , lesser actors in the Iraq action , promised wondrous results in Persia , the chaos and ineffable danger were left to Robert Gates , the puffy courtier .
Weeks after Rumsfeld 's departure , history -- the little ever really known or understood -- was already being waved off , forgotten .
The past was too complicated and troublesome , too guilt - ridden and close to home , too filled with chilling consequences .
The worst of it was the most basic and damning .
Donald Rumsfeld and all he represented , all he did and did not do , came out of us .
The undertaker 's tally , including Iraq , was compiled at our leave , one way or another , at every turn .
His tragedy was always ours .
Roger Morris , who served in the State Department and on the Senior Staff of the National Security Council under Presidents Johnson and Nixon , resigned in protest at the invasion of Cambodia .
He then worked as a legislative advisor in the U.S. Senate and a director of policy studies at the Carnegie Endowment , and writes this Rumsfeldian history from intimate firsthand knowledge as well as extensive research .

If you 're Arlington County , you create a new vision for the boxy buildings and subterranean passageways in Crystal City that will be emptied by the federal Base Realignment and Closure Commission .
In place of the sterile monoculture that now characterizes the office complex near the Pentagon , members of an advisory task force see a more lively street - level scene with a greater mix of shops , restaurants and offices .
Writes WaPo reporter Annie Gowen :
-LSB- Board of Supervisors Chairman Chris -RSB- Zimmerman and others speaking yesterday said that the vounty sees the empty space as an opportunity to `` reimagine '' and `` brand '' Crystal City as an attractive destination .
Though close to Reagan National Airport and dense with hotels , the area has long been seen as a gloomy 1960s era enclave of offices connected by underground passages .
But parts of Crystal City have lately seen a rebirth , thanks to an influx of trendy cafes and a new streetscape ....
Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty , which owns 7.4 million of the 11 million square feet of office space in the neighborhood , has spent $ 40 million on improvements to enliven the streets and attract new businesses .
It turned Crystal Drive into a two - way main street and has recruited new shops and chic restaurants such as Jaleo and McCormick & Schmick 's .
Reading between the lines of Gowen 's story , however , there seems to be one big missing piece :
Housing .
Creating a livelier commercial district is a worthy goal .
But creating a balanced community with a mix of housing , offices , shopping and other amenities -- allowing people to live close to where they work and play -- is an even more worthy goal .
As Ed Risse has pointed out , the relocation of 17,000 jobs creates a rare opportunity to create a genuine balanced communities in Northern Virginia .
The problem , I surmise -- it 's not discussed in the story -- is that Arlington is concerned about protecting its tax base , which means replacing the vacated offices with new offices , not housing .
It 's hard to fault Arlington for pursuing its short - term self interest .
But everyone needs to recognize that Arlington 's decision not to pursue a balanced community means that housing will end up somewhere else , presumably in outlying counties .
And employees working in the buffed up Crystal City will wind up commuting long distances and clogging Northern Virginia thoroughfares .
And the cry for new transportation revenues will grow ever more deafening .
Right on .
Did n't I read somewhere that some of those office buildings were considered worn out and that they would be demolished and replaced rather than refurbished ?
Would that be an opportunity for more mixed use ?
Is it an example of `` existing infrastructure '' that is worn out and outlived its usefuleness ?
This post has been removed by the author .
Jim , minor point -
unlike most other Virginia counties , Arlington County does not have a Board of Supervisors .
It does have a County Board .
Members of the Arlington County Board are addressed not as supervisors , but as Board Members .
If Arlington has sufficient public infrastructure to support housing at Crystal City , adding housing to that area would be an excellent idea .
The question that the Arlington community needs to answer is : Whether the supporting infrastructure is sufficient ?
If not , what is the incentive for Arlingtonians to dig deeper in their pockets to pay for public infrastructure so that the housing does not get constructed in outlying counties ?
The funds run one way from Arlington , just as they do from Fairfax -- down to Richmond and then around the state .
Moreover , while I 'm sure that many people would enjoy the urban life of a newly revitalized Crystal City , many others would not .
Many people simply want to live in single family , detached homes that will not be available in Crystal City .
Further , any housing built in that area will likey be quite costly given the price of land and the costs to construct high - rise buildings .
Ray Hyde has persuaded me that we need to provide incentives for good quality , higher paying jobs to locate in outlying areas .
There probably are n't enough tax dollars -- even in the mind of John Chichester -- to fix NoVA 's transportation and other infrastructure problems that are , in large part , based on the high concentration of good - paying jobs here , along with a lack of both affordable housing .
Unless builders are going to supply affordable housing at a loss -- which , to me , seems absurd , there wo n't be affordable housing here without even more tax subsidies .
-LRB- Of course , every tax dollar spent on subsidizing housing is n't available for other purposes . -RRB-
That suggests sprawl will continue , as will the demand for more and more roads and other infrastructure .
Virginia needs balanced job growth .
In theory , the loss of these jobs presents an opportunity to do something different in terms of settlement patterns .
Perhaps to replace commercial businesses with housing and / or more balanced mixed - use .
Lots of questions here but I do agree .. just the potential concept is provocative ...
But , what would be the benefit to Arlington to do this ?
More specifically - what would be the benefit to those who already live and pay taxes in Arlington ?
What would Arlington have to provide in the way of additional infrastructure ?
-LRB- I 'm not sure that I would agree that more infrastructure would be needed for residential vs commercial but let 's explore it .
It would seem to be that if you took an office building in Crystal and converted it to apartments .. you 'd not have any more people -LRB- perhaps less -RRB- so you would n't need any more water / sewer capacity ... and ditto for parking places ... at least it would seem so -RRB- .
Ditto with commuting ...
instead of a hoard of folks `` in commuting '' from outer jurisdictions to Arlington every morning , would n't you have instead - more `` out '' commuting .
Finally , the folks who actually own the land - would they agree to a change in the zoning from Office Commercial to Apartment Residential ?
What would be the economics of this with respect to those who hold those properties as investments ?
It would seem - that Arlington and the other area jurisdictions have already had such a choice for years - and that they chose commercial development over residential - in effect - letting more remote jurisdictions figure out how to provide residential for folks who wanted to work in NoVa and commute to the outer suburbs to live .
To a certain extent - one could say that No Va jurisdictions have a responsibility to provide housing for those that work in the same area and NOT force workers to commute to outer jursidictions for housing in the first place .
In the end - every worker who , for whatever reason , ends up commuting ... that is one more person using the transportation network more intensively than those that live locally with shorter commutes .
So .. here 's a concluding thought .
What kind of an exercise would it be for each NoVa jurisdiction to total up the number of jobs in its boundaries verses the amount of housing within its boundaries .
Would we see a big disparity ?
I know where I live in the outer suburbs that there IS a big disparity in the opposite sense .
We have far , far more people in homes than we have jobs for them .
In other words a huge percent of our population are , in fact , NoVa commuters .
With respect to the jobs / housing question - I wonder what the totals would be for the entire NoVa area - all jursidictions with respect to jobs verses housing .
From an equity perspective - should jurisdictions provide as much housing as they have jobs ?
The mechanism for doing this would be zoning -
a certain percentage of areas would be reserved ONLY for residential development or areas designated for mixed use development would have a hard percentage cap on how much residential had to be part of the mixed - used proposal .
Or to turn this completely around - would folks support the right of any jurisdiction to zone entirely that jurisdiction for commercial / industrial ONLY and let outlying jurisdictions provide residential ?
In some respects , is n't that essentially what No Va jursidictions are doing - favoring non-residential development and letting other jursidictions handle the residential ?
Turning this on its head - what is the incentive for a worker in Crystal City to buy there ?
Most jobs now do n't last for decades - no one expects a career at a company any more .
I would n't buy a house for one specific job -
but if I bought at Crystal City , I 'd be locked in to that area .
What happens if my next job is in Silver Spring , or Leesburg , or Quantico ?
Am I supposed to buy and sell my house each time I change jobs ?
I 've been through six -LRB- high tech -RRB- jobs in the past 14 years - all while living at the same house , all good jobs and good career moves .
If I changed houses like the tech field requires you to change jobs , I 'd spend my entire life packing and unpacking .
Living where you work is one of those `` nice idea , not real practical '' kind of things .
Anonymous , you raise a legitimate point . People change jobs a lot ,
and no one can afford to move to a new house every time they get a new job .
That 's why people pay a premium to live in a central location --
it gives them proximity to a wider range of employment locations .
Larry , This is my personal conviction :
If local governments were not given the power to restrict housing development through zoning , a free market would provide a much better balance of housing / jobs / retail / amenities than what we have now .
The answer is less regulation , not more .
Jim : I believe in free markets as well , but I also hold that free markets are equally as free of economic subsidies as well as over - burdensome regulation .
What is the argument that letting people develop their property as desired without regard to the impact on existing residents and businesses is a free market ?
None of us would likely support the abolishment of all zoning as is basically the case in Houston .
Would we find it acceptable to allow the construction of a foundary in the middle of a residential neighborhood ?
What about building a 30 - story building in the flight path of Dulles Airport ?
Few of us would likely support that .
We have a serious problem with public infrastructure in areas of Virginia .
Few dispute that .
What we argue over is who is responsible to fund the necessary infrastructure ; to what amount ; and should people be permitted to build in the absence of adequate public facilities .
Reasonable people can answer these questions differently .
But , at some point , there is a question of basic equity that must be answered :
How much `` cost '' should society be able to impose on an existing resident / business so that someone else can use his or her property as they desire ?
Since we would n't permit the foundary to built in the residential neighborhood , we all effectively agree that there are limits to how much cost we are willing to impose on existing residents .
Stated alternatively , one does not have an absolute right to use his / her property as desired .
One question we might ask is : Who is the cost - causer ?
The answer is always going to be `` the newcomer . ''
One might also ask : At what point does it become unfair to load all of the costs on the newcomer ?
Few would likely argue that , because of the high forward - looking costs for constructing infrastructure , we should not permit any building in Virginia without the upfront payment of the total costs for constructing infrastructure .
That would be unfair .
But , at the very same time , is n't equally unfair to load all of the infrastructure costs on taxpayers -- especially given Virginia 's tax structure that takes much from NoVA and gives little back ?
One might be able to make a good argument that we could save transportation costs by building densely in NoVA .
But what about the other infrastructure costs that are then imposed on residents of NoVA ?
What 's in it for us ?
Re Dense Residential - See the article in today 's -LRB- 6 / 18 -RRB- WaPo .
It offers some interesting insights and observations , including the following : `` Gerald L. Gordon , president of Fairfax 's Economic Development Authority , said jobs will keep moving toward the fringes ,
because employers ' first priority is being near a qualified workforce , and residents continue to seek affordable , spacious homes and good schools in more distant communities . ''
More evidence that Ray Hyde 's `` we need more places '' theory has legs .
People who want to live in New York City tend to move there .
Why are we talking about spending billions of scarce tax dollars extending Metrorail when it is n't going to fix the transportation problems ?
BTW , check out the other story in the Post today about Fairfax County Supervisor Gerald Hyland 's involvement with a developer 's attempt to obtain huge conservation tax credits .
What else goes on between segments of the business community and the supervisors ?
re : WaPo article .
yes , agree it was excellent in describing the issues .
But I 'm perplexed ... as usual ...
`` because employers ' first priority is being near a qualified workforce , and residents continue to seek affordable , spacious homes and good schools in more distant communities . ''
I found this rather odd in that the concept of `` near '' is apparently perceived differently depending on whether you were an employer or an employee .
employers want to be `` near '' a qualified workforce but employees -LRB- note they use the word residents -RRB- continue to seek ... homes in more distant communities .
Unless I 'm not reading it properly ... it sounds like the employers ' concept of `` near '' is a very different concept than the employee 's concept of a `` near '' place to live .
Would n't one presume that the two concepts be the same ... that the employee would want to be near where a qualified workforce lives ... AND vice versa ?
Also ... discussed in BLOG was the idea that folks do n't want to move everytime they change jobs which is an excellent point but how does that explain folks who move to the outer burbs ... and then change jobs that requires even a longer commute ?
Are n't people who move to the outer burbs ... for housing .. locking themselves in to a less flexible situation the same way that someone would in trying to live next door to where they work because in both cases .. if they change jobs - they 've probably bought themselves a longer commute .
Is n't it curious the employers want to be near a qualified work force ?
Would n't that result in less travel rather than more ?
The other comment of interest was that most residents of mixed use communities do n't find employment there .
To the extent that some mixed use residents do find local employment that suits their skills , that is a good thing , and it will marginally reduce travel .
But we should not count on it as a panacea , and it does not conflict with the idea that we need more places .
`` Mixed use '' and `` more places '' are compatible ideas .
The article should put to rest the argument that Ed Risse and I have had about job growth .
His previous statement was that while the percet job growth in PW was high the absolute number was small .
Today we see that the absolute numbers are also higher .
If we choose to have a successful transportation plan then we should design the plan to meet the needs which will occur as a result of what is happening , rather than to meet the needs of what we wish would happen .
Otherwise you have to design not only a transportation plan but a way to change everyone 's decisions in such a way as to make it work .
Today 's article shows how difficult that is , so why choose a plan that is bound to fail ?
Metro will not ease congestion and it has n't done so for the last thirty years .
What it does do is allow more people to travel to some places than can be acommodated by highways .
It does that by offering a lower level of service and less comfort -LRB- standing room only -RRB- .
It might be that there is still sufficient reason to spend billions of scarce dollars on Metro , but easing traffic congestion is n't one of them .
We should evaluate the expenditure for what it does do and who benefits and assign the costs accordingly , if the expenditure is still reasonable .
Clearly , that does not include billing the tollroad users for Metro construction .
Making Route 7 sixteen lanes is probably just as bad an idea as Metro .
That is just another plan to take everyone to the same place , which we know will fail .
The difference is that those who use that route will have individually controlled climate , music , and seats .
And they can eat or smoke if they choose .
Aside from Gerald Gordon 's comments , you have Jay Fissette saying that we have not fully made the connection between land use and transportation .
I 'd say that most people have made the connection and that the one Jay is proposing is just wrong .
Then , of course , there is the apparently obligatory and generally clueless comment by Stewart Schwartz that such articles always seem to include .
In this case he makes the completely unsupported and obviously wrong statement that the conditions cited in the article leave everybody worse off .
If he wants to voice the opinion that the wrong people are making money in the wrong places , that 's different ;
but the claim that everybody is worse off is patently false and weakens the rest of his arguments accordingly .
As for conservation easements , do n't get me started .
When hundreds of organizations are founded to accept gifts from thousands of people , then stories like Hyland 's are inevitable .
If conservationists want to conserve land , then they need to raise the money and go buy it .
That means that they will need to set priorities as to what land is most worth saving and give up on the idea of saving 95 % of it , for free .
Or , we can come up with some method of providing continuing income to those that are already conserving the land .
A one shot , partial payment in the form a conservation easement can not possibly conserve the land forever .
Even when land is publicly owned , we ca n't count on conservation continuing .
Maryland has proposed selling land to raise money , Fairfax to support affordable housing , and The Vint Hill Economic Development Authority is arguably the largest developer in Fauquier .
In a situation where the public c n't afford to keep their lands clear , what chance is there for the private individual ?
re : infrastructure costs and newcomers
all things being equal .. a newcomer in NoVa needs infrastructure to support them in not very different ways that - that same newcomer in the outer burbs would need similar infrastructure -
and it IS the infrastructure costs that are much more at issue than density per se because discussions of density .. seem to always flow back to infrastructure and not focus on density itself as a good or bad thing .
If a newcomer did not have enough money to have a garage on their new house - people would be up in arms if their property taxes were taken to pay for that new garage
but apparently folks ' views of this become less clear if we 're talking about taking people 's money to pay for .. say a new classroom .. or a new library or fire station or traffic light or widened roadways .
I think property owners are willing for the most part to pay their fair share -
but if the growth rate is high - where there is a huge influx of newcomers then we have significant money issues .
For instance , our locality has to build a new school every year and I understand that Loudoun has to build several new schools every year .
Schools are over 70 % of our property taxes .
Without proffers - our taxes would have easily doubled and then some not to mention what would happen to the elected officials who approved those tax increases .
Everyone needs a place to live
but I will point out that when a newcomer buys a home twice and three times as big as the typical house in the outer burbs .. commutes solo in a -LRB- usually new -RRB- SUV 50 miles a day and then expects folks of much more modest means to pick up the infrastructure tab .. that there will be complaints .
`` Another way of looking at this is that if new folks had to pay their actual share of infrastructure costs - there would be less money for bigger homes and new SUV and long solo commutes . ''
And when we have all taxpayers picking up the tab for these infrastructure costs - there is no incentive on the part of the new folks - to make conservative financial decisions -
because , in essence , they are being subsididzed .
The more that each person has to pay their own fair share of infrastructure costs - the more it will impact the choices that have expensive consequences - for either them .. or for others .
I pointed out in another post the problems of planned communities .
There , the existing residents have not paid enough to support the common use land and common use infrastructure , with the result that these communities are now resorting to assessing additional fees , but only on newcomers .
In this case the newcomers are not causing any new requirements ,
but they are still being expected to pay a higher price than existing residents , and for facilites that were worn out -LRB- by existing residents -RRB- before the new residents arrived .
It seems to me that this exposes a critical weakness in what we psychologically view as fair .
I would agree with Larry if : a -RRB- existing residents were already paying enough to support existing infrastructure , which they are apparently not .
-LRB- At least that is a widely held belief . -RRB-
b -RRB- the additional costs -LRB- for proffers and such -RRB- over and above ordinary and sufficient property taxes were carefully examined to cover only the new and extraordinary capital costs associated solely with new residents .
That means that you can not blame the new residents for increased capital costs that are really in support of new desires or needs on the part of all residents .
Say crime is up 50 % so you need a new jail .
At the same time new residents are planned to be up 25 % .
How much of the cost of the new jail should the new residents pay ?
Are you going to hold them responsible for the 50 % of increased need that is due to existing residents ?
I understand Larry 's point ,
but I think it is intellectually too easy to be correct .
I particularly like this : Another way of looking at this is that if new folks had to pay their actual share of infrastructure costs - there would be less money for bigger homes and new SUV and long solo commutes .
That is absolutely correct ,
and it corresponds to EMR 's gloomy prediction that we will all face lowered expectations .
But what if the choice is a smaller home in the exurbs and a hybrid ?
It is a fine argument ,
but I do n't think we know anywhere near enough to actually and fairly assess the costs of new infrastructure , on the one hand .
On the other hand , if the newcomers pay for their own infrastructure , especially if we *require* them to pay for their own infrastructure , then we should not be too surprised if they claim to own it and wish to exclude us .
This has already happened with some gated communities .
They provided things like bike paths , and now the outside community wants connectivity to those assets without picking up part of the costs .
It is the same with riparian setbacks and other increased demands on private income or property .
I do n't see how we can expect it to be shared infrastructure that we all benefit from unless we share some of the costs .
At present , we ca n't even agree on what `` some of '' amounts to , let alone if it is a fair distribution .
What if the choice is between a larger home and an SUV in the exurbs or a smaller home and maybe no car in the inner areas , AND AT A HIGHER PRICE , including travel ?
Policy Soup hsa a comment on the same subject that says , `` I lived in Crystal City for many years after college .
The Underground was , and remains , the greatest feature .
The only drawback to Crystal City was no yards .
The location was great , but the place was too urban for anyone with a family .
The higher density development that has been going on there for the past five years or so is a crime -
you ca n't even cross the street on foot , everything is so congested !
So much for the `` pedestrian friendly '' model -
Arlington seems determined to kill pedestrians , forcing people who used to walk to drive two blocks like in Clarnedon due to overcrowding .
Let 's pray they stop compounding their errors , lest the whole place decline . ''
It may turn out that we need more space not just to live and travel , but to make way for difference of opinion .
re : newcomers / infrastructure / longevity
Well .. I do n't think infrastructure `` wears out '' in the usual sense but I do accept the premise for some things .
Roads and water / sewer are not replaced .
They are , instead , maintained .
Schools and Prisons and other buildings can eventually wear out and need replacement .
But I am talking about new infrastructure that would not be needed if an area was not experiencing growth .
All communities have CIPs -LRB- capital investment plans -RRB- for infrastructure - both replacement and but replacement infrastructure IS something that can be accomodated in an annual budget - much like figuring out how many buses the school system needs to replace - every year -
it 's a known calculation .
But new infrastructure is not because it depends on the RATE of growth
and I think there would be strenuous disagreement with the claim that `` That means that you can not blame the new residents for increased capital costs that are really in support of new desires or needs on the part of all residents . ''
because existing residents are not getting `` better '' levels of services but rather expensive measures necessary to simply maintain their existing levels of service .
Most communities would not willinging choose nor think fair that it is the existing residents ' financial responsibility to pay for new infrastructure for new residents .
Remember , we 're not talking about a new classroom to replace the older , worn - out one .
We 're talking about a new ADDITIONAL classroom .

Well , gasoline in Richmond has hit $ 3.00 a gallon , or just shy of it ,
and I spent $ 48 filling up the gas tank of my Jeep --
the most I 've ever paid for in my life .
I 'm not happy about it ,
but I do n't see high gas prices as a reason to start foaming at the mouth and chewing on the carpet .
Others feel less constrained .
The hysteria over rising gas prices has reached a fever pitch .
The economic ignorance of the sound bites and commentary I 've seen on national television knows no bounds .
Demagogues are calling for self - destructive taxes on oil company profits , oblivious to the reality that , in a capitalist society , profits are a critical signal that guide the flow of capital .
-LRB- 1 -RRB- If you confiscate Exxon Mobil 's profits , you reduce the capital available to the world 's largest oil company to invest in more exploratory drilling , new oil wells , new pipelines , new refineries , etc.
-LRB- 2 -RRB- If you tax oil industry profits , you also reduce the incentive for owners of outside capital to invest in new capacity .
Why bother if the profits will be taxed away ?
Here in Virginia , a semblance of sanity still reigns .
Gov. Timothy M. Kaine has not yet proposed anything as breath - takingly stupid as the proposals emanating from Washington , D.C. .
The Governor has said he will investigate reports of `` price gouging , '' which , given the fact that the the concept of `` price gouging '' is meaningless and impossible to define , means he will , for all practical purposes , do nothing ....
Which is exactly what he should do .
Nothing .
Virginians and Americans will adapt to higher gas prices if government does not interfere .
-LRB- The Governor also is considering applying for a waiver of federal regulations requiring cleaner gasoline be sold in Virginia 's major metro areas , but has not yet made a determination .
See the Times - Dispatch report .
Unfortunately , he 's sticking to his guns on trying to raise $ 1 billion for transportation projects without raising gasoline taxes -- a topic for another post .
As I have been hammering away relentlessly on this blog -LRB- See `` A World with One Billion Cars '' -RRB- , the world economy is moving from a 20 - year era of cheap petroleum to a plateau of more expensive petroleum .
This shift is driven by the combination of -LRB- a -RRB- escalating world consumption of petroleum , especially in rapidly developing economies like China and India , and -LRB- b -RRB- the peaking of global oil production capacity , the increasing expense of exploiting the remote and isolated oil reserves that remain , and terrorist / political instability in oil - producing countries .
This is not the oil companies ' fault .
This is not Dick Cheney 's fault .
This is not the auto industries ' fault .
It is not the environmentalists ' fault .
It 's the reality of geology and geopolitics .
The American public can adapt to the new global realities by changing their energy - intensive lifestyles ,
and politicians can help them by speaking honestly and forthrightly about why the price of gasoline is increasing , instead of demagoguing the issue for short - term political gain .
Here in Virginia , the General Assembly has been examining what Virginia can do to increase energy production .
That is OK , as far as it goes .
But there is nothing that Virginia can do to increase the global supply of oil , and probably little it can do to increase the petroleum refining capacity needed to convert oil to gasoline .
What the political and business leadership of Virginia has so far failed utterly to do is admit that Virginia is acutely vulnerable to oil price shocks .
Virginians consume more gasoline per capita than the national average , in part because our transportation policy is geared toward matching every increase in automobile travel with an increase in transportation capacity with no thought of modulating travel demand .
But reality is a stubborn thing .
With each increase in the price of gasoline , the bankruptcy of the old order becomes increasingly evident .
Let us hope that Gov. Kaine , who prides himself on straight talk , begins leveling with the people of Virginia .
Jim - You are right on the money about how capitalism works ,
so why not try to make capitalism really work for Virginia .
The future in transportation belongs to the nation , company or person who develops the alternative to gasoline powered automobiles .
Why not do everything we can to assure that future arises from Virginia ?
Rather than drilling for oil and gas off the Atlantic Coast , we should be offering enormous incentives for comapnies and individuals who want to work on alternative fuel solutions to locate their business here .
You can encourage R&D on alternative fuels with grants and tax breaks .
AND , you can work to increase supply .
The one and only oil refinery in the Commonwealth is nearby in Yorktown .
They could double their capacity without leaving the premises .
Why has n't the company applied to builf new facilities on site ?
By all means explore for oil and gas in the Atlantic .
Jim : Speaking seriously here , many families -LRB- including my own -RRB- have already cut back in every way possible .
What then ?
My office , home and children 's schools are all within a 6 mile radius .
Vacations are already a thing of the past .
We 've cut back on groceries .
I 'd trade the car on a hybrid ,
but it 's paid for
and who can afford a car payment what with mortgage rates being what they are and three kids ...
So , I ask seriously , what are average hard - working families to do ?
Andrea : How about a couple of hundred dollars ?
If the GA repealed the unnecessary sales tax from last year , then the average citizen would pick up some cash .
Or , the GA could actually cut the sales tax
and you would keep some more of your money .
Check out how much the Republican Senators want you to pay in other , new taxes too - to register your car , etc.
Jim : I like the graphic ,
it takes two arms and two legs to fill up our tank .
The only answer to cutting the cost of mobility and access is settlement patterns that require less vehicle travel and support more effecient shared - vehicles when one must resort to any vehicle .
That is what an understanding of Jane Jacobs suggested 40 years ago -LRB- not just in `` Life and Death ... but also `` The Economy of ' Cities ' . ''
Let us , honor Ms. Jacobs 's memory with an understanding of the need for Fundamental Change .
EMR
JAB - Got ta love it .
Yup , a couple of hundred dollars is going to save the day !
Jane Jacobs knew the difference between a community and a construction plan .
Was n't one of her main arguments that you can not plan everything , and you should allow communities to be what they are and what they become ?
Did n't she fight Robert Moses because he thought he had too much control over other peoples ' lives ?
Somehow I doubt she would have gotten on board with fundamental change if it involved massive central and regional planning .
Andrea , One option may be telecommuting a couple of days a week .
Other than that , here 's the hard truth :
There 's not much that average , hard - working families can do in the short run to cope with higher gas prices except hope that their paychecks keep pace with inflation .
What you should NOT do is support demagogic political ploys that make problems worse , not better .
In the longer run , you can support more pedestrian friendly , transit - friendly development patterns that give you and your family more transportation options .
You should support development patterns that allow compatible uses -LRB- houses , small office buildings , small retail shops -RRB- to be located close to each rather than scattered all over .
How much money could you save if you could get by with only one car instead of two ?
What would it mean if you lived in a place where your children could walk to school ?
Think outside the box .
Kingfish , I 'm all in favor of alternate fuels .
Converting biomass to ethanol seems to be one that is self - sustaining economically without massive incentives .
I 'd favor government - sponsored research to devise technologies that would make ethanol more competitive ,
but I do n't like the idea of subsidizing specific business enterprises .
Once you give them a subsidy , they never let go , no matter how much the world changes around them .
Witness the mohair subsidies put into place during World War II .
I tend to agree with Jim that markets function best , so long as no one has a finger on the scale .
Many believe that zone pricing , which is generally used by oil companies , is inconsistent with our antitrust laws -LRB- Section 13 of the Robinson - Patman Act -RRB- .
Others disagree .
Does zone pricing constitute a finger on the scale ?
If so , should the GA outlaw zone pricing ?
Toomanytaxes : Zone pricing is the mechanism the oil companies use to make sure that we pay the same price as people in states with higher gas taxes .
Only , we pay the extra few cents per gallon to them rather than into our state transportation accounts .
Considering the wide variety in local and state fuel taxes the near uniformity of the pump price across state lines is ... curious .
I was recently on the webpage for the Energy Information Agency
and their cost of fuel adjusted for inflation chart demonstates that we have been at $ 3 per gallon measured in 2005 dollars before .
It is about the historic peak in real prices ,
but it is hardly unprecedented , and not worth quite the hype or hysteria it is generating .
It is hard to imagine a company or a family that can not improve its efficiency and reduce consumption ,
and that is not a bad outcome at all .
Like you , Jim , I see the bright silver lining .
I seem to be getting more questions whenever I pull up in my hybrid .
One data point .
2:53 Why are gas prices often significantly different for the same brand between Prince William and Fairfax Counties and even at different locations within the same county ?
Zone pricing is trying to do much more than reflect different tax rates .
Take a look at the following link : http://www.gasbuddy.com/gb_gastemperaturemap.aspx
Assuming the general accuracy of the data underlying the map ,
differences in do not explain zone pricing .
Look at Arizona , for example .
There are much higher transportation costs in and around the Grand Canyon and much more competition in the Phoenix market .
Yet , Phoenix prices tend to be signficantly higher .
Ditto for taxes .
From what I quickly found on the Internet , total fuel taxes for the following four states are VA -LRB- 37.7 cents -RRB- ; Utah -LRB- 42.5 cents -RRB- ; NC -LRB- 45.6 cents -RRB- and Montana -LRB- 46.2 cents -RRB- .
However , both Montana and Utah have average prices that are significantly lower than either VA or NC .
There 's probably less relationship to costs and zone pricing than the oil companies want the public to believe .
I had a conversation with a friend the other day who owns an SUV
and he is n't worried about the price of gas because he travels less than 10 miles a day ..
yes ..
it 'll cost more ...
so he 'll have to cut back on his gourmet coffee ... two cups rather than three . :--RRB-
seriously - it 's about how far folks choose to drive and how folks define phrases like `` I must and have no choice '' .
It takes a hard knock for folks to take a hard look at things they always assumed could not change .
I predict ... lots of folks will be taking harder looks at whether or not choices are choices or no choice '' is truly no choice .
I know it happened during the gas crisis ...
and as bad as it is now - this is not as bad as then - though if $ 3 a gallon is in the rear view mirror and $ 4 a gallon on the horizon and coming fast ... we might think so ...
.. but I would bet that folks would choose -LRB- there 's that word again -RRB- $ 4 or even $ 5 a gallon rather than waiting in line for 3 hours only to find out the guy in front of you got the last tankful .
America 's love affair with the automobile is about to be revisted though I doubt seriously a divorce is anywhere near ... :--RRB-
sorry .. my attitude is grin and bear it ...
it 's sort of like coffee doubling in price ...
my property accessment going up 300 % -LRB- which it did -RRB- ...
... and today .. I paid $ 68 bucks to fill up my 89 Ford Van .
I got ta talk to Ray Hyde about that Hybrid .... he 's got ..
he said if he had to choose .. he 'd keep his truck ... :--RRB-
Did I really say that ?
That would be a tough `` choice '' .
With the truck I 'd have some chance of making money ,
but I 'd hate to have to drive it if it was n't working .
If you have to drive , the hybrid is a joy .
Dead silent , dirt cheap , reliable , little bit of capital cost detriment , sufficient power .
48 mpg if you drive at 75+ like a maniac .
I remember people sniffing at it , saying they would n't do it because the payback on capital was n't there .
I drone on about costs and benefits , but a -RRB- that 's not everything , and b -RRB- sometimes circumstances change .
I 'm going to have to send a letter to the guv'nor .
I have a bunch of vehicles and only use the appropriate one for the task at hand .
I need a portable license plate and insurance , otherwise the current `` tax '' plan is going to kill me .
I sure hope that those of you who think saving open space and farms will chip in and help out on this :
send a letter .
I do n't mind paying what it costs to drive or paying what I owe ,
but this is going to be whacked .
I suspect that overhead costs might have something to do with fuel prices .
That gas station in Fairfax is sitting on expensive land and paying high taxes .
Businesses are `` tax positive '' do n't cha know .
If people really do start making different choices , it 's going to be fun to watch real estate prices .
BTW 13 % more new home sales last year , in spite of higher rates ,
but prices were down 5k .
Time to demand another reassessment .
Ray Hyde : Taxes are indeed business overhead that affect retail prices .
But I still suggest that zone pricing has more to do with computer software and data - mining than actual costs .

MICHAEL JACKSON
MANCHILD IN A PROMISED LAND
by ROBERT J. LEWIS
He 's such an easy target , Michael Jackson .
He makes even the weirdest of the weird feel normal .
But unlike them , Jackson does n't try to hide the fact that he is easily one of the most screwed up beings on the planet .
Every time he checks in for yet another surgery , he is announcing to the world that he does n't know who he is , where he is going , and that he thoroughly loathes himself - at least the adult version .
And for his remarkable honesty , his most unprivate confessions , he is subjected to one public humiliation after another .
Who among us rock throwers would have the courage to reveal about ourselves what Michael has revealed about himself ?
Next to the towering monument that the unedited Michael Jackson is we are telephone booths ;
next to his singular guilelessness and candor , we are the multitude of the prevaricating and pusillanimous .
Everything Michael has done and said during the past 20 years has been against his own apparent self - interest , beginning with unrelenting surgical assaults on his erstwhile good looks , to hanging his child -LRB- and crotch for that matter -RRB- out to dry , to entering details of his bedroom antics into the public domain .
Like a typical Dostoievksy character , we can not account for the behavior if it were n't for an apparently overriding need to confess and proclaim -- over and against what the outside world wants to believe -- the truth of who we are .
The on - going spectacle of Michael 's increasingly bizarre conduct is his confession to the world that he is one spectacularly psychologically - challenged dude .
Like children who are incapable of dissimulating their basic wants and needs , Michael 's manner of being in the world is uncensored and spontaneous ,
and to such an unsuspected extent I propose he deserves to be considered one of the most authentic beings of this or any other century , and quite properly belongs to that exceptional society of authenticity - questers that would include Saint Augustine , Pascal and Heidegger .
The facts of Michael 's life have been well documented .
We know that by the age of 25 he was on top of the world .
Thriller had sold an unprecedented 50 million copies and Billie Jean had become the musical drug of choice in every corner of the world .
Not only was the song 's momentum and tension brilliantly crafted and fused , Michael 's riveting , counterpoint choreography - which remains unsurpassed -- revolutionized the way we simultaneously look at and listen to music .
Before disbelieving eyes , his torso , head and limbs supplied never - before - seen anatomical rejoinders to the notes -- like a guitarist filling in between the lyrics .
But from here on in , it would be downhill for the genre 's quintessential messenger , for Michael could no longer sustain the ' great lie ' he was living .
The child 's ' tin drum ' was beating ever louder in his head
and he intuitively understood that he was developmentally under - equipped to handle the adult pressures of stardom .
Far more compelling than the promise of even greater fame and fortune was the example of Oskar , from Gunther Grass ' The Tin Drum -LRB- 1959 -RRB- , which tells the story of a boy who refuses to grow up , who , through his drumming , rejects the adult world and the horrors taking place in Nazi Germany .
Like Oskar , Michael had witnessed firsthand the abominations of adult behaviour and refused to sign up .
From his earliest years , Michael Jackson was subjected to both extreme psychological and physical abuse at the hands of his status - obsessed father , who designated Michael as the vessel into which he would mercilessly pour the acid of his unrealized ambitions .
To this single end , Joe Jackson was ruthlessly single - minded .
Michael was terrified of him , whose mere presence could induce nausea .
At the age of 5 , the father yanked the son from his pail and sandbox existence and made him run Hollywood 's grimmest gauntlets .
The little mouse that Michael was suddenly found himself in the rat race and quickly learned to hate it ,
and like Oskar , who found respite in the beating of his tin drum , Michael found solace on stage , performing his music .
But the stage could not provide Michael with immunity against the constant encroachment of the adult world .
Listen to his rapid breathing in especially Off the Wall and Thriller : the staccato - like panting of a stalked animal , the desperate breath of human panic , and his small boy 's voice hiding behind the mesmerizing slash and blur of arms and legs fending off an invisible attack .
From one track to the next , the lyrics are n't so much sung as frantically whispered , the vowels cut short to the quick .
Michael was announcing that he could no longer follow the course Father and Hollywood had staked out for him , that the disparity between his real self and the role he was thrust into had reached unsustainable incommensurability .
Only the child within could save the defenceless adult from the depredations of the adult world ,
and from this point on , Michael would reduce the project of his life to letting the world know the truth of who he was : a confused , fragile , lost soul in search of care and love .
By the time Michael had attained mythic status , he was so far removed and alienated from himself , he would have to shed , over a period of 20 years and still counting , one skin after another before his true self could begin to emerge .
As we might expect from someone so radically self - estranged , the result has been nothing less than a metamorphosis .
Michael 's journey of self - discovery is a work in progress like no other because it increasingly depends on the accommodation of two irreconcilables : the child and adult as one .
More revealing of itself than its favorite target , public opinion has not seen fit to grant Michael the inalienable right to his confused mental state and ' off the wall ' comportment .
If most people subscribe to the notion that black and white are not only skin colors but states of mind , why are we baffled or offended when Michael , who was introduced to the white ways of Hollywood at the age of 5 , tells us that he is n't sure what his true color is ?
Robbed of his childhood , abused by a psychotic father and then prematurely subjected to the adult pressures of the entertainment world , why are we surprised to learn that Michael does n't want to grow up , that he prefers the company and community of children , that he wants to be protected and looked after ?
Every time the androgynous Jackson goes under the knife he is crying out that he does n't know if he is man or woman , child or adult , black or white .
As if we would have done otherwise in his situation ?
And to the never - ending suspicion that Michael is a child abuser , what crime has been committed when two experimenting 11 - year - olds fool around sexually ?
If you believe that Michael has the mentality of an 11 - year - old , -LRB- and there has n't been much evidence to the contrary during the past 20 years -RRB- he should not have had to defend himself against accusations of child molestation .
Was it in defense of perversity or his incorrigible innocence that convinced him that it was OK to reveal that he shared his bed with children ?
More questionable , even criminal , than Michael 's alleged fooling around with other kids , were the parents who allowed , even encouraged their children to sleep over and perhaps share the same bed with someone whose sexual predilections have been suspect since 1991 .
On June 13 , 2005 , the courts found Michael not guilty of the charges brought against him .
However , those whose minds were decided on his guilt before the trial began will not be changed by the verdict , just as Michael 's essential nature will not have changed .
Mahatma Gandhi writes that ' There is a higher court than courts of justice and that is the court of conscience . '
Only Michael knows if he is sexually attracted to children , and beyond that , if he has ever acted on those feelings .
And if we grant him the mental age of an 11 - year - old , who has nonetheless conventionally fathered two children , Michael is then a child trapped in an adult body .
Which means the crowning act in his quest for authenticity awaits one final operation .
What does a man do when he feels , acts and responds like a woman trapped in a man 's body ?
He undergoes sexual reassignment surgery and hormone therapy in order to become who ' she ' is .
There remains one final procedure that will totally liberate the child that Michael is .
When Michael finds the courage to act on what his duty toward other children demands -- submit to voluntary neutering -- which will be tantamount to his final confession , the saving grace and glory that is his Neverland will become his forever land .
Tennessee Williams has said for all time , `` there 's not enough kindness in the world . ''
And I say this to you , Michael Jackson , may your tribe increase .
Baker 's Stupidity , Al Hakim 's Straying , and the Ignorance of Arab Leaders .
Baker Asks for Fair Distribution of Oil Returns .
It is known that America steals oil returns , or that most of it falls in the hands of Safawis and Kurds .
How can the unjust be fair ?
And how could the thieves distribute fairly to others what they have stolen ?
Did America come to Iraq , other than to loot its oil wealth ?
Baker also asked for the dismantling of the militias .
Who can do that , when the whole American army failed to ?
Even the Iraqi police and the Iraqi army are a branch of the Badr militias , implementing Al Hakim 's sectarian program to cleanse Iraq of Sunnis .
In spite of Baker 's admission that Syria and Iran play a role in supporting the militias and the rebellion , and his admission that Iran considers it in its interest for the United States to submerge itself in the quagmire of Iraq , he asked for cooperation with and negotiation , as if the goal were the attempt to consolidate their efforts to eliminate resistance without affecting the general security in Iraq .
Reality highlights the contradiction between the givens Baker admits and the results he is seeking to achieve .
Baker also considers it necessary that the Iraqi government move to achieve tangible progress , forgetting - or ignoring - that it is incapable even of protecting itself , and that it is a sectarian government implementing its own agenda which is inflaming sectarian war in the country .
Baker asserted that the other security needs of the United States and the future of its army can not remain hostage to the Iraqi government 's actions or its incompetence .
This is a proof that the US army should escape from Iraq , whether the situation in Iraq improves or deteriorates
Baker asked for the return of Arab Baathists and Nationalists to the national life , with the symbols of Saddam Hussein 's regime .
The United States should encourage the return of qualified Iraqis , Sunnis , Shiites , nationalists , former Baathists , or Kurds , to the government .
For years , we have all followed this feverish interest of the Western powers , led by America , in Sudan and the events and conflicts that are happening there .
We have followed this international intervention to reach a solution to the problem of the south and the war that has been going on there for more than 20 years .
This intervention resulted in a peace agreement with unfair conditions that are considered a prelude to the separation of the south from the north and the creation of a Christian state in the south .
This feverish race did not quiet down after the signing of the agreement and its entering into the implementation phase , but it looked for another front to exploit in order to achieve its objectives .
That front was the -LRB- Darfur -RRB- region .
America and the major powers accused what they call -LRB- the Janjaweed Militias -RRB- of Arab origin of carrying out mass killings with the support of the Sudanese government , and launching a genocidal ethnic war against other tribes of African origin .
Even though they are all Muslims and the conflicts between the tribes in the -LRB- Darfur -RRB- region are old , all because of the encroachments made by shepherds on the fields of farmers to feed their flocks , the conflicts are settled by traditional councils whose decisions are binding on both sides .
In spite of all this , the imperialist forces , led by America , have invented an ethnic war and incidents of rape committed by Muslims against other Muslims and Muslim women .
These countries have taken it upon themselves to defend the rights of those oppressed Muslims against their oppressor brethren who are also Muslims .
If we know with certainty that America and Europe unceasingly wage war on Muslims and exterminate them every place on earth their hands can reach , what interest do they have in the case of -LRB- Darfur , -RRB- coming to intervene in defense of a group of Muslims ?!!
This is a puzzle .
The Special Force for Road Safety in the Qusaim district , Um Sedra Center , was able to arrest a Saudi person and another person of Arab nationality , after the second had smuggled a very large quantity of prohibited amphetamine pills , numbering more than 397 thousand pills inside his Mercedes car at exactly three in the morning , thinking that the early hour would help him go past the road guards on his way to Riyadh .
But the alertness of the road guards prevented the passing of this quantity on to our youth .
This is considered one of the biggest caches seized in the district .
The details of the case , after the arrest of the first person in whose possession were ten pills of the same kind that were seized , are that while there was no relation or connection between the two arrested men , the car was going back and forth between the Kingdom and his country , which made the road guards suspicious of a concealed matter .
Accordingly , the 1997 Mercedes vehicle was searched .
Plastic bags were found in the front and back doors , numbering 397 bags , each containing a thousand pills .
Immediately after they were seized , the arrested men were handed over directly to the Drug Combating Department .
He -LRB- Nasrallah -RRB- can raise his voice with curses , abuse and selected insults and no - one can keep up with him .
He says something and its opposite at the same time .
He excels in raising suspicions against his opponents and fabricating rumors to discredit them yet at the same time he states that he rejects any defamation of a Lebanese personality .
-LRB- .. -RRB-
He has refused the advice of friends and brothers and any intervention , by which he means Arab countries , and he is the one who receives huge funds and weapons from Iran , but does not consider this interference in Lebanese affairs .
He is the one who stood on March 8th , just a few days after Prime Minister Hariri was martyred , to declare his loyalty to Syria which left Lebanon , carrying with it the accusation of assassinating the martyred president .
-LRB- .. -RRB-
He alone decides to undertake momentous decisions such as decisions of war and peace .
He engaged in the kidnap of two Israelis at a very bad time , at the height of the summer season , and was also responsible for Lebanon being destroyed economically .
He orders Shiite ministers to resign in order to topple the government and threatens to appoint a new government as if he were the one ruler of Lebanon .
So where is the partnership ?
Hizbollah 's secretary - general accuses some elements of March 14th of being in contact with the Americans to prolong the war against Hizbollah .
If his intelligence has reached such a degree of supremacy , why does he not disclose to us who assassinated Prime Minister Hariri , may God have mercy on him ?
-LRB- .. -RRB-
Mr. Hassan Nasrallah has become the one who hands out certificates for patriotism , treason , cleanliness and filth .
And it is he who decides who is qualified to hold the premiership and who is not ; what a unique and strange personality this person is !
He asked for a judicial panel to be set up to look into what he has been accused of .
We now insist on an Arab - Lebanese judicial panel being set up to try him and hold him accountable for the many mistakes he has committed against us .
Indian newspapers published a human tragedy and a moral scandal of the temporary tourist marriage called " Mutaa " , which some Arab Shiites in India have been practicing for years .
They go to India every year .
They are elderly and they have money , and they marry poor , young Muslim girls .
After a month , the husband flees and returns to his country , abandoning wife and children , particularly if the wife is pregnant .
He even gives them false information about his address , so that he can run away from responsibility for the children .
One of these people continued to marry every year , for more than twenty years .
The last time he married a girl that turned out to be his daughter from his first tourist marriage in India .
The problem turned into a tragedy and a scandal for Muslims and Arabs in the Indian media .
This kind of spurious marriage , which takes advantage of girls ' poverty , caused awful human tragedies .
Many children produced by this marriage live without any identity , nationality or support .
Some countries imposed strict rules to protect girls from this type of injustice , by imposing harsh restrictions on marriage to foreigners .
In behavior that is strange to Saudi society , known for its rejection of all forms of violence , the Sports Center in the Kingdom circulated , with great pain and bitterness , an article that a Saudi sports forum had published for one of its members , in which he presented his plan to kill colleague Fahd Al Roqi , the sports journalist in the sister publication , " Al Riyadh . "
He asked for four people to help him to carry out his plan , and he explained in the forum the style of the operation in an accurate and detailed way , in addition to the weapon to be used and the assault operation .
This member had justified his threat against Al Roqi as the result of the suppression of Nasrawi fans of the injustice inflicted upon them , and of Al Roqi 's statements towards them , and the Al - Hilali media flipping the facts in its team 's favor , which harms the interests of Al Nasr , and what happened in the match between Al Hilal and Al Nasr in terms of events and unfair refereeing favoring Al Nasr - as he stated .
The colleague , Al Roqi , refused to comment on this issue on the " kooorah " website , asserting that he constantly receives threats via mobile text messages or unknown calls .
For their part , the Saudi crowds expressed through their forums their rejection of such things , calling for enthusiasm and reactions not to be accepted and threatening people 's lives due to football games , the goal of which is to entertain the youth and create honorable competition .
The question that arises , is what is happening a beginning of sport riots that might develop into something with bad repercussions ?
And who is responsible for such matters ?
The club administrations and the media should stand firm against those who want to take the Saudi sports backwards .
In a press interview , the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said that major democratic countries with nuclear capabilities , such as the United States , France , Russia and Israel , do not threaten to exterminate and crush states and nations .
Olmert was referring to Iranian President Ahmedinejad 's statements about wiping Israel off the map ... but what is significant here in these statements is the mention of Israel as one of the major countries in the nuclear club , although this is not true from a procedural point of view .
However , this is the first time an Israel official , represented in the form of the Israeli Prime Minister , has formally mentioned that Israel possesses nuclear weapons .
While this came as no surprise to everyone near and far , this announcement disturbed and angered various Israeli forces , some of whom went about calling for Olmert 's resignation .
Since Israel started its nuclear program in the sixties with French assistance , it has been shrouded in mystery .
Voices emerged out of Israel strongly denying the existence of any Israeli nuclear weapons on the basis that no nuclear test explosions had been conducted inside Israel .
This is where an Arab stance was needed but everyone greeted the news coolly and calmly , as if the whole issue was of no concern to us , whether closely or remotely , or as if Israel were located at the North Pole .
An issue such as this really calls for an Arab position to be taken and anger to be expressed but it is as if Arab anger towards Israel is not allowed and is something that is forbidden to us .
The least requirement is to engage the international community in pressuring Israel into signing the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , which the majority of Arab and Islamic countries have signed , including Egypt and Iran .
There are some bad habits that a great majority of people have .
They think there is no harm in them , and that they are even good habits , though they might put our health on the edge .
We can mention some of them in brief below :
drinking tea after eating .
It is known that tea contains tannin , a substance that inhibits the absorption of iron by the intestines , which deprives the body of it .
Consequently , the body could become anemic .
There is no doubt that tea is beneficial at more than one level , but we should be cautious of excessive drinking of it , as its detriments could outweigh its benefits
It is better to drink tea outside of meal times .
As for the quantity , it ranges from two to three cups per day , no more .
Whoever drinks more , has only himself to blame .
Using frying oil over and over .
Frying oil repeatedly makes it oxidize and , as a result it releases compounds that are harmful to the body , especially to the arteries .
Moreover , research has shown that these compounds play a role in causing cancer .
The best thing that can be done is to throw away oil after frying in it for the first time .
Some try to add new oil to old oil .
This is like the saying " pouring oil on fire . "
Adding salt to meat before it is grilled .
This habit is very bad , because salt absorbs water from the meat , and this drains the minerals and vitamins from it , particularly iron .
Meat should first be grilled and then the salt added to it .
In spite of the depressing scene engulfing the Arab world with its wars and crises , the balance of terror and the fear of escalating wars and crises may motivate those concerned into trying to find a way out of them , after each side has become aware of the dangers of escalation and the impasses ahead .
The past six years have seen the greatest degree of military escalation and political aggravation in all the crises in the Middle East , and neither escalation nor aggravation has helped achieve the specific agendas of any side that has worked to provoke or inflame these crises .
Without a doubt , the American administration is primarily responsible for igniting new crises or failing to put out old ones in the region .
Six years have passed during which first Sharon then Olmert , and with great support from Bush 's administration , used the highest degree of Israeli violence against the Palestinian people yet could not subjugate the Palestinians or put an end to their resistance .
The Israeli military apparatus also conducted an all - out offensive war on Lebanon , with the open support of Bush 's administration , and did not succeed in achieving its goals in spite of the widespread destruction it created .
As for Iraq , it has seen and continues to see the greatest degree of American military embroilment in the Middle East for the first time in the history of the region , which will have a profound effect on the fate of American interests and the future of Arab - American relations .
And many political and security crises will replicate from the womb of these wars in the lands of Palestine , Lebanon and Iraq , the most obvious of which is now the risk of sectarian , ideological and ethnic conflicts , in addition to conflicts relating to politics and the competition for power and authority , and at times even for opposition .
As a woman who sees herself as belonging to a conservative society , I have lived for many years of my life in ignorance of this world ...
My knowledge about male interests and their level of thinking and thought was limited to " what I saw " from my male relatives ... a small number I compared a whole world to ...
I began to read and think ... and found that the circle was wider than I had thought ...
My reading broadened ... and as it did , so did my wonder !
The relationship between men and women has never , in my opinion , been one of conflict ... also in comparison to my little world .
We might have a few lighthearted clashes ...
But I never thought there would be people on this earth who would embrace these ideas as belief !
I have read a lot about the marginalization of women ... their degradation ... their undervaluing ... by Arabs and foreigners ... by Muslims and disbelievers ... by the ancients and contemporary people .
Such talk would be met with anger and counter-attacks by some women ... by evasion and disregard by some ... and submission and defeat by others .
I have read a lot of proverbs that belittle women ...
But I have never read a proverb by a woman making fun of men ... how sensible women are ! :-LRB-
What is even nicer is that I did not find an offensive proverb about women by people whose intellect , knowledge , ideas and religion I value !
And if something like that came out of one of them at some moment ... they would quickly express regret and apologize !
We have lived for many years hearing , seeing and reading comparisons between men and women ...
It has come to be a received fact for some ...
Others dare to act upon some legal proofs to confirm men 's superiority over women in every aspect ... without exception ! Until we almost started to believe this .
This was how it was years ago ... until the worldwide web -LRB- internet -RRB- came !
I have navigated the depths of this sea for seven years .
And I still do ... dropping my anchor one day and raising it another . Facing clear , calm days ... and facing storms and hurricanes .
In the British Embassy in Egypt .. British Prime Minister Mr. Tony Blair stood .. and declared , after his meeting with President Mohamed Hosni Mubarak .. that the time has come to end the suffering of the Palestinian people .
Mr. Blair did not tell us that his British state was the one that created the tragedy , and that it is the first and last reason for this suffering ..
Our new generations , who do not read and do not understand .. would say how ..
To them we say that the people of Palestine were living safely and securely in their country , which was a Syrian province under Ottoman Sultanate rule ..
Britain came , and with it France , and engaged in a war with the Ottoman Sultanate .. to end the Islamic Caliphate ..
It used the Sharif of Mecca , Al Hussein Bin Ali , and his sons , Abdullah , Faisal , and Zaid , in a revolution they called Arabic in the National Geographic Region of Syria .. under a deceitful tempting promise that it would crown Al Hussein Bin Ali as King of the Arabs ..
The Syrians trusted the simpleton Sharif and revolted with him ..
So the Ottoman Sultanate and the Islamic Caliphate ended ..
Britain , and with it France , entered Syria .. which it had divided in advance , during the war and during the revolution , with its partner France in an agreement the Englishman Sykes made with the Frenchman Picot ..
Iraq and Palestine went to Britain , and Syria and Lebanon went to France ..
And during the war , the English Foreign Minister , Mr. Balfour , gave his promise to create a national homeland for the Jews in Palestine .
I want my voice and the voice of every citizen to be heard , male and female , who cares about the reputation of Medina , in the form and substance of our Muslim moral values , of what we the people of Medina , neighbors of the Messenger of God -LRB- Peace Be Upon Him -RRB- , see . ... because it makes the heart bleed and brings tears to the eyes ...
what we see on this street depresses us .
Unfortunately , it has turned into a street for immoral youth gatherings which distort the public image this street has .
It is called Sultana Street
In the past , it was a breathing space for the people of Medina .
It is very important because it has shopping malls , stores and restaurants .
The people of Medina come here on Wednesdays , Thursdays and Fridays .
But now , it has become unbearable and we ca n't go there even if we have our men with us .
So we have to make do with small restaurants and shops faraway from this street .
There are groups of youths on the sidewalks and as for their clothes , one feels too embarrassed to look .
I feel like their pants are about to drop as they 're so low down on the waist .
All they care about is finding women and harassing them .
Even a married woman walking with her children is not safe from their harassment .
I swear , some groups of young people set up teams to skate on the sidewalk and street and go between cars on what they call skateboards .
I blame the honorable Consultative Council .
The Consultative Council .. with its size ... and its great position .. even with the great position and quantity of knowledge of its members ..... left behind the most important education problems .. and focused on a subject some consider important , sensitive , and decisive in the educational process .... that is , introducing -LRB- the subject of physical education for girls -RRB- .
It left the problems of -LRB- transferring female teachers , their promotion , improving their level , appointing them in their districts , the problems of transportation and roads which face the expatriates among them , the road accidents which grieve us every day and in which we lose our dearest friends , etc. , and many other problems facing the education sector ..... -RRB-
I wish they had discussed the introduction of nutrition awareness and mental health subjects , so the girl would at least get to know herself , and to know how to deal with psychological problems , the most important of which are shyness and low self - confidence ?
Physical fitness for girls , is it useful ?
And what is its goal ?
The boys , and when they were boys ....... what did they benefit ... -LRB- bellies and chests , -RRB- thanks to Mr. Hamburger and .... Ms. Potatoes .
The problem is that the physical and psychological structure of the girl .. is different from the boy .. .. and she can not bear what a boy can bear .
Let me assure you of something .
A girl actually exercises .. all the time ... from her entry into school until she leaves it ...... without ... special gym and fitness classes ;
So shall we exhaust her tender body with another sport ?
Iraqi police sources said today , Monday , that a group of gunmen , whose members were wearing security forces uniforms and driving official cars , were able to steal one million US dollars in downtown Baghdad .
And a security source told the independent news agency Voices of Iraq that " Three new pick - up trucks , similar to the vehicles of the Iraqi security forces , driven by around 20 gunmen wearing National Guard uniforms , blocked two cars in Al - Sadoon street in downtown Baghdad . "
He added that " The two cars carried four employees of the Middle East Investment Bank who were carrying one million dollars . "
And he indicated that " The two cars were on their way to deposit the sum at the Iraqi Central Bank on Al - Rashid street in downtown Baghdad . "
And the source revealed that the gunmen " kidnapped the employees , took the million dollars , and the two cars and escaped to an unknown destination . "
And he said that " The employees work at the Al - Alawiyah branch of the Middle East Investment Bank , and it is a national bank . "
It is worth mentioning that Sadoon street , where the incident occurred , is in the center of the capital , Baghdad , and is considered one of the most important commercial streets of the city .
The street always has heavy traffic activity and has a number of Iraqi security forces checkpoints on it .
And what makes the security measures on Al - Sadoon street even more intense is Baghdad Hotel which is one of the important hotels in Baghdad .
It is located at the middle of Al - Sadoon street and has intensified security measures , such that it is surrounded by concrete walls , barbed wire , and dozens of security men .
Recently , Baghdad city witnessed two similar incidents .
One of them targeted one of the governmental Rafidain banks in Al - Amiriyah district in western Baghdad , when gunmen wearing Iraqi security forces uniforms again broke into the bank and stole the money that was there .
The second incident occurred in the high - class city of Al - Mansour last year when a group of gunmen blocked an official car carrying hundreds of thousands of dollars and seized it after killing a number of security men guarding the car .
Peace be upon you .
What I want to talk about in this topic is the increase in the price of everything without exception .
Is it theft or is it a genuine increase which is subject to the circumstances that caused the increase ?
Everything has doubled in price and no one is keeping an eye on it .
What 's strange is that when I asked someone why the price of agricultural materials has increased when most of it is produced locally , he answered me , " Visit the wholesale center and you 'll discover that those who are increasing the prices are a bunch of " tapeworms " who raise the prices without anyone keeping an eye on them " .
So where is the Ministry of Trade to give us the main reason for these increases in all goods ?
What is strange is that engine oil is priced but the real price is n't anything like it , I mean the company steals in broad daylight .
One of the oil sellers told me that the posted price is just a suggested retail price and not the real price and that you have to buy in bulk to get the real price .
So who is responsible for this ?
And how can any employee with a salary that 's barely enough to live on cope with these unjustified increases ?
So who is responsible ?
By the way , in order to protect its citizens , a neighboring state announces the price of merchandise daily over the radio or by printing the prices in one of the newspapers .
So what is the Ministry of Trade doing to protect us from traders ?
In spite of the crimes and atrocities that the United States is committing under the leadership of Bush , the number one terrorist in the world and his gang of Zionists , this hoodlum continues to insist that the world has become safer after all this destruction and killing of Muslims and the innocent everywhere .
It is obvious from reading about all these events that we find that the American pirate is looking for an exit from these successive defeats and from the blows that assail them from all directions .
The American giant and mighty colossus has become a frightened mouse thanks to the Islamic resistance in Afghanistan and Iraq , and through the cheap and superficial settlement of the Palestinian question with the participation of Abu Mazen Mirza and the Zionist entity in exchange for a calendar of promises that aim ultimately at the repression of the Palestinian resistance .
That is why Condoleezza Rice 's visit to Egypt , Saudi Arabia and the countries of the region comes at this time .
The carrier of firewood comes .
On her agenda is a set of proposals and directives supported by Israel , intended to offer some concessions , the most important of which is to choke and besiege the resistance in order to make the Zionist project , the so - called New or Greater Middle East , succeed , particularly after the American - Israeli fears resulting from the Israeli defeat in the latest war in Lebanon , and the rise in the stardom of the resistance which has become a popular heritage after we swallowed cups of humiliation and shame from America .
Thanks to this resistance , the balance of power has changed .
The birth of the New Middle East has faltered , and died before it was born with the mounting defeats in Afghanistan , Iraq , Lebanon and Somalia , and after that in Sudan and Iran , God willing .
Similarly , it is no accident that Rice 's visit to the region is timed to coincide with Egypt 's undertaking to convince the Sudanese government to accept the deployment of international forces in Darfur .
Matchstick .
I am sorry if I am bothering you , but I found your email on the blog , and I need you to relay my question to whoever can answer .
God 's will for me was that I was in an accident in Riyadh four months ago .
Thank God , I was not hurt .
When the security patrols arrived , the other party was held 100 % responsible for the accident .
The other party carried a card for insurance under the name Salamat Program .
After assessing the accident , the amount of compensation amount was set at 10,000 riyals .
From the date 7/25/2006 , and until this moment , I have been requesting this amount from the insurance company .
To this day , I have not seen one riyal .
I found nothing but procrastination and evasion .
Each day , they say call tomorrow , that is , if you find someone to answer your call .
The question ?
To which government authority should I file my complaint in order to get all that is my due without procrastination and evasion from the company ?
Should I complain to the Office of the Ombudsmen , or the Chambers of Commerce , or ,
I hope to find a solution through you , knowing that the company is called the United Group for Cooperative Insurance , and its headquarters is in Jeddah .
I thank anyone who tries to help me .
God grant us success .
Who in the construction company is robbing us ?
Who is developing Riyadh at our expense ?
Is the construction company a charitable company so that it should provide the Riyadh area with services at its own expense and without any economic feasibility ?
Does it make sense that a real estate company with a capital of one billion ca n't make 10 % of its capital ?
I mean , if you gave that sum to an uneducated Indian caretaker , he would make at least a 10 % profit from rentals .
Other real estate companies make at least 30 % a year from their capital .
These guys have set up a charity with our money or they 're sharing out the 20 % in an indirect way !!!
My God , it 's terrible that we should put our trust in thieves like these and I think we should stop keeping quiet and expose them ...
Do these thieves think we do n't know what they 're doing and how they 're stealing ? And who is robbing us behind our backs ?
We thought they would stop stealing and give us what we are due but it seems that they despise our ability to stop them and expose them ... but when we do , their pleading will be useless .
King Abdul Aziz , God rest his soul , was wise when he said do not combine government and trade !!
Choose either government or trade because combining the two sooner or later leads to the government being toppled and trade being unprofitable .
Four years ago , a Swiss university colleague invited me to give a presentation / lecture on Iraq ...
My colleague had been asked by an organization concerned with handicapped younth to prepare a cultural , entertaining , and educational program for this kind of audience ...
She had the idea of presenting fifteen countries as a representative sample of the continents and cultures of the world , and that individuals from those countries would present their countries ...
She asked me if I was willing to participate and present Iraq in this activity , so that she could add Iraq to the list of those countries ...
and I do not miss a chance to talk about Iraq ...
I accepted , but honestly , I was scared at the time in front of this kind of audience , which requires greater attention and effort from you ...
Part of the program was to bring in something to taste , from the country we were representing ... something to be eaten or drunk that the participants could taste , and so that the country could have tangible representation ...
Without hesitation , I gave a slide presentation using " Power Point " ...
and I chose , with a little hesitation , to make them Iraqi tea , Abu Al Hail tea .
The result was pleasing to the audience , who liked the taste of the Iraqi tea and the slide presentation approach ...
My colleague later told me that I was the only lecturer to use a picture presentation with " Power Point " slides , and that the audience had liked that a lot ...
I did not doubt the power of this program on the imagination of this kind of audience .
That is why I chose it ...
but I was afraid they would not like the taste of Abu Al Hail tea , which might be from another planet ...
But they liked it ...
a great surprise ...
This gave me joy more than their liking the " American " Power Point presentation .
I was not ready for another defeat by America and its " programs " ...
I was looking for , at the very least , a draw in this symbolic confrontation ...
At that time , the American siege was killing the children of Iraq , and I wanted to symbolically take revenge ...
A draw was a victory for Iraq ... for Abu Al Hail tea not to lose to Power Point ...
Just that it did not lose ... that was a victory .
I can not assume the personality a Lebanese , especially one from Hezbollah , but I will describe some of the daily features of the demonstrations .
The crowd mixture of demonstrations is made up of Shiite Lebanese and some Christian followers of Aoun .
Of course , we do not forget our Syrian brothers .
A demonstrator is paid the sum of twenty American dollars daily , equivalent to 75 riyals per day .
If we multiply that by 30 days , it would be equivalent to the salary of a Saudi employee in a phone kiosk , maybe more .
You do the math .
It is notable that the demonstrations came just in time to ruin the holiday season in Lebanon , especially in the area of central Beirut , known by the Saudis as Solidaire .
Investments in Solidaire are by Christians and Sunni Muslims .
There are no Shiite investments , neither in tourism nor in Solidaire .
Their investments are only in the mountain restaurants on the South .
Our Gulf brothers are afraid to eat in Shiite restaurants .
The timing of the July war came at the beginning of the tourist season .
Parking lots in Solidaire turned into camps .
The time of demonstrations came in winter , so the demonstrators needed heat .
They could only find wood in the public parks , which were totally ruined .
Lebanese people gather in the evening around water - pipes , and a majority of them smoke hashish .
Syrians line up with carts selling bread and eggs .
Look at the female demonstrators from Hezbollah .
They look like they are from an actress ' agency .
Imagine how the mercenary hashish - smoking demonstrators might bring down the government .
I will return , God willing , with the latest field reports , the subject is not political .
After the devastating and disgraceful failure whether at the world championship level or even at the continental championship level , like now in Doha in Asia , personally and on behalf of the female gender , I express to you , the young men of Saudi Arabia , our complete readiness as members of the female gender , to watch you bring about the defeat this time of Doha in Qatar .
And in any international forum , as you have accustomed us to , and in every challenge to human strength which attests to what the human body can achieve in its strength and precision , its patience and art . We are ready to pat you on the back and caress your shoulders , console you in your sadness , wipe the tears from your cheeks . And to recite the prayers of the old ladies asking the Creator to compensate you with better championships next time .
It has become the norm to receive Saudi youth empty - handed .
It has become the norm for you , the young men , not to raise the flag of monotheism among the flags of nations .
It has become the expected scenario that we only hear from you , young men , promises about the coming championships .
Because each championship is followed by another , there is no definite time as to how close the era of challenge is or the golden era when medallions are drawn on your chests , not in the near future nor even in eternity .
Despite all your failures we find you depriving us , the female gender , and in a discriminating way , of engaging in challenging the nations .
We find the public welfare -LRB- of youth -RRB- limiting its activity to a gender that confirms its failure not once and not even a thousand times .
Why not open the doors for girls to exercise their human rights , to confirm their freedom which was guaranteed by religion , law , and humanity , so they can stand tall holding the flag that says " There is no god except God , and Muhammad is the messenger of God " among the rest of the girls of the Asian continent ?
Parliament Member Mishaan Al - Jubouri , Head of the Reconciliation and Liberation Block , said that the political process has died and should be buried .
This came in an interview with one of the satellite channels .
He also described the current and previous governments as sectarian and exclusive governments that kill Sunnis and assist the militias in doing so .
He also described Al - Maliki as the most exclusive person , whose motto is murder , then murder , then murder , and he was responsible for the military office of the Shiite Dawa party , which is killing Sunnis .
He noted that Al - Maliki had told him , " Let the Sunnis go as refugees outside the country for 30 years and then let them come for us to reconcile with them . "
As for the reconciliation project that Al - Maliki has announced , Mishaan said this project has no basis in fact and that what Al - Maliki did was only to satisfy the Americans and trick certain politicians , and that his establishment of the Anbar Militias , who strive to kill the people of Anbar , is nothing but proof of this .
Mishaan Al - Jubouri accused Moqtada Al Sadr and his Mahdi Army militia of killing Sunnis and of being behind the Sadr city explosions , with help from an outside party , in reference to Iran .
He said that there was a committee of lawmakers in Brussels that was gathering evidence on the crimes of Moqtada Al Sadr and his militias .
It is worth noting that Mishaan Al - Jubouri 's immunity was withdrawn due to accusations of corruption from the Government Integrity Committee , and that the Reconciliation and Liberation Party which he chairs had withdrawn from the government .
Investigation : Atif Khalil
For over 10 years , Al - Wafd has conducted a press campaign against the importation of Canadian rapeseed oil after local and international scientific reports proved its great danger to public health .
Al - Wafd succeeded in getting the cultivation and importing of rapeseed oil banned after the case in its entirety was referred to parliament , and many authorities and relevant ministries intervened to ban the importation of rapeseed oil and the cultivation of the plant from which it is extracted .
Suddenly a few months ago , an Egyptian importer managed to import rapeseed oil after it was given another name , Canola , to mislead the Egyptians - people and government - and with this new name , rapeseed oil has entered Egypt once again and is sold in our shops .
People do n't realize how dangerous it is for public health as it can actually lead to death .
What does the government want from the Egyptian people ?
It has allowed deadly Canola oil -LRB- formerly known as rapeseed -RRB- into Egypt and into its markets ... does n't the government know how dangerous this Canadian oil is for the health of Egyptians ... has n't it read reports by the World Health Organization and institutions working in nutrition which have refused to use Canola as food for humans ?
Does n't the government care about the pledge to safeguard the welfare of the country and its citizens ?
And Canada , the biggest oil producer , wants to export its produce of this type to Egypt but does the Egyptian government know that Canada exports this type of oil to us but imports safer oils for its people , which proves that it only uses Canola oil to show its " authority " .
After a battle of over 30 years to prevent the entry of Canola oil into Egypt , are people weakening or have they lost their consciences for a fistful of dollars splattered with the blood and lives of Egyptians ?
The importation of this oil , which causes death because it affects the liver , pancreas , kidneys , heart , lungs , nerves , skin , bones , spleen and glands , is now allowed .
I was not expecting what happened on a live program on the Nur Dubai channel when the hosts hung up on a caller who was complaining about houses being flooded in Al - Rashidiya in Dubai .
The reason for the flooding was n't the rain that fell in the Emirates but rather because of water leaking out of the drains , as well as Dubai municipality 's emergency services not responding to calls .
Unfortunately the program 's hosts did n't give this lady a chance to finish what she was saying with " Bu Omar " attempting to justify the municipality 's position and defend them in a bizarre way that I would n't have expected from " Bu Omar " for whom I have immense respect and admiration because of his wonderful way of speaking .
My main criticism is not about hanging up on the caller because the program 's hosts know more about the circumstances and " warding off evil takes priority over seeking interest " .
The criticism of " Bu Omar " is that he allowed the Emirates and other areas to be criticized but not Dubai , even though the breakdown that happened in other areas because of the rain , also happened in Dubai , though to a lesser extent .
I hope " Bu Omar " does not take this approach again to avoid losing people 's faith in the program , which is seen as a refuge and breathing space for many people .
I ask God to grant success to the program 's hosts in fulfilling their mission .
Al - Khbeir , U.A.E.
American President George W. Bush is receiving Abd al - Aziz Baqir al - Hakim , the head of the so - called Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq , at the White House .
Welcome .
He rolls out the red carpet for him , Thanking him for accepting the invitation he sent him to meet with him .
He discusses with him the matter of the Iraqi quagmire that has submerged the United States of America , seeking his help to get him out of that morass . Knowing that the Council for the Islamic Revolution , which is headed by Abd al - Aziz Baqir al - Hakim , was one of the parties that suggested the invasion of Iraq to American President Bush .
That was when the Council was headed by his brother Muhammad Baqir al - Hakim , who was assassinated after the entry of the ugly American into Iraq .
So he is seeking his help now to get out of his predicament .
This is not the amusing paradox .
Rather , it is that Abd al - Aziz Baqir al - Hakim heads the armed Badr Militia that is fueling the sectarian conflict in Iraq and is accused of bloodshed and aggression -- the very terrorism that President Bush claims to be in a fierce war against .
He is welcomed and greeted at the American White House , to be used as a tool with which to fight the Shiite leader Muqtada al - Sadr , who stands against the presence of the Americans in Iraq , and against American President Bush himself , in order to finish him and the Al - Mahdi Army which he leads .
My brother Hamid , The decision to close down the group is basically up to you .
Maybe this decision will encourage some to create their own groups or participate more .
I do not know .
In all cases , the correspondence gave everyone including me the opportunity to communicate and learn about other different views .
In this respect , I am grateful for this effort .
I would like to know the primary goal that you perceived when you decided to proceed with this initiative .
Maybe then I can understand your decision to close it , if that is what you want , of course .
My view on this matter is that it has - the group - accomplished some sort of achievement .
The obvious negativity from some does not mean that you will not face negativity in life , in the community .
This is important .
In addition to the fear that some might have - from the security aspect - who are burdened with ideas rejecting the other , and maybe the desire to eliminate him and ca n't frankly and openly express their ideas to the extent that they desire .
This is understandable .
I previously informed those who want to participate in a blog I started , on -LRB- blogger -RRB- but got no response .
Later I learned that the blogger was blocked .
I hope this is the reason and not the intellectual guardianship or the spiral self - withdrawal :--LRB-
Despite my feeling for several times that you and I do not agree , I wish you prosperity and luck .
Greetings .
Next week , God willing , the water and electricity bills will start to be distributed in one bill .
The Minister of Water and Electricity will be available in the Saudi Company for Electricity -LRB- in the Kharis service area in the Roda district -RRB- to launch the start of distribution , after the implementation of the project is completed without any media fuss , in order to avoid public opinion , which causes a big fuss , refusing this merge .
The Saudi Channel started preparing for the issue two days ago and asked citizens about their opinion on consolidating the water and electricity bills .
The only reason for their merge is very , very silly ; namely , the designation of the Ministry of Water and Electricity by this name requires also a consolidated bill for water and electricity .
The fine for disconnecting the electricity meter and turning back the reading is ten riyals , and the fine for pilfering water is two hundred riyals .
Will the fine for pilfering water be consolidated with the electricity one to be ten riyals ?
Brother , what are the repercussions of these bills on a large section of citizens who can barely pay the electricity bill itself ?
Why should you care about the water and electricity bill ?
Did n't this minister see the women sitting in front of the entrance to Kharis Services with the electricity bills in their hands , pleading for the reviewers to help them pay them ?
The news is correct and 100 % confirmed , for correspondence .
The civil war -LRB- God Almighty protect us from it -RRB- is a catastrophe in the real sense .
We witnessed this in our sister country Lebanon in the seventies of the last century , and the result was too tragic for words .
The killing of thousands of Lebanese because of sectarianism , provincialism , and identity , the destruction of the infrastructure of the country , the immigration of thousands of them to foreign countries , hundreds of handicapped people , thousands of widows and orphans , the Lebanese currency -LRB- the Lira -RRB- reaching its lowest levels .
Today , in our injured Iraq , we hear from here and there those who play that tune and tell us every now and then that a civil war is going on , some have even started setting scenarios , possibilities , and results , as if it were imminent !!
First among those are our brothers the American stakeholders , who expected this , and more than one official made a statement about this catastrophe , headed by -LRB- Senior Officer -RRB- General - Abizaid -
The Commander of the American Central Command , which is supervising the American operations in Iraq , General John Abizaid , warned of the danger of the outbreak of civil war in Iraq if the sectarian violence continues .
He said in a hearing before the Armed Services Committee in the American Senate , " If that -LRB- the violence -RRB- does not stop , Iraq could drown in civil war . "
In the hearing sessions , members in the Senate inquired about the implications of a civil war for the more than 130,000 American troops that have been deployed in Iraq .
The American Defense Secretary responded , " I can not predict in this matter . "
" This could indicate that we believe this thing will happen , " he added , calling for patience .
New specializations for female students .
There are calls for more areas of specialization to be opened up for females students .
What are the fields you think need to be opened up to them rapidly ?
Female students need to specialize in the fields of education technology in all its branches .
This is not empty talk ; it is based on a study by the educational techniques in higher education team .
Computer graphic design , electronic , electrical , civil and industrial engineering , school buildings engineering , designing educational materials to upload to the internet , academic advice , family and marital relations experts and other areas needed by the market .
This is what market requirement studies have shown , conducted in order to delineate new specializations , whether for boys or girls .
You can refer to the Aafaaq website for a clearer , more accurate picture .
Do you back a single academic curriculum for male and female students ?
Or do you believe each side has their specific talents ?
I 'm for a single curriculum , apart from certain subjects such as home economics .
As for mathematics , and according to the latest child development and growth studies , and the difference between females and males , at the early stages , it 's preferable for information to be presented differently , but to be combined later on .
But I also back curricular decentralization in such a way that details , standards and motor , cognitive and social skills are defined and then specialist companies can come in and set up curricula according to the areas in question because the experiences and interests of town people differ from the skills of village people and so on .
I wish that the general management , represented by the Soccer Federation , would wake up and take a firm stand , and to put out the fire of sports and media anarchy caused by one team instead of disbanding the Referee Committee -LRB- the scapegoat as usual -RRB- .
After every game Al - Hilal plays , other teams pay the price in order to unjustly and artificially increase the number of championships for this team .
Leave the sedatives and eliminate the primary reasons that make referees sell their conscience in favor of Al - Hilal in the world of soccer .
There are only two major reasons that may make the referees favor one team over another .
The first one , unfortunately , might be the fear of Al - Hilal 's domineering , chaotic , immoral , and unpatriotic media , which is the reason for the intolerance and backwardness that we have in soccer .
Frankly , I find the utter silence from the general management and the ministry of information strange .
The second one might be that some of our soccer referees take bribes , God forbid .
About four years ago , the Referee Committee was disbanded after a match similar to yesterday 's game .
Referee Muhammad Al - Suwail was suspended for determining the result of the game in favor of Al - Hilal and canceling a clear penalty kick for Al - Nasr .
How similar is today to yesterday !
The refereeing mistakes that affect the outcome of local games all continue to be in favor of one team , namely Al - Hilal .
What did we get from disbanding the Referee Committee as long as the main reasons have not been removed ?
The mistakes are still the same and in favor of only one team .
It 's too bad about our money , our effort , and our support as long as the recent championships have been forcibly credited to this team .
None of you have true faith until you wish for your brother what you wish for yourself .
There was a young Saudi man who left for America to study English and reside there , in search of a homeland that would appreciate his talent .
This young man learned the language , I will call him by the name -LRB- Khaled -RRB- , but he is no Khaled .
Khaled settled down in America for ten years without coming back to his town in Saudi Arabia .
He got busy with work and lived in American society , until a missile company in one of the American states realized that this young man had a talent in atomic science .
He was appointed manager of a missile lathe company in America ; no missile would even leave this company without this young Saudi man 's signature .
One day , after ten years of his stay in America , coincidentally , one of the Saudi princes came to the state where this young man resided , and this prince asked for a translator for the doctors .
They told him that there was a Saudi young man in the same state who had mastered the English language , so he told them to bring him to translate for me what the doctors say .
This young man came and spent a month with the prince , translating for him while he stayed in the hospital .
One month after the prince 's arrival in America , he wrote a poem of longing for his people and homeland .
This young man thought to himself and said , I have been here in America for ten years , and I did not send one letter to my family .
I do not know anything about them .
This prince after only one month sent a poem of longing to his family .
So this young man , Khaled , decided to return back to his family and homeland .
When the company learned that this young man had decided to return to his homeland , unfortunately America fights every Arab talented mind , it made him a victim of heroin and alcohol until he went half crazy .
After that , they allowed him to return to his homeland .
Without an appointment , and without a meeting or prior knowledge , I found one of my writings published in a newspapers called Laila .
After skimming through this magazine , I realized that its editor - in - chief is a Lebanese Christian brother .
I browsed through its lines and decided to continue publishing all my writings on its pages .
Eventually , I was selected as one of its permanent writers .
I consider being among those brethren an honor for me or for any other writer .
I frankly tell you that it took over my heart and came to rest in it .
It is the most cherished newspaper among the many newspapers in which I publish .
But the obvious question is : why am I writing this article now ?
What is the occasion ?
Since last Ramadan , I have been receiving many e-mails asking why I publish in this magazine and inquiring why I insist on publishing in this newspaper , and the secret behind it .
The letters intensified and became varied in how they flung sermons and religious images that have recently emerged , which are an organized campaign aimed at social unification and ripping apart the physical Arab structure of Muslims and Christians ; where we live together in unity and solidarity in the Arab World and abroad .
Neither Arab countries nor our relationship with one another has made distinctions among the one people , and the sectarian , religious fanaticism has not attacked us .
We united and never inquired : are you a Christian or a Muslim ?
That is what has materialized in effect in Lebanon , Palestine , Egypt , and the rest of the Arab countries .
As for the owners of those poisoned pens and cloned minds who are trying to destroy our social unity , it is the result of colonization and globalization spreading its malignant poisons to continue this conspiracy against everything that is Arabic .
Al Dhari , the secretary - general of the Muslim Scholars League , and the President of the Green Zone Republic , Al Talabani accused Sheikh Harith of being interested only in igniting nationalist -LRB- i.e. , Arab - Kurdish -RRB- and sectarian -LRB- i.e. , Sunni - Shiite , of course -RRB- feuds .
For such an accusation to come from the Green Zone at Sheikh Harith is no strange matter , but for it to come from the President of the Republic of Iraq - this is indeed strange and objectionable .
Since Talabani came to prominence at the head of a group of youths who split from Mullah Mustafa Barzani , he has been part of all the unrest that Iraq and the Kurds have been subject to .
From the Baath government in Baghdad to Iran , from Syria to Turkey , from London to Washington , Talabani has not left any party with interests or concerns in Iraq and its affairs without working with them , on one level or another .
Up to the time that his statement was released , he was working to create a rift among the ranks of the Kurdish movement and disputes between them , implicating the Kurds in a series of failed armed skirmishes against the central government -LRB- some of which did not fail to serve the interests of foreign forces -RRB- , in starting a destructive Kurdish civil war in the nineties , then getting involved in the plan to invade and occupy Iraq , which has brought the country to the state of hell , destruction and death it finds itself in .
Our banks used to be and still are the most profitable in the world .
Because the people are Muslims and do not accept interest from their bank accounts , this interest goes to the banks .
After I read some bank publications about its outrageous profits in the billions of dollars , mostly from loans with exorbitant interest rates with which they controlled the citizens ' salaries for many years to come , I am prompted to ask : Have you ever seen a charitable hospital for the citizens built by one of these banks ?
Have you seen a road or a street or a bridge or a dam built at the expense of a bank ?
Have you seen a school or a university built at the expense of a bank ?
Have you seen a mass marriage ceremony at the expense of a bank ?
Have you seen an interest - free loan to help a young man get married , or study , or work coming from a bank ?
Have you heard about treatment of a citizen at the expense of a bank ?
Have you heard about awareness programs against corruption and drugs , support for the Ministry of Interior , and donations to eliminate them ?
All we have seen from the exploiters of the people is -LRB- Jewish interest loans -RRB and control of citizens ' salaries for many years to come .
We have heard nothing about their donations except for -LRB- a mosque and a facility to wash the dead -RRB- donated by -LRB- al - Rajihi -RRB- out of the thousands of millions that he possesses in most cities .
We say , " May God reward him . "
He is the best of the worst when it comes to donations .
But mosques are everywhere and there is no shortage .
The state has been and still is building mosques , but the nation needs to build hospitals , and to donate medicines and equipment , such as dialysis and heart equipment .
The nation needs to build universities and schools , construct roads , help the unemployed , widows , orphans , and divorcees , rehabilitate and assist the handicapped , and eliminate unemployment , spinsterhood , drugs and corruption .
You owners of banks , may God take away his blessings from you ...
How much have you profited and consumed from this nation ?
How often have you been ungrateful , criticized , done injustice , and afflicted misery on this nation and its people ?
The price of vegetables in the kingdom 's markets suddenly rose twofold or more this week .
Greengrocers attributed the rise in price to exports to Gulf states in order to achieve doubled and quick profits , in addition to the start of the Hajj season .
Al - Riyadh 's tour of the market to discover the reasons for this found a 36,000 Riyal deficit .
Attiyatulla Salim , a greengrocer in the northern market for greengrocery , complained of the price increase of vegetables by a number of farm owners and traders .
The price of a large box of zucchini is now between 100 and 120 Riyals whereas the price of a box of zucchini in the past was no more than 45 Riyals .
He pointed out his customers ' annoyance at the price rise , which happened a week ago and which has had a great effect on customers visiting the fruit and vegetable market .
Salim said that he had suffered a shortfall of 36,000 Riyals in the course of just one week as a result of the lack of customers buying vegetables following the price increase , in addition to having to pay out 100 Riyals in daily wages to five Saudi workers and 100 to foreign workers who carry the goods and are employed by the company which manages the market .
In the summer of 2006 , Hezbollah forces crossed over and abducted two Israeli soldiers and killed a few others in the same way that the Hamas movement did unexpectedly a few days before Hezbollah did the same .
What was the outcome ??
The Israeli forces responded inhumanely and viciously against south Lebanon , which led to the death of hundreds of people , families and dreams .
There is no question that Israel is to blame for these massacres and should be condemned and punished .
-LRB- This of course will not happen now -RRB- .
But at the same time , politics is harsh .
Politics unfortunately is not based on principles and idealism but on reality .
When you are in a zoo , you do not find the lions roaming freely , rather they are chained inside cages because lions understand only their instincts .
Unfortunately politics is a breeding ground for human monsters .
What if we assumed that Hezbollah 's intention in abducting the two Israeli soldiers was in response to the Israeli oppression that we all see ?
Is n't authority or power a responsibility ?
What I want to say is that someone working in politics should not be condemned for his idealism and slogan , but by how connected he is to reality and his ability to understand it , and thus concluding what the consequences of his decisions and actions would be .
This is what Hezbollah failed to do .
Yes .
Without doubt , Israel was not able to defeat Hezbollah militarily , and it suffered many losses , but what were Lebanon 's gains ?
Today will be the announcement of the first five female elected university students , who will form the first student council to represent female students through student elections .
These are considered the first of their kind in Saudi universities and were initiated by Prince Mohamed Bin Fahd University through the department responsible for student activity in the female student department in the university .
The winning female students won after they had gone through a competition of 16 nominated female students , based on the percentages they received in elections to represent their female student colleagues in the council .
The female students who were elected will form a student council to represent female students .
It will be run in a totally separate and independent way from what occurs in the female student university campus and will convey their desires to the faculty council and the university council .
This council will also be the voice of female students , expressing their desires and aspirations , in presenting ideas aimed at acquiring skills and talents to graduate a generation that is capable of bearing responsibility .
Mona Al Nakhilan , Public Relations Manager in the Female Student Department , said that the experiment , which is considered the first of its kind in Saudi universities , represents an opportunity for university female students to express their opinions and shape their characters , noting that the elections took the acknowledged form of general elections and that the elected female student could deliver her opinions and convey her colleagues ' ideas to the university administration in the framework of religion and acknowledged traditions .
She noted that , after the return from Eid Al Adha vacation , each elected female student will present her own official plan and every nominated female student from among the 16 female nominees experienced for over two weeks , the period of the election phases , an election atmosphere for the first time .
The university administration in the Female Student Department was able to vote for the candidates through female employees among the female faculty members and female administrative employees .
The Arab peninsula is characterized by a great deal of tribal variety and each of these tribes has its own way of receiving guests and preparing feasts .
It might resemble some other tribes or be unique to them and some brothers may be surprised , especially local residents attending feasts , particularly if it is in their ' stronghold ' , i.e. the area they live in .
Among these customs , some of which we have seen and some of which we have heard about , I 'll describe a few and I look forward to people expressing their opinions to enrich the subject so that we can all learn about these customs .
For example , some tribes will only eat after the guest has eaten and will only finish after he finishes , even if he stays for a full hour .
Some get angry if the slaughtered animal which they have been honored with contains certain parts such as the neck , for example , or that you eat the tongue of the slaughtered animal .
Some will offer you food then leave you and your family to eat alone .
Some will turn off the lights so that you feel more comfortable when eating your food and so that you do n't feel as if someone is watching you , in addition to many other customs .
And perhaps there are even stranger customs other than the ones mentioned when you send in your comments on the subject .
So see you .
No one who followed the tyrant and his assistants ' trial session for the Anfal crimes of 12/06/2006 can deny the role of the testimony that Dr. Faek Mohammed Kolbi gave .
As an eyewitness , he recounted real events as a doctor who practiced his humanitarian and national role in treating victims of chemical weapons , especially as he performed his role well in listing details .
But as a chairman of a political party in Kurdistan who has a history of resistance in the Kurdish liberation movement , he should have called things by their real names and avoided the barren justification that previous plaintiffs and witnesses used when they mentioned the role of merchants of war , agents of the former regime who are called the leaders of the Kurdish clans , or consultants as the former dictator authority called them .
The least that could be said about those hireling criminals is that they are despicable mercenaries , for the crimes they committed that can not be justified under any circumstance .
The scale of their crimes is not less than the crimes of the tyrant and his bloodthirsty cousin , Chemical Ali .
The right place for those mercenaries is beside their humiliated master in the defendant 's cage .
We find that most of the witnesses , especially with the unqualified translators that the court has appointed , who many times distorted the witnesses ' testimonies in favor of those mercenaries as when they called them consultants of the national defense forces according to what the regime calls them .
Naming those criminals and their followers as national defense regiments can not be justified .
This is enough to annul the accusations against the plaintiffs in the Anfal case , a mass annihilation .
How could troops , whose duty was to defend the nation , burn the nation , annihilate its people with chemical weapons , and bury them alive in mass graves ?
Abbas ' decision to hold presidential and parliamentary elections is the last attempt in a series of many plots to derail the Islamists ' power - sharing in Palestinian territories .
Unfortunately , these attempts are backed by the Arabs and internationally ... with local instigation , help and execution by Abbas and the Fatah movement ... which has found itself outside the game ... after the Palestinian people had their say in the last elections .
Abbas and his group and his supporters abroad were gambling on the timing of Hamas ' fall ... through the economic and political blockade imposed on it ...
But Hamas has managed to come through its first difficult days in power ... and has managed to establish its presence through its continued and sincere work in spite of circumstances that were enough to bring down any other government .
As time passed , they felt that time was not on their side ... and that , as time passed , Hamas and its project and proposals were becoming deeply rooted in the Palestinian and Arab political and social reality ... especially after the recent successful tour by Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniya to a number of Arab and Muslim countries .
Therefore , these parties have realized that the time has come to throw in the final card in a series of plots and treachery ... by means of a coup against Hamas through a call for elections .
Abbas and his group are facing Hamas because it has succeeded ... if it had failed or if it was expected to fail ... they would have left it until it completed its lawful term ... in order to abort its legitimacy ... its project ... and its popularity in the Palestinian arena .
Its success strips them bare and shows their real size ... and brings down their proposals and projects .
Some Arabs want to topple Hamas because it is the first government formed by elected Islamists ... and this threatens the mummified Arab governments ... these relics that have been here for dozens of years !
In spite of their failure ... and lack of popular legitimacy .
For more than 10 years , I have been going to happy Yemen on most of my vacations , for what you find of cheap prices , beauty , conservatism , generosity , and the undamaged nature of its people there , though the services are still poor , but they have started to improve .
I go to Yemen more than once a year .
In order for the brothers to benefit religiously from their visits to Yemen , I invite them to visit the Quranic houses which are spread through all the provinces and include thousands of students spending their time with the Holy Quran .
These houses are spreading and their students increase in number during summertime .
There are things there that please the mind and open the heart .
Also , visiting the charity associations that are active in the programs they provide , like the Islah Association , Tiba Charity Foundation , and others .
What also distinguishes Yemen is the diversity of cultures .
In every district , you find something that distinguishes it from the other .
It has enough historic places and ancient civilizations to encourage visits to it , like the Throne of Bilqees and the Marib Dam .
It has coastal areas and beaches that are not found elsewhere , like the beaches of Al Makla , Aden and Al Khokha .
It is worth visiting and getting to know all of these places .
And visiting Yemen does not cost you much .
How Should We Care for Our Skin Day - to - Day ?
Amy
Who does n't want soft , white skin ?
But in real life our skin often gives us a hard time .
If it 's not darkness or redness in the face , it 's dull and pallid .
What can we do ?
Appropriately adjusting our diet could bring great improvements for our skin .
Whatever is the problem with your skin , you should prescribe " vegetables " based on your symptom .
Red face : this is caused by absorbing too much animal fat or protein .
The way to treat this is : when we eat foods containing animal fat or protein , we must supplement it with vegetables that contain plenty of chlorophyll , like spinach , celery or lettuce .
If we eat them raw , the effect is better .
We can also chop vegetables into tiny bits , wrap them in cloth , squeeze the juice and drink it .
Flushed face : the reason is poor circulation of blood , particularly a lack of blood flow to the epithelial cells .
When the weather is cold , people 's faces go red , particularly the tips of their noses .
The way to treat this is : 1. Frequently bathe and massage to make the blood flow freely .
Massage the red parts more .
2. To make the body fully absorb proteins better , we should eat plenty of food containing vitamin B1 and vitamin C .
We can improve our absorption of vitamin D by exposure to sunlight .
Oily dark face : this is caused by consuming too many animal oils and vegetable oils .
The way to treat this is : control the amount of animal and vegetable oils we consume and eat more vegetables containing chlorophyll .
Before we eat , we should drink a glass of vegetable juice diluted with warm boiled water .
The effect will be better .
Dark face : generally speaking , the skin of people who consume too much salt is rough and dark .
After exposure to the sun it is even worse .
The hands and feet going black is caused by the salt in the body needing to be flushed out through the extremities .
If we consume too much salt , our face will gradually be covered with a layer of dark skin .
The way to treat this is : 1. control our intake of salt , drink plenty of water to flush out the salt through our urine .
2. Bathing frequently , and soaking in the bathroom until you sweat , can also help to flush out some salt .
Freckles on the face : consuming too much salt may cause freckles to appear on the face .
And if in our diet we only absorb animal fats and protein , this will affect the normal functioning of liver and make the freckles more visible .
So those with freckles must eat plenty of fruit and vegetables .
As well as this , medicine is the great enemy of the skin .
Sedatives in particular will make the body produce too much acid .
The hormones will become unbalanced and freckles will appear on the face .

I am grateful to the University of Science and Technology

Topic : I am grateful to the University of Science and Technology
Posting station : BBS Unnamed space station -LRB- Tue Jan 2 12:18:26 2007 -RRB- , Forward .
Everybody has their own reasons for choosing a university ; because the cost of living in Hefei is cheaper , and I did n't want my parents to spend all their money , I chose the University of Science and Technology of China .
Years later , looking back on this choice , I certainly do not have any regrets .
Perhaps if I 'd chosen two schools in Beijing , I would n't be here today talking about how USTC is .
But USTC at the time was weak ; considering location , expenses , promotion and connections , USTC 's greatest wealth was its students .
If we had n't come forward and done something for USTC , it would have been finished .
This is also the main reason USTC students banded together .
Because I chose science and technology as my career , I am grateful to USTC for teaching me many things , and I am grateful to the reputation established by the previous president of the university , who enabled those who came after to benefit from it .
Precisely because I feel this gratitude , I want to repay USTC .
I regularly do my job properly and do not let USTC lose face .
I want to save money out of my meager fellowship to help a poor university student with his living expenses for four years .
I want to go back to China to make my contributions ; I also want to provide the needed help to future students of my university .
When I see people attacking USTC , I sometimes want to take the time to defend it , even though that may not help much .
Those USTC haters have their own reasons ; I do n't intend to change their thinking .
But with China 's universities being so backward , what contributions have these naysayers really made to their alma maters and their country ?
Like gaddy , for example , who first badmouths USTC students for not wanting to contribute money , says he himself has some money , and then wants to spend money filing a lawsuit because of a dispute over personal feelings on the bbs .
This hater really has some problems of his own .
After graduating , I will go back ; no matter where I work , I 'm still a USTC student , and I have no regrets about USTC and no regrets about my country .

I am also a USTC student , but everybody has studied abroad ; there 's no need to divide up into groups and quarrel all the time .
Chinese people love to beat up on Chinese people .
I love USTC , I love China .

[] What Expensive Registration Fees
[] <POSTER> fishingdays
[fishingdays] An academic conference that matches my research direction well is soliciting proposals and is scheduled for summer in China .
[fishingdays] I browsed their website , my god !
[fishingdays] The registration fees are sky high , and together with air and accommodation , over USD$ 4,000 is payable in total --
[fishingdays] This is purely profit seeking , and seeking unreasonably high profit , is n't it ?
[fishingdays] Can I be reimbursed when they become examination questions later ?
[fishingdays] No matter how interesting and valuable the conference is , I 'm not going to attend one that is so expensive .

[handldk] Is the conference domestic or international ?
[handldk] If it is international , everybody pays one single price .
The only thing is some international organizations give discounts to people from developing countries , and you may be able to pay less .
[handldk] I attended a conference in China last time -LRB- an international conference -RRB- .
The normal registration fees were nearly $ 1000 , excluding transportation and accommodation , and the lunches were awful .
[handldk] But later we had an evening banquet at the Great Hall of the People , where the dishes were really rare in restaurants outside -LRB- as I 'm quite gluttonous , I 've eaten quite a lot of foods -RRB- .
There were also gifts , quite worth it ! .
[handldk] I was at the conference for a week , and the total expense -LRB- food and accommodation -RRB- was $ 2000 .
[handldk] In your case , could $ 3000 be acceptable if $ 1000 is allowed for the air ticket ?

Another Business Trip to San Jose
Michael Zhou
Next week , I will go to San Jose for a three - day business trip .
I have no choice but to go .
My wife will have a hard time again at home .
We plan to make dumplings and steamed buns on weekend to be used as food reserve for next week .
On this trip to California , I plan to pay a visit to my Cisco colleagues and friends .
They all moved to California from RTP for different reasons .
It 's so hard to make a hotel reservation .
I do n't know whether it is because of an upcoming big conference , all hotels in the 10 - mile radius from San Jose have been booked up .
I could only find a Sheraton in Pleasant about 25 miles from the company .
I must make sure to bring my own GPS before I set out in case there is no GPS in the rental car .
[] I Strongly Suggest -LRB- the Tactic of Using Yao Ming in the Second Half -RRB- .
[] <POSTER> lightblue
[lightblue] Yao Ming and McGrady are two major sharp weapons of the Rockets .
The key is how they are used , instead of being compared blindly .
[lightblue] Neither those hating Yao nor those loving Yao make any sense .
[lightblue] One is a center and the other is a point guard , which are totally not comparable .
[lightblue] As for who contributes more to the team , it mainly depends on who the opponents are and which set of tactics the whole team play .
[lightblue] Yao Ming and McGrady are both treasures to the team of the Rockets .
It hinges primarily on how they are used , just like the fighter and the bomber in the air force , where it all depends on what battle is fight and with whom .
[lightblue] It is my belief that the Rockets can not just have one set of tactics , for example only revolving around Yao Ming or revolving around McGrady when they play .
[lightblue] You have to see what type of team your opponents are , how strong their center is and how strong they are outside , before you decide whether to play Yao Ming or McGrady , or half Yao Ming and half McGrady .
[lightblue] It now proves that other players of the Rockets are not weak , in which case it is not necessary to let Yao Ming play too much .
Simply let him get a good rest in the first two quarters and allow the shooters to score .
[lightblue] One characteristic of spot - up shooters is that they tend to become less precise as the match goes on .
At this time , an energetic Yao Ming should be released to score in the paint nine chances out of ten .
[lightblue] The opponents will also certainly be less precise outside in the second half and they can not match Yao Ming in the paint .
Would n't the Rockets secure victory this way ?
[lightblue] Thus , I strongly suggest -LRB- the Tactic of using Yao Ming in the second half -RRB- .

[springbull] Alas
[springbull] How sorry I am for JVG .
[lightblue] The Rockets complete with Yao and McGrady is a hot candidate for the championship .
I am not the first to propose it .
[lightblue] The key is both are there .
[lightblue] I also put forward the tactic of " using Yao in the second half . "
This might change Van Gundy 's past practice of always asking Yao Ming to try his best in the first quarter when both Yao and McGrady were there .
[lightblue] In the final and fourth quarter when scores in the paint are most needed , each time Yao Ming has weaker ability and more faults .

After Taiwan achieved democracy , hundreds of thousands of people turned out in the streets repeatedly to demonstrate .
Since Iraq achieved democracy , the situation has bordered on civil war .
China 's population is many times theirs , and our average educational level is lower than theirs .
If we blindly pursue so - called democracy that is not in keeping with the times , what happened in Taiwan and Iraq will certainly be many times worse here -LRB- as a multiple of the population -RRB- .
China could certainly fall into a situation of rule by gangsters or religious forces , or civil war .
When that happens , the chaos of the Cultural Revolution will pale by comparison , and it will be too late to cry .
Then there will be no need for America and Japan to attack us , we 'll be too busy fighting each other .
We wo n't need to be concerned with Taiwan ; even the Northeast will be independent .
Let 's say it again : it suits the interests of the West for China to become a disunited country with no production capacity and no fighting ability .
But so - called democracy is just a talking point ; some people take democracy as the ultimate form of morality , cloaking themselves in democracy in order to buy contraband .
Promoting democracy at least sounds better than promoting China 's return to a feudal empire or primitive society .

I answer frequently asked questions only once ; excuse me if I am unable to answer each similar question individually .
This question is very easy to answer ; that is , the meaning of these leaders ' democracy is not the same as the democracy of those who are anti-Chinese .
The leaders ' democracy is the democratic dictatorship of the people ; this has basically already been achieved , or is being achieved .
Because of cognitive issues , some people may feel they have been cheated .
Do not misunderstand me ; I support democracy .
But I support democracy in keeping with the times .
That is , a primitive society has the democracy of a primitive society ; a slave society has the democracy of a slave society ; a society in the early stages of socialism has a democracy suitable for the elementary stages of socialism .
Changes may occur in basic concepts of mathematics and physics because of new discoveries ; does the substance of democracy really remain unchanged for thousands of years ?
In other words , in the appropriate period , and for the appropriate groups , the appropriate democracy needs to be implemented .
That is my view of democracy .
【 Mentioned in the works of Wang2004 -LRB- Welcome everyone to BBS.Nlone.net -RRB- : 】 .

This fault , in a word , is that it lacks democracy .
The Chinese : people have an extraordinary need for democracy ; because only with democracy can the War of Resistance be strong : only then can Chinese internal and external relations : get on track , only then can we win the War of Resistance , only then can we build a good China , and only with democracy can we get China to continue : its unity after the war .

ZT Discount Stamps and Sheetlets : Where Do They Come From ? Where Do They Go ?
Discount stamps are sets and sheetlets of stamps that are currently discounted .
This is the biggest category of stamps .
It has a large number , great variety , and large face value .
That is , it 's a big category .
Precisely how big it is , I 'm afraid no - one knows .
Because this category has an objective existence , no - one can ignore it .
Its trends are extremely important .
It is the biggest category for collectors and has the largest influence on the stamp market .
When it rises , this indicates that stamps are gaining as a whole .
Its strength and weakness is the barometer of postal policy , the thermometer for the temperature of the market .
If there is no comprehensive rise and gains at the bottom in the category of discount stamps , then any upsurge is a castle in the air , the moon in the water .
Its foundations will not be solid .
Only when this category is handled well can the stamp market have any hope of surging up out of its slump and heading for a beautiful future .
Where do discount sheets come from ?
●The postal service sells them at a discount : a few years ago the postal service sold large quantities of stamps at low prices , violating pricing rules and stamp collecting rules .
It dumped discount stamps onto the stamp market on a large scale , making 50 - yuan sheets , 8 - yuan sheets and 5 - yuan sheets fall far below their own face value and the discounting of stamp sets even deeper .
This is the first source .
●Stamp collectors cashing out : the number of stamp collectors in our country reached a peak in 1997 .
According to estimates , there were approximately more than 27 million stamp collectors at that time .
To meet the stamp collecting demand from the great numbers of philatelists , the postal administration printed large numbers of stamp sets and sheetlets , based on the number of people who ordered stamps at that time .
In the last few years , for a variety of reasons , a large number of stamp collectors have been lost and no longer collect stamps .
In order to cash out , these people dumped the 1992 - 2005 stamps that they had collected onto the market in large volumes , causing supply to exceed demand .
This is the second source .
● Sell - offs by big collectors : in the stamp speculation in 1997 , quite a few large collectors having financial resources also bought back their stamp sheets from this period as short - term investments .
Now in order to cash out , they are also dumping them on the markets at a loss .
This is the third source .
● Underused : these stamps have been underused over the past few years , forming a large reserve in the market .
When the stamps were at their most discounted , a 50 - yuan sheetlet was 10 yuan , about 80 % off ; an 8 - yuan sheetlet was 2.4 yuan , about 70 % off ; and a 5 - yuan sheetlet was 1.8 yuan , about 64 % off .
The discounts were even deeper on stamp sets , though they might not be sold even at these discounts .
This is the fourth source .
● Oversupply of new stamps : it is well known that for many years the number of new stamps released has been very large .
Everyone knows this , so there is no need to make further comment .
This is the fifth source .
Over the last ten - plus years , discounted sheets of stamps have been like ghosts , floating back and forth in the airspace over the stamp market , and among stamp dealers .
They are traded back and forth , but never disappear .
They are such an inexplicable embarrassment .
But to take a materialist view of them , their existence is a fact , and we should be sure not to ignore them .
And if we ask how to get rid of discount stamps ?
Some say that those who make a mess should clean it up .
I think that wherever they came from , that 's where they should go back to .
■ Use them up : public service departments should make serving the people their highest aim .
They should address all the issues raised by NPC Deputy Yang Xianlong in his proposal concerning stamps , and should act in good faith in their work .
Good policies and good approaches will certainly bring good results and good returns .
The difficulty of using stamps for the general public is a major sticking point .
For historical reasons , the discounting of stamps has been widespread , with deep discount rates and long duration .
If these stamps are not permitted to be used , this is sure to harm the interests of the owners of the stamps ; if they are permitted to be used , then there will be a certain effect on the current revenues of the postal service .
It seems to be a contradiction not easy to resolve .
In fact , the newly - established China Post Group only needs to consider the big picture , to think about the future , to increase the rate at which stamps are used .
To further improve the postal reforms , the State Post Bureau should improve its supervision of postal services .
CPG should operate under supervision , and there should be no more violation of regulations .
This is the first way to get rid of them .
■ Collect them all : first , increase the number of stamp collectors by encouraging new people to join in stamp collecting .
Second , at all levels , all over the country , organize specific philatelic events that are conducive to a healthy body and mind and conducive to improving people 's temperament .
Third , increase guidance to stamp collectors ' associations in their work .
Fourth , promote philatelic culture on all fronts , bring stamp collecting events into schools , into villages , into factories , into army bases , into residential communities , and into the homes of millions .
If old friends return and new people also join in , and the number of stamp collectors again reaches 15 million or more , then we are honestly a little doubtful whether these few stamps will be enough for everyone to share .
If there are n't enough for everyone to share , then the price of stamps will naturally rise .
This would then naturally solve the problem of discounted stamps .
This is the second way to get rid of them .
■Buy them back : there are two buy - back methods : one is a policy buy - back , which is the postal service dealing with discount stamps -LRB- at least important stamps -RRB- with a state buy - back .
At present this seems to be rather difficult .
Second is a market buy - back , using the lever of market economy .
This takes the stamps bought at bottom discount rates on the market and sells them again to the public to use on correspondence , speeding up the use of discount stamps .
This involves the restructured postal administration taking part in market operations , reducing the pressure of discount stamps .
After a period of operation , this problem can be solved very effectively .
This approach can be considered quite a realistic method .
This is the third way to get rid of them .
■Controlling the source : first is that you absolutely can not think that because the price of stamps is heading back towards their value , because the price has risen a little , another opportunity for dumping stamps at low prices has come , and again start playing tricks with overprints .
This is the limit of good faith , you absolutely must not , oh , this is a must .
From the facts that this year 's year stamps are not being discounted , and the rate of discount on discounted stamps in the market has reduced significantly , it is enough to show that the postal policies are already starting to have an effect .
Only in this way will the numbers of stamps on the market start to decrease , and stamps move onto a healthy path of appreciation .
When stamps have risen in value to a certain degree , even if you ask someone to , he wo n't use stamps that are worth more than their face value as postage .
The more stamps appreciate , the fewer stamps will surely be used as postage .
This reasoning is obvious .
Second is using the scientific approach to development to decide the quantities of stamps distributed .
When the quantity of stamps distributed is large or too great , the practice of stamp collecting is damaged .
The number of stamp collectors is then greatly reduced .
This has been proved by past events .
The quantities distributed of new stamps must be appropriate for the actual situation .
Too many is no good ; too few is no good either .
This is the fourth way to get rid of them .
The destiny of discount stamps is : they came gradually , they 'll go gradually , and despite everything we 'll redouble our speed .
Is Blast Demolition Implementation of the Scientific View of Development ?

Is Blast Demolition Implementation of the Scientific View of Development ?
Wenhai .
While I was watching a TV channel , I heard from its news , " the tallest building beside the West Lake in Hangzhou was blast demolished only 14 years after completion , because it ruined the West Lake views . "
It is said blasting this " image project " reflects " the scientific view of development " of this Hangzhou government .
It is unbelievable to see the report associate the blast demolition with the scientific view of development .
The high riser has only been used for 14 years .
What does it mean by 14 years ?
If some messy buildings are left undecorated after six years of completion , I think it is not inappropriate at all to describe 14 years as " brand new . "
It took such a great fortune to build a high riser like this , and now it is blasted at an order .
How wasteful it is in ordinary people 's eyes .
I will never ever believe everyone in Hangzhou has a place to live in without any impoverished households .
If such a great fortune was from government appropriation , how many tax payers were needed ?
If it was invested by some business person , how many machines were needed to run and how many workers were needed to be busy ?
How many people can receive education and healthcare , among other things , with such a great fortune ?
What is the scientific view of development ?
The core is putting people first .
The scientific view of development will never waste resources at will , or let people bleed and toil in vain .
The scientific view of development emphasizes a conservation - minded society .
The scientific view of development focuses on urban planning .
Maybe some people say this tall building has ruined the West Lake views , and now we have attached importance to the scientific view of development .
I would say please wait .
If Hangzhou has only this one " image project , " the blast of which could restore its original state , it can be barely regarded as " scientific development . "
The problem is whether it will work ?
Hangzhou belongs to people of the entire nation .
So many Chinese have been to Hangzhou .
The Leifeng Tower was fallen down for years , which also symbolized the emancipation of Chinese women , but later on a lot of money was invested to build a fake tower standing beside the West Lake .
A tour guide said : " people often went up to explore the relics before it was built , but they have become reluctant to go up after it was built . "
This affects the West Lake , reducing tourists at the scenic spot .
Should we also push over the fake Leifeng Tower ?
Even if it were pushed over , would things go back to " people going up to explore relics ? "
Thus , blasting the high riser can not be associated with the scientific view of development .
When it was first built , it was for image in spite of public objections .
Some netizens even said it was for political feats , dining out , going on inspection tours , contract awarding , and various other benefits .
If the construction was for image , then the scientific view of development should never be the excuse for its blast demolition .
If it is really designed to implement the scientific view of development , then simply erect a plate at the " fake Leifeng Tower , " which indicates " who " managed the construction of the fake tower .
I guarantee there will be tourists exploring relics .

Topic : -LSB- CJPT -RSB- Roach : Risk Capital Will Be the Next Bubble .
Posting station : BBS Unnamed space station -LRB- Mon Jan 22 21:09:59 2007 -RRB- , Dump .
□ Morgan Stanley 's leading economist , Stephen Roach .
Several major lessons of 2006 rather reasonably explain the main developing trends in last year 's markets , namely that the current situation in the financial markets embodies the effects of all these developments interacting with one another .
In particular , in an era of excess current capital , risk capital high - income company bonds , structural credit products , emerging market securities and even staple commodities will be the next bubble .
Global rebalancing .
This is a topic that I have spent much of the last five years trying to get people to be concerned about .
To put it simply , the rebalancing theory holds that if the gap between countries with trade surpluses and deficits continues to expand , it will harm the sustained growth of the world 's economy .
In the last two years , regular account deficits in the U.S. averaged more than 800 billion dollars annually ; the U.S. accepted nearly 70 % of the earned surplus reserve of the world 's other countries , the equivalent of needing to bring in some 35 billion dollars per average business day in outside financial burden .
In a nutshell , the rebalancing plan the world so urgently needs is nothing more than a thorough reshaping of the global savings mix - that is , an improvement in the U.S. savings rate , which has been stagnant for a long time , and a lessening of excessive savings in other countries -LRB- especially in Asia and the Middle East -RRB- .
If the world 's savings mix does not change , the rebalancing theory holds that the situation will be very harmful to outside financing in deficit economic systems .
As for the United States , this will augur low exchange rates for the U.S. dollar , and an expansion of effective interest rates on U.S. - dollar capital .
But this did not happen in 2006 .
Although as the end of the year approached the U.S. dollar dropped somewhat , and effective interest rates continued to climb , this movement was still very far from the radical adjustments predicted by the framework of the rebalancing theory .
This phenomenon has two possible explanations : one is that other factors cropped up and intervened ; the other is that the theory basically does not stand up .
I choose the former ; I believe the reason lies in the prolongation of the period of excess current capital worldwide and the policy of central banks in Asia and the Middle East of buying up U.S. dollars .
So long as these forces are in play , the effects on financial markets recognized by the rebalancing theory will continue to be softened .
Globalized tracks .
Last year was an important milestone in the globalization process .
Benefiting from an acceleration in the pace of transnational integration , global trade for the first time accounted for a record - setting 30 % - plus of global GDP in 2006 .
From 1998 to 2006 , the increase in global trade accounted for fully 42 % of the overall increase in the world 's total output value .
This kind of trade concentration has the potential for a huge macroeconomic impact on global growth .
The rapidly exploding supply of goods and services from low - production - cost developing countries is equivalent in terms of function to a strong anti-inflationary counterblast blowing on the developed world .
Despite rapid rises in energy costs , it is estimated that in 2006 the CPI inflation rate in the industrialized countries was only 24 % , about the same as inflation levels in 2005 , which were affected by energy factors , but each year 's " core " elements did not change much .
Although the labor and product markets in most large industrial nations are gradually improving , sustained low inflation is increasingly becoming a global force , exerting an effective counterbalance effect on internal pressures that have always contributed to inflation in developed countries .
U.S. Real Estate Bubble Shock .
Like the stock market bubble six years ago , another prime - assets bubble burst in 2006 ; this time it was the huge U.S. real estate bubble .
Just as the bursting of the 2000 - 01 stock market bubble led to mild collapse , I am worried that people are discarding too quickly the risk of a similar situation occurring in 2007 .
First , adjustment of the housing market has just begun ; taking the number of workers in the U.S. home construction industry as an example , current figures are only 15 % below the cumulative increase over the last five years .
Second , over-indebted American consumers with their insufficient savings are using their increasingly overvalued houses to support their excessive consumption ; and now housing prices are turning soft , people are losing their rights to redeem their mortgage , and consumer demand will face greater pressures .
Third , in the presence of a dim outlook for housing and consumer markets and high sensitivity to forecasts of ultimate market demand , capital expenditure plans may slacken ; orders for core capital products declined consecutively in November and December , 2006 , indicating that the adjustment in this area may already be under way .
Just like the stock market bubble six years ago , widespread public opinion holds that any damage done by the recent asset bubble will be kept within the U.S. housing construction industry .
I believe this is a classic example of not learning our lesson .
The Staple Commodities Cycle .
The view that commodity markets have supercycles ran into a serious challenge in 2006 .
Oil prices slipped by more than 25 % from their mid-July peak and the price of natural gas fell by more than 30 % , and prices for major metals like copper , which are sensitive to economic trends , showed signs of weakening at the end of the year .
The main premise of the supercycle theory hangs on an extremely reliable shortage of staple commodities ; this shortage was created because in the last 20 - odd years there has been a shortage of capital to invest in building new capacity for acquisition and processing .
Whereas the advance of globalization will spur sources of new demand from China , India and other commodity - intensive economic systems , asymmetry between supply and increasingly fierce demand causes exponents of supercycles to issue the highest commodity price forecasts in history .
In my view , this does not give adequate consideration to latent demand cycles in commodity markets .
The American real estate market shock is an example of this ; a sluggish market will cause demand for many materials sensitive to the homebuilding industry to drop sharply .
However , the real demand cycle may depend on China , an economic system that accounts only for approximately 5 % of the world 's GDP , but whose increased consumption of oil and key metals accounted for fully 50 % of total global growth last year .
Influenced by the slowing of exports to the United States , combined with the deliberate cool - down in the overheated investment sector , China 's growth will slow next year .
These demand factors will be adequate to deliver a decisive blow to the supercycle view of the supply - driven commodity market .
But will the lessons of 2006 be the key to success in 2007 ?
Of course things are not as simple as that .
We can undoubtedly draw some important lessons and tips from last year 's economy , but there is another important thing here ; I still believe that the two main engines driving global growth will slow down under the influence of the burst real estate bubble in the United States and the cool - down in investments in China .
Even though I do not believe the global economy is in for a hard landing , if global growth slips one percentage point below the average of 49 % for the last four years , I will not think it unexpected .
My greatest concern is that people continue to treat lightly the continually booming risk assets markets ; they include high - yield corporate bonds , institutional credit products , emerging market securities and even staple commodities , and this is going to be the next bubble .
However , like the stock and real estate markets , the economy tells us that the extreme case of the asset markets can always last longer than we anticipate , particularly in a time of excess current capital , but if the risk assets bubble lasts another year , it may cause more problems .

[dasanicool] On North Chongqing Road near an overpass in Liuting Township , Chengyang , Qingdao City , a South Korean who does not know any Chinese can easily enjoy his habitual lifestyle : shopping , eating in restaurants , relaxing in bars at night , or soaking in a bathing center .
If he parties until near dawn and feels hungry , he can easily find a 24 - hour restaurant -- this kind of restaurant is very common in South Korea .
[dasanicool] This street only about 500 meters long is thickly lined with as many as one hundred stores .
[dasanicool] Inside and outside the stores , Korean words are almost exclusively used .
[dasanicool] The few Chinese characters also have a strong Korean flavor : " Korean Ginseng Chicken Soup , " " Loess House for Heat Therapy , " " Golden Bamboo Hat . "
[dasanicool] The service people speak Korean , and the large majority of customers are Korean .
[dasanicool] Walking at this place dubbed " Korea Street " by locals seems like walking in an ordinary small Korean town .
Only the road signs marked in Chinese and pinyin on the side of the street make you suddenly realize that this is Qingdao , China , a northern port city only one hour and 10 minutes by air from South Korea .
[dasanicool] When the first South Korean company set foot in Qingdao in 1989 , the impression left by South Koreans on Qingdao residents was that of profit - seeking businesspeople , no different from other foreign businesspeople .
[dasanicool] However , they are now integrating themselves into Qingdao residents ' lives as neighbors .
[dasanicool] Pointing at a residential subdivision near Zhongshang Plaza on Zhangzhou No. 2 Road , a Korean Chinese working as an interpreter for South Koreans said : " In this neighborhood , 40 % of the residents are South Korean . "
[dasanicool] According to officially released statistics , there are more than 5,500 South Korean companies in Qingdao , and over 50,000 South Korean permanent residents .
[dasanicool] Adding the fluctuating population , this figure rises to 100,000 .
[dasanicool] Meanwhile , there are about 2.2 million permanent urban residents in Qingdao .
[dasanicool] There is a saying circulating in Qingdao : " Running into a South Korean is not odd .
What is odd is not running into a South Korean . "
[dasanicool] This is what South Koreans generally look like to Qingdao residents : they walk hurriedly , full of plans to make money ; they look serious , and most drive cars of South Korean make such as Hyundai or Daewoo .
[dasanicool] Young people like to race high - power motorcycles late at night and revel in bars well after dark .
[dasanicool] " They are easily recognizable .
Those hanging around outside the bar -LRB- the chief entertainment and recreation venue for South Koreans in Qingdao -RRB- at 1:00 a.m. are usually South Koreans .
Qingdao residents do n't like to go to bars , and are long in bed by this hour .
Furthermore , they do n't speak Chinese fluently or do n't even know Chinese .
You know who they are the moment they open their mouths . "
That 's how Ms. Wang , a resident in the subdivision Hong Kong Garden near Zhongshang Plaza , described her impression of South Koreans .
[dasanicool] In this subdivision , rental unit ads are often written in Korean , and many houses are rented to South Koreans .
[dasanicool] With a nice climate and convenient transportation , Qingdao is considered the most suitable city to live in for South Koreans .
[dasanicool] There are as many as 37 flights weekly from Qingdao to Seoul -LRB- now called Seoul -RRB- , Daegu , and Pusan in South Korea .
There are also more than four ferry trips to and from Incheon every week .
[dasanicool] More and more South Koreans are flocking to Qingdao .
[dasanicool] In 2002 there were nearly 20,000 South Korean permanent residents in Qingdao , which increased to 30,000 in 2003 , and soared to over 50,000 in 2004 .
[dasanicool] Representative Hwang Jae - won from the Qingdao representative office of KOTRA said , " They usually move here with their whole families .
The husbands go to work at South Korean companies , the children attend elementary or secondary schools in Qingdao , and the wives take care of household chores while studying Chinese at school .
South Koreans consider here to be their second hometown . "
[dasanicool] Some South Koreans even overtly say that they are so happy living in Qingdao that they do n't miss South Korea .
[dasanicool] South Korea 's " The Chosum Ilbo " says that Qingdao is gradually being " Koreanized . "
[dasanicool] Relevant municipal government departments have at least one dedicated direct line for connecting in Korean .
[dasanicool] Most companies are staffed with Korean translators .
[dasanicool] Some hospitals have unveiled Korean - style services .
[dasanicool] Some hotels , restaurants , and bars are even exclusively open for South Koreans .
[dasanicool] When Chinese enter these venues , they feel no different from going abroad .
They see South Korean people and South Korean words , they hear Korean language .
Service personnel are all ethnic Koreans dressed in Korean style .
[dasanicool] Currently , Qingdao has one Korean language newspaper and a set of Korean language TV programs .
[dasanicool] There is a saying circulating in Qingdao : as long as you can speak Chinese , you wo n't get lost , and as long as you can speak Korean , you will have no trouble finding a job .
[dasanicool] " This is a city where you do n't need to speak Chinese to talk business . "
This is how Chang Oh - soo , secretary general of the Association of South Korean Entrepreneurs , overtly describes South Koreans ' impression of Qingdao .
[dasanicool] Statistics show that South Koreans have brought a total of more than 5 billion US dollars of investment to Qingdao and provided jobs for 330,000 people .
Of the top 20 exporting companies in Qingdao , South Korean companies account for nearly half .
[dasanicool] However , ordinary Qingdao residents do not see the benefits only that South Koreans have brought .
[dasanicool] In Chengyang District , where South Korean companies are most concentrated , there is a South Korean residential area , Yuehua Garden .
[dasanicool] Its environment is one of the best in Chengyang .
[dasanicool] " More than 80 % of the residents are South Korean .
The rest are Japanese .
Residences here are not rented to Chinese . "
[dasanicool] An entrance guard , who claims to have been here for many years , said to a reporter : " It is fine if you want to rent a house for your Korean boss , but it is definitely impossible for youself . "
[dasanicool] Pointing at the sign on the gate that says " Residential Subdivision for Foreign Businesspeople , " he said : " This is a residential area for foreigners .
Chinese are usually not allowed inside .
This is for security , ah . "
[dasanicool] Locals all know Yuehua Garden , jokingly calling it " the South Korean Village . "
[dasanicool] Locals ' most common evaluation of South Koreans is " average . "
[dasanicool] Workers at South Korean companies are mostly recruited from the Yimeng region .
[dasanicool] Locals usually do not want to work for South Korean companies .
[dasanicool] " If they go , they usually work as management personnel or after working for a period of time , they will quit to open a small store . "
[dasanicool] In the city of Qingdao , the sense of superiority that South Koreans sometimes exhibit has also caused some citizens to be displeased .
[dasanicool] In Qingdao many Korean restaurants , bathing centers , fitness clubs , and bars owned by South Koreans or Korean Chinese are exclusively open for South Koreans , with Korean language used exclusively inside .
[dasanicool] " Service people are friendly to South Koreans .
When Chinese go inside and their language betrays that they are not South Koreans , the service attitude immediately goes down . "
[dasanicool] Hwang Jae - won has lived in China for six years .
Although he has been in Qingdao for only about four months , to him there is only some discord between South Koreans and Qingdao residents .
No direct conflicts exist .
[dasanicool] " Nothing like the direct conflict between South Koreans and Chinese in other cities and certain communities in China has taken place . "
[dasanicool] South Koreans sometimes also feel dissatisfied with Qingdao residents .
[dasanicool] Young Lee Byang - yul came to Qingdao in September 2004 and opened an exclusive roller skating store in the southern area of the city .
[dasanicool] What makes Lee Byang - yul uncomfortable is that most Chinese people pay no attention to small details .
They spit wherever they want , jostle onto buses , and toss coins with one hand when returning change .
[dasanicool] " This is considered very impolite in South Korea .
South Koreans must stoop slightly and hold things properly with both hands when passing things .
I have had very unpleasant experiences with Chinese over this issue . "
[dasanicool] Hwang Jae - won feels both happy and worried about the arrival of large numbers of South Koreans in Qingdao .
" The economy in South Korea is not good .
You can find more room for development in Qingdao .
But Qingdao is very close to South Korea .
Some low - quality South Koreans have also come .
They will damage South Korea 's image .
In fact , what can represent South Korea 's image and power are large corporations like Samsung .
Unlike the numerous small and medium - sized South Korean companies in Qingdao , they are truly large international companies . "
[dasanicool] Speaking about South Koreans who discriminate against Chinese people , Lee Byang - yul said : " They do n't understand China .
In Seoul some South Koreans think China is still as poor and backward as in the past , while some people think China is not the same as before .
There are all kinds of opinions .
I wanted to come here to see for myself . "
[dasanicool] He also expressed his concern that some low - quality South Koreans will damage South Koreans ' image .
[dasanicool] In fact Lee Byang - yul is showing his Chinese employees a totally different image from that of the traditional South Korean bosses who have caused great controversy .
[dasanicool] He wears loose casual clothes , his hair is dyed yellow , and a baseball cap sits askew on his head as he sits on the staircase talking to employees .
[dasanicool] Accompanying him is not a fierce - looking dog but a cell phone .
[dasanicool] He does not count the minutes when employees go to the restroom .
[dasanicool] Employees can even talk and laugh loudly in his presence .
[dasanicool] Lee Byang - yul tries hard to prove to Chinese and South Korean people around him that true South Korean people should be civilized , well - cultivated , open - minded , and compassionate .
[dasanicool] " With a new generation of college - educated young people gradually arriving in Qingdao , there will be more people of this kind that represent the image of South Korea . "
[dasanicool] Some Chinese employees in Qingdao 's South Korean companies consider South Koreans too exclusive .
[dasanicool] " When they come to China , they feel drawn to South Koreans .
When they go shopping , they buy only South Korean products .
A pack of Chinese cigarettes sells for 15 yuan in Qingdao 's Tudari Restaurant , while outside it is 5 yuan a pack .
Yet they go out of their way to buy in Tudari because Tudari is a South Korean brand . "
[dasanicool] A Qingdao University student who has not yet graduated describes his South Korean boss this way : " All office supplies must be South Korean brands .
Daily necessities must be bought from the community convenience store exclusively serving South Koreans .
All the merchandise here is imported from South Korea , at two or three times the price of the same merchandise in China . "
[dasanicool] There are also some Qingdao residents who think South Koreans are more patriotic .
" This is their strong point . "
[dasanicool] Lee Byang - yul advises South Koreans in Qingdao to do good deeds , to gain mutual understanding with Chinese , so as not to tarnish the image of South Koreans when they come to China .
[dasanicool] " I will buy a house in Qingdao after making enough money , but I will not buy one in a residential area for foreign businesspeople that is not open to Chinese .
I want to make friends with Chinese people and be their neighbors . "
[daigaku] There are even more South Koreans in Beijing .
The estimate is now 300,000 at least .
[daigaku] But South Koreans do not have privileges in Beijing , nor are they specially favored -LRB- perhaps because there are more foreigners in Beijing -RRB- .

Is it Really Healthy to Drink Milk on Empty Stomach ?
Healthy and happy
Protein will be wasted to drinking milk on empty stomach ?
Some say drinking milk on empty stomach will consume the protein wastefully as energy ,
but actually milk contains about 45 % lactose , which is carbohydrate that will decompose first to supply energy and save protein .
In addition , milk also contains about 3 % fat , which also plays the role of supplying energy .
Therefore , drinking milk on empty stomach will not lead to protein waste .
The fact that infants under the age of one can drink milk on empty stomach and absorb nutrients proves that milk contains a variety of nutrients that can be fully used by the human body .
Even if the digestion rate will be slightly lowered , it is healthier to drink milk on empty stomach than to eat nothing the whole morning when there is no time for breakfast .
Tip : drink boiled water before milk .
It is not appropriate to take milk as the only drink in the early morning .
When you get up in the morning , it 's better to drink a big glass of boiled water -LRB- light honey water is better in case of a dry indoor environment during the heating season -RRB- before consuming milk .
As milk has higher osmotic pressure , it is far less quick and effective compared to boiled water in terms of supplying moisture .
Who can not drink milk on empty stomach ?
What needs our attention is that if there are abdominal distention or diarrhea after drinking milk , it is then indeed inappropriate to drink a lot of milk with on empty stomach .
It is better to have some starchy food before you drink milk in multiple small serves , and it is better to have yogurt .
Experts said milk can not be consumed on empty stomach 20 years ago , because Chinese had few chances to drink milk .
Once they were weaned from breast milk , they hardly saw any dairy products .
Long - term separation from dairy products led to " lactose intolerance " of the body .
People suffered abdominal distention , diarrhea or dyspepsia whenever they drink milk .
If they drink too fast , especially drinking milk on empty stomach , the symptom would exacerbate .
Now time is different , and the diet pattern has also changed .
Many children and young people often consume milk , yogurt , ice cream and even cheese since childhood , which bring them strong ability to digest milk lactose .
Even if they drink milk on empty stomach , they will not feel uncomfortable .
So , the so - called remark of " no milk on an empty stomach " should be changed , at least with a premise added , instead of being generalized .

[jilian] To speak of China 's strategic nuclear strike capacity : with the successful test - firing of a submarine - based ICBM , and General Zhu Chenghu 's revelation of China 's strategic nuclear strike capacity sufficient to " bury hundreds of American cities even at the same time as all Chinese cities east of Xi'an were being destroyed , " the " intelligence " that the " highly effective " US intelligence departments have been assuredly apprising Japan and Taiwanese separatists of " for decades without changing " that " China has only 20 ICBMs capable of hitting the US , " has become a " joke " like " Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction , " along with the mighty image of " a USA impervious to China 's nuclear threat and capable of protecting Taiwanese separatists and Japanese who threaten China 's core interests . "
[jilian] Following the above " joke , " " the effectiveness " of " the missile defense system " that the US used to effectively neutralize the " Chinese and Russian " nuclear threat , relying heavily on its space satellite system , was once again suddenly turned into a " joke " by Chinese weapons .
[jilian] Because of this , the last fig - leaf of Washington 's " absolute capacity " in East Asia , the Middle East and Europe to serve as the " military protector of Japan , Taiwanese separatists , Israel and Poland " has fallen away .
[jilian] Liu Jianchao 's advice -- " for Japan , following the road of peace is in its most basic interests " -- was not spoken lightly .
[jilian] Obviously , given that the nuclear strike capacities of " China and Russia " both have the capacity to destroy the US ; given that both " China and Russia " have announced that they " possess " the capacity to completely wreck the " missile defense system , " the construction of which the US has dragged Japan and Poland into contributing funds for ; if those countries or forces hope to rely on the nuclear protection of the US and are ready to take whatever they can get in a " China - Russia - US " conflict , they may have to watch out .
[jilian] Do n't let everything you have get smashed to smithereens without getting anything good out of it .
[jilian] It is very clear that if " China , Russia or the US " really want to start an action for the sake of their own space within which they can strategically develop , then restrained by the reality of " nuclear destruction , " they will most likely use their force against the " strategic pivots " of their enemies .
[jilian] The Americans ' strategic pivots first off include Japan and Israel .
[jilian] Therefore , as for the Taiwan Strait issue , in the eyes of Eastday commentators , Liu Jianchao 's advice a few days ago , that " for Japan , following the road of peace is in its most basic interests , " was absolutely not spoken lightly .
[jilian] As soon as there is a change in the Taiwan Strait , as soon as China and the US have knocked out all of each other 's military satellites , then in the East Asian airspace that is " even closer " to China , US aircraft carriers will have no way to get close for back - up , due to the threat from the attacks by China 's long - distance conventional weapons .
[jilian] As a result for the F - 22 , which has " impressive " stealth capabilities against airborne phased - array radar , but " greatly reduced " stealth capabilities against China 's land - based high power phased - array radar and high power long - wavelength radar ; [jilian] given that they will not be supported by satellite intelligence , will not be supported by EWR aircraft intelligence , [jilian] given that the F - 22 will be forced to turn on its own airborne radar to enter combat ; [jilian] given that all the airfields of the F - 15 and F - 16 squadrons of the " US and Japan " will be within the range of China 's long - range armaments ; [jilian] faced with a large fleet of fighter planes made up of fighters such as the J - 10s and J - 11s with Beyond Visual Range air and sea strike capabilities , with land - based radar picking targets , carrying " pl - 12 " medium - range guided air - to - air missiles , highly maneuverable and with a large enough combat radius ; as well as the J - 8d and f , with their good high - altitude and high - speed features ; how much real chance of victory is there ?
[jilian] Particularly in tactical terms , China could surely forward deploy large numbers of unmanned reconnaissance vehicles with highly matured technology .
[jilian] This also means " extending " the " aerial reconnaissance platform " out ahead of their own squadrons , [jilian] performing comprehensive search with optical and magnetic reconnaissance technology , conducting joint search and positioning with AWACS and ground - based radar systems , and directing J - 10s , J - 11s and J - 8s to targets .
[jilian] This way in the airspace over the East China Sea and Taiwan Strait , it can definitely use geographical superiority to greatly restrict the stealth advantage of the F - 22 and to magnify their numerical disadvantage .
[jilian] Obviously , given China 's ability to " attack the intelligence chain , " faced with China 's mighty capacity for precision long - range strikes , unable to receive support from land or naval forces , as soon as they also lose the effective support of their advantageous military space reconnaissance satellites , in reality , the US air force and navy that rely heavily on space intelligence , with no superiority of numbers and far from its US homeland -- we do n't think their chances of victory are great if they are fighting right next to China .
[jilian] If the US Tries This Trick , Can China Deal with it ?
[jilian] In dealing with China , the US always likes to use its hard side -- its great military strength .
[jilian] This is very expensive , and is also very dangerous to itself -LRB- particularly if China uses force against Taiwan -RRB- , and will not necessarily achieve the desired result .
[jilian] But if the US changes to another method of dealing with China , it might be much more effective .
[jilian] If the US wants to crush China , it should find out what China 's biggest weakness is .
[jilian] This is the only way to really hit the spot .
[jilian] I personally think China 's biggest weakness at the moment is " corruption . "
[jilian] The problem of corruption arises in every country ,
[jilian] but what 's worrying is that in China today official corruption is too widespread .
Even more worrying is the public 's level of acceptance of corruption .
[jilian] With this weak point in mind , the key to crushing China does not lie in setting up however many bases around China or preparing however much world class weaponry .
It just needs the US government to use half an aircraft carrier - worth of money to set up a fund , and secretly bribe China 's key officials .
[jilian] It would n't look good for a government to undertake this kind of slimy activity .
A company or individual could be asked to do it .
[jilian] Bribery targets : key officials in the central government , key officials in regional governments , general managers of large state owned enterprises , and elites .
In addition , let their children go to school in the US and train them to be " top returned Chinese " that work for the US .
[jilian] In less than 20 years , see if China can still deal with it .
[jilian] This is the simplest and most effective technique for defeating one 's enemy soldiers without fighting .
[] Tricks of the trade of writing social science articles .
[] <POSTER> alvarado
[alvarado] This semester I took a professional writing course , the teacher 's lectures were very interesting , about how to frame an article , lots of it was stuff I previously overlooked .
Here I 'm going to present it for everyone to share .
[alvarado] Warning : the technique does n't guarantee that your article will be published ; to a very large extent this will be determined by the quality of your work .
[alvarado] How to frame the article and how to master some tricks are very , very useful .
[alvarado] One extreme case is a professor who originally graduated from our department ; you could say she 's one of America 's best field workers , the quality of the things she does is extremely high , and most people do n't attain the difficulty of her field work .
[alvarado] She is able to get low - income single mothers to record their income and expenditures every month and can also get them to tell her their sources of unlawful income .
[alvarado] Plus , she 's white , the product of a middle - class home , and the targets of her research are almost all black and Latina .
[alvarado] But the early articles she published , despite having a large influence , were a failure in terms of structure .
[alvarado] The most interesting thing is that she first went to Rutgers -LRB- in this discipline it 's a second - tier school -RRB- , but she did n't get tenure .
Our teacher is a friend of hers and says the main reason is that she ca n't write articles , and the number published is rather low .
[alvarado] Later , after she figured it out , based on her original work , she published a series of extremely diverse articles , and she continued her original work ; she put out a very influential book , and needless to say she got tenure at a name school .
[alvarado] Next semester she 's going from UPenn to Harvard , and she may be the chair at Harvard .
[alvarado] So even a fine wine wo n't get sold if it 's hidden away ; good material needs to be highlighted .
[alvarado] What are the tricks here ?
[alvarado] If you 've already had articles published in top social science periodicals , no need to continue reading .
[alvarado] First , the abstract and the first three pages determine who it will be reviewed by and even whether it will be accepted .
[alvarado] The writer needs to be able to manipulate the editor ; do n't let the editor manipulate you .
[alvarado] For example , right off the bat you need to point out what area your research makes a contribution to ; you need to be completely specific , do n't beat around the bush .
[alvarado] The editor ca n't understand everything ; he first looks at the opening and the abstract , and it 's in field A ; all right , he picks four folks out of a reviewer pool .
[alvarado] Therefore you definitely need to make clear who your targeted reviewer is .
[alvarado] This is my inserted comment -RRB- The problem my Chinese classmates easily fall into is , let 's say in the context of China , which issue is very important , which issue does my article seek to resolve , all right , maybe I can get it into China Quarterly , it could go into that kind of publication .
[alvarado] But if you want to get it into a specialized publication , then you need to point out what contribution this China case makes to the field , otherwise it wo n't be sent out for review and that will kill it .
[alvarado] Next , what should you do when your target may be two different fields ?
[alvarado] One strategic choice is to figure out what your selling point is , which field your selling point is more fresh and important for , then target it at that field .
[alvarado] For example , if you feel your article is significant for two fields , A and B , but one important point in it is conventional wisdom in field A , but it is something new in field B , then target it at B .
[alvarado] Also , highlight your selling point .
[alvarado] Or if it 's a new model , variable , data , method , point , etc. , you should certainly highlight it , give it more space .
For example , the failed articles by that teacher we mentioned above basically did not highlight the difficulty and innovation of the data collected -LRB- the selling point -RRB- but just spent one paragraph on it and moved on .
[alvarado] Also , do not offend your reviewers .
[alvarado] Like a really poor literature review , other people before me were all wrong , but I 'm right with this .
[alvarado] Of course no one would be stupid enough to say it directly like that , but many failed articles contain that kind of thinking .
[alvarado] The correct approach is that previous authors did well , but I 'm pushing it a step further .
[alvarado] Or previous authors did A , B and C , they 've already discussed everything fully , but it seems they overlooked D , which has a major impact on our understanding of the field as a whole or a certain question .
[alvarado] Or previous writers had models ABC , they all explained a lot of questions , but some questions they were unable to explain , and my D can explain these while at the same time including ABC , etc .
[alvarado] In short , do n't imply that " all the people are stupid . "
[alvarado] Finally , there is also a type of research that debunks a popular view or research on a hot topic ; at the same time , it also has theoretical significance , so you want to put something eye - catching right up front so people can see it , put the public debate up front and the theoretical things after .
[alvarado] These are all little tricks ; be careful they do n't turn into overkill , LOL .
-- [alvarado] --
[alvarado] Be with the crowd , be alone , know your strengths and weaknesses ; speak not and hear not , be muddleheaded ; shun the spotlight and fame , cultivate wisdom and intelligence ; be active and at peace , leave behind the external and the internal .

I 'm getting older , and my mom is worried about me getting married ; I 've seen a few to ogle at , but I 've cut them off , and also some have cut me off .
No success so far .
Finally somebody introduced me to one ; we made a schedule for the weekend to go to a classmate 's house for dinner , and also meet the new date .
She looked not bad ; she was a former co-worker of our classmate 's wife ; her appearance was proper , and eating and all was no problem ; I 'm just an ordinary older WSN .
mm chatted and chatted , and discovered that she and my female cousin were classmates , that was really exciting .
Then ... nothing more until after March , when I came back from a business trip ...
My schoolmate 's wife is not too bright , and she was unable to help me ask mm out about her opinion , and I was also embarrassed to ask , and all my schoolmate could do was invite us to dinner again .
mm was very happy to come to dinner , but I am rather shy -LRB- so my cousin says -RRB- .
So I did n't talk to her , and after dinner we all sang K , then my classmate 's wife suggested I see mm home .
She refused , and after that I never got together with mm again ...
That was my first time ... for a blind date ...

[A14062] Does it mean that one should not go abroad if he or she is patriotic ?

What happiness ?
They are simply the underprivileged .

[A14062] In the end , the Chinese should follow their own road without waiting , relying or complaining .
[A14062] Drastic steps should be taken to train , retain and attract talents .

[Jerry0803] The Death of Ethnic Chinese Soldier Sun Ming , Hoping It is the Last -LRB- Original -RRB-
[Jerry0803] A Chinese national fell on the Iraqi battlefield after joining the US military force .
[Jerry0803] His name is -- Sun Ming .
[Jerry0803] The US Army gave him very high honor : the Purple Heart , Bronze Star medal that symbolizes the highest honor .
[Jerry0803] The Purple Heart , Bronze Star is the highest honor awarded by the Defense Department next to the Medal of Honor [Jerry0803] and the Silver Star .
[Jerry0803] The former is awarded to courageous fighters , while the latter is only awarded to soldiers who are injured or fall in war .
[Jerry0803] At the same time , a certificate that grants Sun Ming the US citizenship was also handed solemnly to Sun Ming 's parents .
[Jerry0803] This should be the prizes from the US government .
[Jerry0803] In Serving the People , the obituary of Comrade Zhang Side , Mao Zedong said : " when people die in the village , a memorial service should be held [Jerry0803] to express our deep grief in this way . "
[Jerry0803] The same is true .
No matter which country Sun Ming served , he was still a well - behaved Chinese citizen at the moment of his death .
[Jerry0803] I express my sorrow for his death and my sincere condolence to his family : please accept my sincere condolences .
[Jerry0803] What I want to say now is the significance and value of Sun Ming 's death .
[Jerry0803] Before we figure out this question , we must clarify whether the nature of the Iraqi War is righteous or not ?
[Jerry0803] If it is righteous , then the death of Sun Ming is significant , no matter to the United States , to China and even to the people all over the world .
[Jerry0803] He then is an internationalist warrior like Bethune who should be remembered by the entire human kind .
[Jerry0803] On the contrary , if the Iraqi War is not righteous , then the death of Sun Ming is not honorable at all .
It is even not worthwhile or regrettable .
[Jerry0803] As far as the International Law is concerned , any war unauthorized by the United Nations is disputable in terms of its righteousness .
The honorable title is not widely recognized for those who fall in the war .
[Jerry0803] Simply put , there would be two possibilities if it is included in the textbooks .
[Jerry0803] One is the country waging the war would depict him as a hero for later generations to revere ; The other is the country forced into war would regard him as a negative character for later generations to revile .
[Jerry0803] It is well known there are two the Iraqi wars .
One is the 1991 Iraqi War , [Jerry0803] which was sanctioned by the United Nations and represented the punishment by righteous forces around the world on Iraqi invasion into the sovereign country Kuwait .
[Jerry0803] Without doubt , that Iraqi War was righteous in nature .
[Jerry0803] Obviously , any soldier on the righteous side who sacrificed his life in this war , their death was meaningful to the world .
[Jerry0803] However , the second Iraqi War , the Iraqi War still going on , is done by the United States leaving the United Nations aside .
[Jerry0803] This is the reason why the war can not be righteous in nature , no matter which countries or people believe Iraq should be beaten up , [Jerry0803] because emotions can not represent the law .
[Jerry0803] This is just like an unpardonably wicked villain .
No one group or individual has the right to sentence him to death except the judge .
[Jerry0803] If anyone has an itch and decides for the judge , the guy would be a manslaughter .
[Jerry0803] I believe those who love " America " will not call me a sucker for comparing them this way .
[Jerry0803] The United States is a very charming country .
When a Chinese citizen devoted his life to American interests , it gave him the treatment of a US citizen generously .
[Jerry0803] Sun Ming , whose biggest wish had been becoming a US citizen , can now close his eyes if he is still conscious in grave .
[Jerry0803] But I have some other different thoughts .
Now that the dead is gone , we should care more about the alive .
[Jerry0803] For example should n't the US government do something for the bereaved families of " martyr " Sun Ming .
[Jerry0803] Simply put , anyway it has to give a token of affection , right ?
[Jerry0803] It can just send them away with a " Certificate of Martyr " and some consolation money .
[Jerry0803] Especially the words of Sun Ming 's father " I hope the war ends as soon as possible , I hope the Bush administration ensures the safety of American soldiers .
Do n't hurt any families any more . "
[Jerry0803] Should n't the US government consider it seriously ?
[Jerry0803] Life is precious , and the United States is a nation that loves life and cherishes life .
[Jerry0803] If it yells nothing is more valuable than life on the one hand , and it sends US soldiers across the world to bleed and sacrifice on the other hand , would n't the two be self - contradictory ?
[Jerry0803] How can it say it loves life and cherishes life ?
[Jerry0803] The US government says they have sent troops to Iraq to free the Iraqi people .
[Jerry0803] With mountains and waters between us , I do not know the attitude of the Iraqi people and thus can not judge groundlessly .
[Jerry0803] But subconsciously I have a feeling that it is nothing more than a fight between two gangster heads for turfs .
[Jerry0803] The Bush administration is the Water Margin , which holds up the flag of " acting for the god " without the authorization of Zhao Jie , destructing Zhujia Village today and eliminating Zengtou City the next day , and it is hard to say if it is attacking Daming City the day after .
[Jerry0803] The Saddam regime are the likes of Tian Hu and Wang Qing .
The public resentment can not be dispelled if they are not killed .
[Jerry0803] Is n't the death of Sun Ming the same as the deaths of Wen Zhongrong and Cui Ye .
[Jerry0803] Tang Bin , Wei Zhongrong and Cui Ye were all former subordinates to Tian Hu .
He wailed loudly as they were companions , [Jerry0803] while Song Jiang was merely miserable .
[Jerry0803] On the contrary , let 's see what Song Jiang looked like when his brothers died .
[Jerry0803] In Chapter 112 of Water Margin , it says : " Mo Shan killed " White Faced Squire " Zheng Tiantao , and the two hit by poisonous arrows were " Dagger Devil " Cao Zheng and " Living Pluto 's Wife " Wang Dingliu .
Hearing three more brothers were lost , Song Jiang let out a cry and collapsed onto the ground .
It is not sure how his five organs were , but his limbs were not moving . "
[Jerry0803] As the proverb goes some relatives are close but some are distant , and some people are close and but some are estranged .
[Jerry0803] Another goes while it is not pitiful to die , it is pitiful not to die for the right thing .
[Jerry0803] How sad Sun Ming , just over 20 , sunshine , smiles , pimples and a life like the morning rays , disappeared unexpectedly with an evil bullet .
[Jerry0803] Any love , beautiful love , my wretched child -- have you , ever experienced ?
[Jerry0803] Amen -- .
[Jerry0803] All relies :
[Jerry0803] A reminder : China was against the United Nations in Chinese - Indian , Chinese - Vietnam , and the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea - concentrated sulphuric acid <removed_junk> .
[Jerry0803] o One is dragging the United Nations to attack others ~ one is resisting the United Nations to attack itself ~ it seems - Light <removed_junk> .
[Jerry0803] Leaving aside the political factors , the silly guy was too careless about his life !! - Xixihahahehe <removed_junk> .
[Jerry0803] Thinking about the mine disasters happening in China practically everyday , are n't the miners killed and injured even more wretched than Sun Ming ? - No life is paid if someone is exasperated to death <removed_junk> .
[Jerry0803] It is fine as long as he does n't help the US fight against China , otherwise his ancestral grave would be smoking - schakalhund <removed_junk> .
[Jerry0803] Hope all Chinese citizens wishing to migrate to the United States join the army as soon as possible - J , Yu <removed_junk> .

[] I Want to Go Home
[] <POSTER> daysafter
[daysafter] I have come to cry and vent .
I am truly feeling too upset .
[daysafter] Three and a half hours ago , I learned my bf 's father has already been remarried for several days .
The woman brought a little sister with her .
[daysafter] Back then , I also did not learn about their divorce until much later .
One thing that made me sad was that they did n't care at all about what I thought .
It would have been nice if they had asked me in advance whether I had any opinion about this or not .
They did not show the least respect for me .

Many discoveries are made by chance .
Michael Zhou
I remember my first year studying at Qinghua , I went to my first elective course called " Inspirations in the History of Physics . "
There were only ten or so of us who had chosen it that semester .
The teacher was very erudite , his lectures were very lively ; he summarized all of the recent and contemporary history of physics , and each time I was enthralled .
In all my five years at the university , I never had another course that interesting .
If I were to summarize this course , it would be : the greatest discoveries in physics all had their own necessity and theoretical basis -LRB- for example , the development of mathematics -RRB- .
This theory can also be applied to cooking .
One day I wanted to make green beans and bean curd sheets -LRB- dried tofu in the Northeast -RRB- .
Here the dried tofu sold in the stores is all compressed , very tough .
So I normally steep it in hot water , then take it out and stir - fry it .
Because that day I needed to go out in the middle of it and buy some things , I set the timer and told my wife to turn off the heat when it was done .
My wife is very lazy , and when the timer sounded , she turned off the heat and left the pot sitting on the stove .
When I came back and looked , the dried tofu was white and soft , just like freshly made .
Chalk another good one up to the wife .
Qingqing 20070104
bill shen
Cloudy , temperature about four degrees Celsius .
Yesterday Qingqing did not fall asleep till 1100 .
He looked sleepy on the train , but he did n't sleep .
Yesterday Qingqing gave Mom a very clever retort .
On the train Mom noticed Qingqing farting and asked Qingqing whether he +wanted to poo .
She also said to Qingqing : " I gave birth to you , how could I not know what you are thinking about ? "
In the evening when washing his feet at home , Mom said : " Let 's sell our house , buy a house next to Grandma 's , and give Dad the remaining money to start a business with , is that okay ? "
Qingqing did not say a word and stared at Dad .
Dad shook his head .
Mom asked Qingqing : " Why are you staring at Dad ? "
Qingqing replied : " Do n't you know what I am thinking about ?
Why do you still ask me ? "
In the morning Dad woke him up .
Soaked crackers for breakfast .
Dad fed Qingqing .
Getting ready to go to the kindergarten , Dad said , " Let Mom take you there . "
Qingqing did not agree : " I want to go with Dad . "
Dad said : " Is it because Dad 's vehicle has a canopy ? "
Qingqing did n't say anything .
Dad helped Qingqing put on his gloves and took Qingqing to the kindergarten .
Qingqing wanted Dad to tell the teacher : " I lost a tooth and can not eat properly . "
He just did n't want to say it himself .
Dad told the teacher , and Qingqing also opened his mouth for the teacher to look at it .
He looked very funny .
Then he pulled Dad over to look at Qingqing 's drawer .
Dad helped Qingqing clean it up .
There is some other child 's stuff in Qingqing 's drawer .
Qingqing took it out and put it back into the child 's drawer .
When moving the chair , Qingqing pushed it : Some children in our class move chairs just like that .
Dad wanted to help Qingqing .
Qingqing did not want it .
He wanted to move it by himself .
When Dad came back in the evening , Qingqing was running around holding Mom 's cell phone , talking to Uncle over the phone .
He promised Uncle yesterday that from now on he would take Uncle 's call .
Qingqing was calling Uncle " stupid , " just like he called Dad .
After finishing the call , Qingqing showed Dad the math book he got from the auction and told Dad : " I know how to do math . "
He also said : " Today Mom and I went to pop the rice ovalettes .
The rice ovalettes were still moist , so they did n't get fully popped . "
He then play the keyboard by himself , turning down the volume so as not to disturb the old grandma next door from her rest .
What a thoughtful kid !
Dad had had a bit too much to drink and did not talk much to Qingqing before he fell asleep .

" 8 / 15 " - our victory day .
（一）
For the Chinese people , today is a special day .
This day came with great difficulty for China .
Before the war , the gap between China and Japan was far greater than mere numbers .
Before the war , China 's steel production was less than 200,000 tons -LRB- steel production in China was centered mainly in the northeast , and it was controlled by the Japanese -RRB- .
Japan 's was about 9 million tons .
The important thing is that Japan had a complete industrial system and was able to independently produce all its weapons , from handguns to aircraft carriers , and it had a formidable research production capacity .
At that time , every year they were able to produce 1,580 airplanes , 744 large - bore cannon , 330 tanks , , more than 9,500 vehicles , with a shipbuilding capacity of more than 400,000 tons and a naval construction capacity of 50,000 tons .
Compared to this , at the time China could only produce rifles and small cannon ; its capacity to produce heavy weapons was zero .
The only munitions plant capable of producing heavy weapons in the northeast was taken over by the Japanese .
This means that China 's consumption could not be met .
Before the war , China 's air force had some 300 airplanes ; that may seem like quite a few , but they were all used up in just one year , and afterward we could only watch as Japanese aircrafts ruled the skies over China .
On the surface , China is a large country , and Japan was the little guy taking on the giant .
The most obvious part of China 's being a big country was its population advantage .
In fact Japan 's total population after it had taken over Taiwan , the Northeast , and Korea was not so very much smaller than China 's , with about 200 million people , at best a 2:1 ratio .
The important thing is that Japan had a complete reserve system , with more than four million reserves who had received basic military training .
China had basically no reserve military personnel , and the " national army " relied primarily on seizing able - bodied men to fill its ranks .
These so - called able - bodied men were sorely lacking in training ; all they could do was learn to fight in battle .
Therefore , in the field , it often happened that a Japanese battalion -LRB- battalion system -RRB- was able to defeat a whole division of the Chinese army ; it was not just the difference in equipment : even more important were the differences in logistical supplies and training .
> The training gap in particular can be said to have been the difference between earth and sky .
In terms of the standards of Western armies , except for a few divisions , at the time for most of the millions of Chinese military units of every description it would be more appropriate to speak of militia , or mobs of bandits .
What was even more disheartening was China 's disintegration :
After ten years of bloody battles between the Nationalists and the Communists , and among the warlords like Jiang , Feng , Yan and Gui , China 's vital organs were diseased , and it was like adding frost on top of snow .
Japan 's plans to " conquer China in one attack " and to " take China in three to six months " were not mere fantasy .
China 's low - key War of Resistance also had a basis in reality : it seemed that without a miracle , China would be doomed .
-LRB 2 -RRB-
But the miracle happened , and what is more , this miracle was created by the Chinese people !
In the face of an unprecedented national enemy , the Chinese race demonstrated rare courage and fortitude .
In terms of their military strength , China 's army taking on the Japanese army was like an egg attacking a rock .
But the eggs advanced again and again , and the wounds on the rock added up !
In Shanghai , in Taierzhuang , in Wanjialing , the prestige of the " Great Japanese Imperial Army " came tumbling down again and again .
In his memoirs , Li Zongren took great delight in talking about Taierzhuang , where he used cast - off troops , Sichuan troops and Northeastern troops to inflict heavy losses on the supremely arrogant " Great Japanese Imperial Army " ; in his own view , it was all rather inconceivable .
For four years , from 1937 to 1941 , China fought against Japan on its own , and it even counterattacked .
China organized a winter offensive on the front in 1939 .
In 1940 there were a hundred battles in the enemy 's rear area , which let the Japanese army know that their enemy was still alive and kicking .
In order to resolve the " China incident , " Japan sent in even young boys to fight ; at the height of it , there was only one division left in Japan .
Of course if Japan had fully mobilized , it could have called up several million more troops , as in the later time when they knew they were about to be annihilated .
But mobilizing troops at home and sending them off to another country are two different things ; it was just that their logistics could n't support it .
Troops leaving the country to fight need to be lean and vigorous .
It was n't that the Japanese did n't want to settle the " China incident , " it was that they could n't .
What created this miracle in reality was the awakening of the sense of modern Chinese nationhood .
In historical China , you were loyal to the emperor , not to the country .
Yue Fei directly smashed the home of the enemy in order to wash away the " shame of Jingkang and the officials ' regret . "
When Shi Kefa wept blood , it was for the death of the Chongzhen Emperor .
In the War of Anti-Japanese Resistance , the Chinese people burned with an enormous patriotic fervor , and they demonstrated a fierce determination to resist .
In their memoirs , generals of the Nationalist army mention that when they were wounded in the civil war no one paid any attention , and they themselves all felt like thieves .
But generals wounded fighting the Japanese received endless fresh flowers in condolence , making them feel like the center of attention .
This was such an enormous contrast that it was a great stimulus for the Nationalist army generals .
With the fatherland in jeopardy , even overseas Chinese demonstrated unprecedented patriotic fervor , vigorously supporting China 's War of Resistance , providing both manpower and financial aid .
Large numbers of overseas Chinese returned to fight ; in some years the aid donated by overseas Chinese amounted to one - half of the government 's expenditures , creating a fresh contrast to the historically poor image of the Chinese as lacking civic pride and being politically indifferent .
During the War of Resistance , overseas Chinese donated hundreds of times more money than did overseas Japanese .
The Central Army , the Jin Army , the Sichuan Army , the Northwest Army , the Gui Army , etc. , and of course the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army , which until then had been implacable enemies , came together to rescue the imperiled nation , and that was not an easy matter .
At the time , the officers and men of the Red Army almost all had an account of blood and tears .
The Nationalist Army 's purging of the Red Army base areas was no less fierce than the Japanese policy of killing , burning and looting .
If we think of the end of the Ming Dynasty , when the state was about to fall , the southern Ming continued its bickering , with endless internal disputes among the various princes who all seemed to be enjoying it .
-LRB- In Jin Yong 's masterpiece , Luding Annals , just for the sake of selecting an heir between Zhu Three and Zhu Five , two royal families started fighting and got one of the key persons killed , which stirred up a great storm . -RRB-
The state of disunity repeatedly lamented by Sun Yatsen had quite unexpectedly turned to unity , and at least in the early phases of the War of Resistance all sides basically cooperated in good faith and all made an effort ; it ca n't be said that this is not a miracle of history .
For example , Brothers Magic Sky -LRB- Chen Qingpin , Chen Zhonghou -RRB- previously read a book ; the author signed his name as " Shaohua , Youhu . "
The book was entitled " Lin Biao : His Life "
In the ninth chapter , " First Medal in the War against Japan , " it mentions that after the great victory at Pingxingguan , Lin Biao was accidentally wounded .
At the time , the chief of staff and front - line commander of the Kuomintang 's second theater of operations , Wei Lihuang , got the news and made a special trip to Ershilibao in Yan'an to extend his condolences .
The next day , he was unexpectedly detained as he returned to Xi'an , and he personally ordered that the Eighth Route Army be given a million rounds of ammunition , 250,000 hand grenades , and 180 boxes of cartons of beef .
" Thirty days later , when more than ten military trucks brought the ammunition and canned beef to Ershilibao , a flush of red appeared on Lin Biao 's pallid face , and he said repeatedly , " It 's a huge gift , it 's a huge gift ! "
This shows that the War of Resistance was the cradle for the rebirth of the Chinese people .
During the war , the Japanese left no stone unturned in threatening to bribe Chinese into collaborating .
But of the many powerful local warlords , not one went over to the other side .
Even outmoded warlords like Yan Xishan in Shanxi , or Long Yun in Yunnan , or Wu Peifu could not be won over .
Compared to the end of the Ming Dynasty , it can not be said that this too is not a miracle .
-LRB- 3 -RRB-
Around Sept. 18 , 1931 , China , despite entreaties at the League of Nations , never got any sympathy or support , but after July 7 , 1937 , China relied on its own resistance to win international respect and assistance ; Heaven helps those who help themselves .
A strong sense of nationhood supported the Chinese people through repeated losses and battles , and helped it get through those dark days .
China 's perseverance was just the right thing to strike at Japan 's weak spot ; countries like Japan have trouble sustaining a high - intensity war .
The First Sino - Japanese War , the Russo - Japanese War and 9/18 all ended in a short time , and there were no destructive effects on Japan 's economic structure .
On the other hand , each time they fought , they acquired a large amount of booty , which greatly increased Japan 's strength .
But the War of Resistance was not like that ; the Japanese were unable to support the war through fighting .
Despite America 's strength and wealth , it was even unable to bear the cost of the Vietnam War .
Four years of fierce fighting in China had in fact left Japan exhausted ; military spending was exploding , inflation at home was soaring , supplies were stretched thin , gold and foreign currency reserves were depleted , and the domestic economy was on the verge of collapse , and this enabled America to throttle the Japanese by the neck , meaning that they forced the Japanese to take a highly risky military gamble .
The outbreak of the war in the Pacific was a turning point .
Since Japan is an island , sea transport is its lifeline , so the decisive field of battle was the Pacific .
The Chinese field of battle had already fulfilled its mission .
China did not have the strength to chase out the Japanese army .
And the Japanese did not have the capability to wipe out the " Chongqing army " and the " Yan'an army . "
Both sides could only stay put and wait .
" If allied forces win , China can not lose ;
If the allied forces lose , China can not win . "
Although it upset the Americans , the Kuomintang blamed the Communist Party for not attacking ; the Communist Party accused the Kuomintang of remaining passive , but that was necessary at the time .
Although we were unable to drive the Japanese out , because this exceeded China 's industrial capacity and technical and economic levels at the time , " 8/15 " is still our Victory Day .
Our sacrifice well deserves this victory , because we made every effort .
Among the five victorious nations of the Soviet Union , the United States , China , England and France , China is more qualified than England and France to bask in the glory of victory .
Before WWII , in the area of world industry and modern military affairs , China was really unworthy of mention , not even on a par with Poland , Yugoslavia or any other mid-level European country .
China 's contribution to the war against Fascism in fact far surpassed its own abilities .
And this contribution was made using " blood and flesh to build our new Great Wall . "
For this day , millions of Chinese soldiers stained the battlefield with their blood , and tens of millions of ordinary people died , billions of yuan in assets were lost : it was a huge price to pay .
We can not forget our glory , nor can we forget the price we paid .

Several years back Zhou Zuoren and Zhang Ailing 's works thrilled a generation .
But some people complained that they have been treated unfairly .
Their works certainly appeal to the emotions and tastes of people nowadays who have gotten rich by various means , and literarily speaking they could sometimes be original .
But literature is a moral force , and the integrity of these easy - living social paragons is even lower than that of thieves ; they certainly have no sense of duty to their country , and it can even be said that they have no shame .
How can they expect to be respected by society as a whole ?
What kind of soul do their works have ?
If we can forgive Zhou Zuoren and Zhang Ailing , then how , at the very worst , can we face Zhao Yiman , Yang Jingyu and Chao Shangzhi , who at the same historical period crawled over ice and slept in snow , willing to die rather than yield ?
Our world is still not peaceful ; our enemies are still eyeing us covetously .
Wang Jingwei , Zhou Zuoren , Zhang Ailing and their ilk should be relegated to history 's wall of shame forever .

EBay Announces Today It will Acquire Ticket Website StubHub for 310 Million US Dollars
eのsnail
According to the international reports on January 11 , eBay announced that it will acquire online ticket website StubHub for 310 million US dollars in cash to further expand its influence on electronic commerce .
The acquisition is expected to be completed before April .
More than six years ago , Jeff Fluhr and Stanford School of Business graduate Eric Baker founded StubHub with Fluhr as its chief executive officer .
Fluhr said in a statement : " StubHub 's business model is an excellent fit with eBay , and we have admired eBay for a long time . "
Over the past two years , as investors were concerned about the slowdown in eBay 's online auction business , its poor management , slow business expansion , and other factors , its market value has been dwindling .
In succession eBay acquired Internet phone service Skype and online price - comparison company Shopping.com .
StubHub mainly operates ticket brokerage to major events .
In 2006 its ticket sales was 400 million US dollars with annual profits reaching 100 million US dollars .
Ticket sellers selling tickets on this website must pay a 15 percent fee , while buyers also have to pay a 10 percent commission to StubHub .
As of now , five million tickets have been sold on the StubHub website .
Do CPA's in the US Make a Good Living ?
I used to work for an accounting firm in China .
It 's not a big city , but I always thought the job I had was not as hard as others imagine .
Perhaps that 's because people before me had long established a set of models .
I 'd like to ask those who have passed CPA exams in the US whether you are making a good living .
It 's also very hard for me to pass the CPA exams in China .
And now in the US , I may find an average school to study for a master 's degree , and then , and then do I have to start preparing for CPA exams here too ?
Also , in China CPA and certified tax agents are separate .
In the US , are there exams for certified tax agents ?
Is the work of tax agents done by accounting firms as well in the US ?

Title : Yun Dan Shui Nuan : Who to Look into the Backroom Deals Behind the Privatization of State - owned Shandong Luneng Group ?

Who to Look into the Backroom Deals Behind the Privatization of State - owned Shandong Luneng Group ?
Yun Dan Shui Nuan
As the year 2006 ended , so did a big hush - hush " deal . "
Caijing Magazine described it as " a quiet change of ownership for this vast business empire . "
These were the final few steps as Shandong Luneng Group " completed " its privatization .
In the past , when I heard the big name of Luneng Group , I usually would link it with soccer .
I could never expect it is a 73.805 billion yuan giant .
Yet , in the privatization of this giant , it turns out that the fairy tale of " big returns on a tiny outlay " once again played itself out .
It was incredible that the fairy tale once again played itself out as the former senior managers of a state - owned company changed in the blink of an eye into the " bosses " of a " private " company .
Given these fairy tales , we should ask what backroom deals there were behind this .
Behind a fairy tale there must be backroom deals .
This is now almost an undisputed truth .
There 's never been a money fairy or goddess of wealth who gives wealth to anyone without any reason .
Zhang Rongkun , the main player in the Shanghai social insurance case , with a " new " company that was just registered and claimed to have 500 million in capital , was nevertheless able to acquire the 99.35 % stake in Shanghai Luqiao held by Shanghai Chengtou at a price of 3.2 billion yuan .
Gu Chujun , with a mere 900 million , " acquired " top - quality state - owned assets with a total asset value of 13.6 billion .
The backroom deals behind have already been revealed , and have entered into legal procedures .
And the privatization process of Shandong Luneng is also bound up with " acquisition . "
And in 2006 , the " final " total " cost " of this acquisition , according to a report in the magazine Caijing , was 3.73 billion yuan .
It was described by some as " 3 billion buys up 76 billion . "
For the " buyers , " you could use the minute probability , zero probability such as winning the lottery or pie falling from the sky as an analogy .
This means backroom deals .
First , according to the Caijing report , Luneng 's privatization process lasted 11 years -LRB- 1995 - 2006 -RRB- .
From state controlling stake → employee stock ownership with state investment → 100 % state controlled → employee stock ownership → private ownership , it has gone through five stages .
Yet , in this process , the real inside story is little known .
" Sneak into the village ; do n't fire the guns . "
In particular , the final stage of privatization turned out to be " top secret . "
The magazine Caijing reports : " The names of the two ' new owners ' of Luneng were once called ' the top secrets of top secrets ' among a very small circle inside Luneng .
Now it is exactly these two mysterious companies , whose names are unknown , that have taken over absolute stock control over this financial conglomerate . "
Ordinary people would think that since it 's a well - known former state - owned company with huge assets that is connected with investment and operations in a large number of fields and connected with state - owned assets of enormous value , every step of its changes should be taken in the light of day , completed under the supervision of the relevant regulations , and inspected under the gaze of the public and the media .
If it 's all rule - abiding , reasonable and legal , then why fear exposure ? Why all in secret , hidden away , veiled ?
Only if you know you have done something dishonest , will you be so much afraid of people knowing and try to make it " the top secret of the top secrets . "
Secondly , at the recently concluded plenary meeting of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission , they required and emphasized strict monitoring of corrupt practices in the financial sector by party members and leading cadres , particularly in the area of the transfer of state - owned assets .
Luneng Group 's former chairman Gao XX and Luneng Group 's former director - general Xu X , who have " already " changed into " private entrepreneurs , " " continue to serve their former posts " in the new " private company . "
So , did these two Party members -LRB- Gao XX previously held the positions of chief of the Shandong Linyi administrative office , deputy head of the electrical utility bureau , assistant to the head of the Shandong electricity bureau , and general manager and party secretary of Shandong Luneng Stock Controlling Group . Having gone through all of Luneng 's stock transfers , he is still currently the chairman of Luneng Group . Xu X has served as head of the electrical utility bureau of Linyi , Shandong . In about 2003 he first entered the headquarters of Luneng Group as vice president assigned to manage property operations , after which he was very quickly promoted to the president of Luneng Group -RRB- , in the process of the series of mysterious stock deals at Luneng Group , carry out the unshirkable duties which the party members should undertake regarding state - owned assets and the public interest in strict accordance with the CPC Charter and the Party 's strict discipline ?
Did they seek private gains for a small group or for themselves ?
If it was all above board , they should submit a report to the party organization on the process of their transformation from the senior management cadres of a state - owned company into " private entrepreneurs " and even announce it to the public .
Thirdly , according to a 1998 audit report , when Shandong Luneng Group was first established in 1995 , it had 150 million yuan in registered capital , and operational assets of 2.6 billion yuan .
A more concrete image is " just five people and one office " expanding at an unimaginable speed in just 11 short years into Shandong 's 73.805 billion yuan giant , incorporating coal - fired power stations , mining , real estate , engineering and construction , finance and sports clubs .
In this process , where did Luneng Group get its assets and opportunities for expansion ?
Luneng 's background and Luneng 's " birth " are inseparable from the state - owned monopoly of the electricity industry .
The electricity industry has huge assets and occupies a market position of natural monopoly .
During Luneng 's rapid expansion , how much " blood " it actually extracted from state - owned assets seems to be a " cloudy issue . "
What 's the idea with scrambling to " complete " privatization before this issue is cleared up , handed over to the public and announced to the media ?
Fourthly , it 's said that the two private " companies " that finally " assumed ownership " of Luneng Group , Guoyuan Union Co. and Shouda Nengyuan Energy Co. -- according to descriptions in the media , these two companies can be called " low profile " and " mysterious . "
If it was an open and above - board " assumption of ownership , " then why the " mystery ? " Why the " low profile ? "
According to reports , the origins , backgrounds and sources of capital for these two companies are completely beyond comprehension .
Is it possible that by some kind of " buying from yourself " process they have embezzled state - owned assets ?
Fifthly , the departments supervising state - owned assets and the electricity industry are SASAC and SERC , respectively .
But with Shandong Luneng Group undergoing such enormous changes , they say they " do not know what 's going on . "
They say , " We have not yet received Luneng Group 's application materials for the transfer of stocks . "
But what 's strange is that according to reports by journalists , Luneng Group 's business registration has in fact already " been adjusted . "
What 's more , " since November 2006 , Shandong Provincial Administration of Industry and Commerce has not allowed requests to see or inquire about the files of the Luneng family of companies . "
What on earth does this mean ?
Is it the Caijing reporter " making rumors , " or are the relevant departments neglecting their supervision ?
No matter how it is , now that the media have publicly reported on it , there ought to be some answer .
So , who exactly will look into these backroom deals that have been exposed by current reports ?

An Intellectual who was a Lifelong Leading Official until Death -- A Few Disrespectful Words about Director Ba
613305
-LSB- Ghost turning the mill -RSB-
The lifelong term system of leading cadres is not good , and it has long been criticized by intellectuals .
The so - called idea about the lifelong term system of leading cadres means when the end of a term of office comes , or when a given age is reached , they should step down .
This point has already been put into practice , though not fully implemented in reality .
Some very bad practices have n't been abolished yet : i.e. the lifelong remuneration system for leading cadres .
What is known as the lifelong remuneration system for leading cadres means that when a leading cadre steps down from his senior position , he still retains his level of remuneration such as " division leader level . "
Even worse is that as soon as you become a leading cadre , you are then a leader for life , with no need to worry about any problems of being laid off .
If your department disappears , it does n't matter , either .
A sinecure can always be arranged for you at a salary high enough for you to maintain your integrity , like going to the CPPCC to serve as some deputy chairperson .
If you do n't break the law , you will only move upwards , you wo n't slip downwards .
I think we should completely abolish the life - long term system of leading cadres .
For example , if a person is mayor , when he steps down at the end of his term , he could no longer be given mayor level remuneration .
If he is not able enough and becomes a division leader , then he should be remunerated at the division leader level .
If he 's even more incompetent and has been laid off , then he should be like a laid - off factory worker and collect unemployment benefits .
He should n't go to the mayor , but to the markets .
The " iron rice bowl " was broken for workers decades ago .
There is no reason why leading cadres should still be holding onto a golden rice bowl .
I 've had a look at Director Ba 's biography and was surprised to find that Director Ba had been chairman of the Writers ' Association since 1983 right up until he passed away .
I think that the Writers ' Association is n't any kind of important department affecting the national economy and people 's livelihood and whether it was the lifelong term system would draw nobody 's attention .
But Director Ba , as an intellectual who always spoke the truth and stood up for what was right , should have known that the lifelong term system of leaders is not good , and should have been opposed .
Moreover , when Director Ba became chairman of the Writers ' Association , he was already quite elderly .
Doing it for one or two terms , he 'd be +really senile however you look at it .
He had his own health problems .
How could he have that much energy to manage the affairs of the Writers ' Association ?
It would have been better to get off the pot .
In fact , in his last days , Director Ba lay in the hospital , unable even to speak , completely reliant on medical intervention to keep him alive .
Even if he wanted to manage , he would have been unable to .
" Harvest " magazine was created by Director Ba single - handedly , and he was always its chief editor .
Even if later on it was Director Ba Junior who took over the work , it still carried Director Ba 's name .
After Director Ba passed away , the magazine still wrote that he was the chief editor .
In the end someone got really mad and filed a legislative complaint .
But this affair had no further development afterwards .
I guess the biggest reason maybe is because of Director Ba 's great influence , everyone settled out of court ; both sides gave a little ground , and Director Ba Junior no longer used Director Ba Senior 's name in doing advertisements for the magazine .
To say a little more : right now all the intellectuals are all heaping praise on Director Ba 's " Random Thoughts . "
They think it " speaks the truth , " " stands up for what 's right . "
However , what I like is Director Ba 's " Torrents " trilogy and " Cold Nights . "
Director Ba had written the works that made his name , and are his greatest works , before he was thirty .
I believe that what he said at that time was very honest .
He was using his heart and blood in his writing .
If you read the afterwords he 's written you 'll know .
He says he was often crying as he was writing .
I 've also seen that Director Ba was +under the deep influence of extreme leftism at that time and said many good things about the totalitarian society .
Guangzhou Starts Puffing Itself up -LRB- reposted from Moonlight blog -RRB-
Dift Wu
I went to sina.com today and suddenly saw a " strange " article from China Business News : " Guangzhou to Become First Mainland City with a GDP per Capita of over 10,000 US Dollars " <http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2007-01-04/051211947888.shtml> .
It says that the mayor of Guangzhou has said that calculated by the number of people registered as residents , the GDP per capita of Guangzhou this year will exceed 10,000 US dollars .
The reason I thought it was strange was because according to some data that I already knew about <http://www.williamlong.info/archives/459.html> , Guangzhou 's GDP per capita should only reach the target of 10,000 US dollars in 2010 .
Even though the RMB has increased in value , it still could n't be this fast .
This figure must have something wrong with it .
And the reason for the problem was still the population figure .
Shenzhen and other cities all calculate GDP per capita using the permanent resident population in the calculation .
For cities with such large migrant populations , a GDP per capita calculated using the number of registered residents will be very inaccurate .
If Guangzhou calculates the GDP per capita using the permanent resident population , it 's obviously puffing itself up .
People from Guangdong are usually very low - key about wealth .
They 'd never compare these vanities with Beijing or Shanghai .
This way , they can pay a little less tax to the central authorities : keeping quiet to get rich .
In addition , everyone is very clear about the situations in Guangzhou and Shenzhen .
For many years Guangzhou has been just a little behind Shenzhen in its economic indices and all aspects .
Its GDP will soon be exceeded by Shenzhen 's , yet its population has always been higher than Shenzhen 's .
I remember I wrote an article " The Mystery of Shenzhen 's GDP per capita <http://www.williamlong.info/archives/459.html> . "
Shenzhen 's GDP per capita is calculated using the number of permanent residents , and it is predicted that it wo n't top 10,000 US dollars until about 2008 .
How could Guangzhou 's leaders make this kind of wild assertion ?
This kind of showing off has never been the style of people from Guangdong .
Various signs show that the new team of leaders in Guangzhou may have been transferred from another region .
They tend to like boasting and like playing number games to seek rewards from the central authorities .
If this really is the case , then Guangzhou 's prospects for economic development may be indeed not good .
Fewer empty words and more real action has always been the straightforward style of people from Guangdong .
Only by keeping the wealth among the people can a nation be ultimately rich .
Making the majority of people rich is the most important .
I hope the new team of leaders in Guangzhou will carefully learn from the experiences and lessons of the last few administrations and not to rival with places like Beijing and Shanghai in exaggeration .
Otherwise Guangzhou 's development will really be a cause for worry .

Topic : Cultural Revolution ? Makes Me Think of the Past
Posting station : BBS Unnamed space station -LRB- Wed Jan 24 00:42:30 2007 -RRB- .
This anti-Cui " movement " made me think of the past .
When I was in junior high school , a man who lived nearby died ; I do n't know why , but rumors started flying , everybody said his wife murdered him .
The two of them had been together for many years , and at the time their two children were older than I was .
This man was very honest , and the woman had always been very sociable , and even though the medical examiner had already examined the body , I do n't know where all this talk came from , but the man 's family insisted on reopening the casket and re-examining it .
This affair stirred up quite a hubbub in our little town .
My mom , too , just kept discussing it on and on .
To my mind it was totally uninteresting , I just felt these middle - aged women were extremely suspicious , and I could n't see what all the fuss was over that woman .
Then one day my mom was at the table , the saliva spraying , and I just could n't stand it anymore .
Mom , do n't keep repeating what other people say , OK ?
You say somebody killed somebody ; what proof do you have ?
My mom rapped her chopsticks on the table : You 're just a kid , what do you know ?
There are no waves without wind ; if this were nothing , people would n't be talking about it so much .
I did n't dare answer the old lady back , but I thought to myself : Just wait and see , wait until this woman has been proven innocent , then you wo n't have anything to say .
This woman was really quite a character ; not only was she on good terms with some of the bigwigs at the plant , she was also quite familiar with the head of the city 's public security bureau , who had been transferred over temporarily from the plant .
The matter of whether to open the casket dragged on and on , and finally , because the pressure from public opinion was so great , they re-examined the body , and the result was poisoning .
When that came out , everybody was in an uproar .
To calm the public , finally there was a trial , and the woman was found guilty of murdering her husband .
Everybody felt that , in such a case , she would certainly get the death penalty , but she was given a stay of execution .
After several years , the head of the city 's public security bureau became head of the provincial public security department , and then some people said that again this woman might show up in the provincial capital .
I think that if the world did not have " wretched men " who waste endless time tangled up in this sort of thing like Cui 's , or " big - mouthed women " like my mother , people like them , who I feel have always been good at certain things , then people would be able to get away with murder or other crimes .

[jilian] The New Year has just passed , and the news comes that beginning on April 1 , 2007 , Russia will completely prohibit foreigners from working in retail ; by the end of 2007 , all non-permanent points of business will be eliminated .
[jilian] This implies that Chinese in Russia will be forced to leave the country , and they will suffer inestimable moral and financial losses .
[jilian] Folks on the Internet have reacted furiously to this , and some have gotten emotional and very angry .
[jilian] Others are shouting that we need this Russian ally of ours and must not cast off that friendship over a small matter , and we ca n't get Russia angry .
[jilian] The response on the Internet has been a dispute rarely seen in the forums .
[jilian] Right now , people are focusing their attention more on the government and the foreign ministry , expecting the government to step up and take some action to resolve this expulsion of Chinese that the world is watching .
[jilian] However , the views of the Chinese embassy in Russia on this matter , obtained through Internet channels , gives one pause :
[jilian] " With regard to Russia 's newly revised immigration law , " says Ambassador Liu , " in the short term , implementation of Russia 's new law will have a certain effect on Chinese businessmen traveling in China , but in the long term , it will benefit the long - range business and development of Chinese businesses there . "
[jilian] He said , " The many Chinese businessmen there should adapt to the situation and revitalize the way they plan their development to better develop themselves , and at the same time the embassy will provide assistance and guidance " -LRB- China 's ambassador to Russia , Liu Guchang , in an interview with Phoenix Satellite Television , transcript provided by the embassy in Russia -RRB- .
[jilian] Responding to the host 's questions about this , Professor Wang Lijiu , Russian affairs expert with the China Contemporary International Affairs Institute , in a relaxed tone , again stressed : Russia is not targeting the Chinese in particular ; Russia is entitled to regulate its markets ; Chinese people should adapt as quickly as possible .
[jilian] In his view , it seems this matter does not affect him at all , and there is no sign that he has any empathy for his Chinese compatriots .
[jilian] The attitude revealed by China 's ambassador and the Russian expert leaves people bewildered ; is the ambassador so weak that he does not dare raise any objection ?
[jilian] I think that 's unlikely !
Given China 's current international position , this seems impossible !
[jilian] Is he stooping to compromise on the matter for the sake of the overall situation of the two countries ' relations , therefore being unable to negotiate with Russia ?
[jilian] We must not underestimate the intelligence and efforts of the embassy comrades ; in terms of Professor Wang Lijiu 's explanation , since Russia established this policy , the embassy has already negotiated .
[jilian] But if they have negotiated , then why is Russia still carrying out this barbaric , large - scale expulsion of Chinese ?
[jilian] In terms of how Russia and the Russians have been understood for years , it 's another case of the Russkies not buying what the Chinese embassy is selling ; that is , it 's their little plot of land and whatever they say goes ; not even God can interfere -LRB- that 's the character of the Russian race -RRB- .
[jilian] Looking at it in this way , we can understand the plight faced by the embassy ; when you negotiate with Russia , the Russkies do n't listen , and moreover there are some practical questions in this situation .
[jilian] Getting hostile with the Russkies is also too unreasonable ; in today 's international environment , relations between the two countries are so important that if we fall out over this , it 's really losing sight of the forest for the trees ; the result of conflict is so grave that nobody can take the responsibility for it .
[jilian] But with the vital interests of tens of thousands of compatriots in Russia and pressure at home , the embassy can not help but offer explanations .
[jilian] Therefore , making that kind of strange remark through Internet channels - using the rationale of Russia putting its markets in order and cleaning out foreign immigrants to gloss over Russia 's irrational harshness and appease the anger of our countrymen .
[jilian] From this standpoint , the embassy comrade also feels quite bad !
[jilian] But however bad they may feel , it ca n't be as bad as those compatriots who have lost a living !
No matter how bad , the embassy should reach out a helping hand to its compatriots and do something !
[jilian] For a long time since the Chinese and their products have been entering Russia , they 've set off on an arduous journey .
[jilian] They 've experienced Russia 's heavy customs duties and extortion , and in the markets they 've endured all sorts of piratical taxes and intimidation including the police - infested underworld , and the increasingly harsh , blatant robbery committed by Russian government agencies against the Chinese in the name of " gray customs procedures " ; all these things show that the action taken by the Russians this time just had to happen .
[jilian] If it did n't happen today , it would tomorrow .
And since this happened today , it means that in a not - too - distant future , even tomorrow , Russia will take even more extreme measures to cope with those Chinese !
[jilian] With regard to Russia 's repeated extortion and elbowing out of the Chinese -LRB- in fact we ca n't find any other more accurate or appropriate terms for it -RRB- , the Chinese government , in its recorded negotiations with the Russians , has never told us anything workable for this situation .
[jilian] Therefore it is said that in the policy adopted by Russia today there are certainly elements of the Chinese side having negotiated weakly , leaving the Russians room to cause problems .
[jilian] This is not the way to do things .
With the IQ of the Chinese , is it really impossible to solve this problem ?
[jilian] No !
[jilian] Beginning with the breakup of the Soviet Union , Chinese light - industrial products gradually took over a large share of Russia 's markets , and in the Russian view this has definitely not been a good thing .
[jilian] But it was precisely these Chinese products that rescued and sustained the Russian markets .
[jilian] If there had been no good - quality , low - priced goods coming from China , the Russian people would in fact have been unable to endure the low - income life after the breakup of the Soviet Union .
[jilian] From clothing to toys to slippers and household items , it was Chinese goods that kept Russian prices stable at a level that ordinary Russians could bear .
[jilian] Without the support of Chinese goods , the price of every commodity in Russia would have risen sharply !
[jilian] Professor Wang Lijiu 's view is not correct .
He says that , if there had been no low - priced goods from the Chinese market , it would only have affected the lower levels of society and those collecting pensions .
[jilian] " In Russia , ordinary working people are the vast majority , the bulk of consumers , and every weekend , or on a certain day in each household , the head of the household regularly makes a special trip to the Chinese market to buy goods , and this has become a part of their everyday lives .
[jilian] Without Chinese goods , they could only go buy so - called medium - and high - end goods , and with these goods being in short supply , the prices of all medium - and high - end goods would rise , without exception .
[jilian] Therefore we say that the actions taken by the Russians now will have negative effects on all of Russia .
[jilian] From Web sites we can see that Russia already thought of these kinds of effects when it formulated this policy of expelling the Chinese .
[jilian] They are planning on waiting until this sort of situation arises , and then they will step up with a new , adjusted policy on immigration .
[jilian] If they can see this , why ca n't we see and make use of this point ?
[jilian] In 2003 , SARS broke out in Beijing , China and Russia closed their seaport customs offices , and prices soared in just a short time in Russia 's Far Eastern regions , and the local people 's reaction was unusually harsh and negative .
[jilian] But that was a natural disaster , and it could n't be helped .
[jilian] From this we can see and confirm this news : Chinese goods affect the lives of a large share of the Russian people .
[jilian] When the lives of the Russian people are impacted by rising prices , they will certainly be displeased with their government .
[jilian] When the Russian people are dissatisfied with their government , there will certainly be people demanding that the government take , or the government will on its own take , measures to resolve the people 's discontent !
[jilian] Our on - line folks should rest assured on this point ; Russia is a democratic autarchy , and sometimes the efficiency with which it takes actions that correspond to the people 's demands is quite high .
[jilian] Moreover , our experts point out that the actions taken by the Russian government and Putin 's election strategy are related .
[jilian] Even if it 's to win over people 's minds , the Russian government could certainly pass a law to resolve the price issue .
[jilian] Just as you ca n't make a meal if you do n't have rice , Russia basically does not have the ability to resolve this issue by itself in a short period .
[jilian] What to do ?
[jilian] Let them wrack their brains to come up with an answer !
[jilian] Have n't they already done the calculating and forecasting to resolve this issue ?
[jilian] Do n't we really understand we Chinese in fact hold the power to resolve this issue in our hands !
[jilian] There are three strategies for resolving this issue : Best , middle and worst .
[jilian] Worst strategy : speak out strongly against the Russian government 's expulsion of the Chinese and appeal for the safeguarding of Chinese dignity ; suspend all trade with Russia .
[jilian] But when we do this , it will undoubtedly damage the fine relationship that China and Russia worked together to establish .
[jilian] This is certainly losing sight of the forest for the trees , and the results will harm rather than help our compatriots in Russia .
[jilian] Internationally , this will only make our rivals happy and our friends sad !
The U.S. , Japan and Taiwan will be laughing at us .
This is not feasible !
[jilian] Middle strategy : continue to restrain ourselves , stoop to compromise , and suffer quietly .
[jilian] Focusing on maintaining the alliance in international politics between the two countries and their mutual relationship .
[jilian] Although our compatriots will suffer losses , at least the sky is not falling ; the Chinese are the world 's most adaptable race , and by gritting our teeth we can always get through this .
[jilian] Right now the embassy is taking this approach !
[jilian] But when we do this , how can we face the tens of thousands of our compatriots in Russia , how can we face the fervent expectations of the people in China toward their government ?
[jilian] The embassy must know how very much vituperation it has endured on the Internet .
But do they understand the on - line folks ' heart - felt intent ?
[jilian] And as for the Russian government , it can only step up its deprecation and belittling of the concerned parties in China , and further foster its deliberate aggression and arrogance .
[jilian] It gets more overbearing every day , stirring up a new tempest between the two countries and leaving behind hidden dangers !
[jilian] Adopting this kind of policy is absolutely unacceptable !
Wake up before it is too late !
[jilian] Best strategy : pull out the firewood under the cooking pot , face the situation with ease , and give them a taste of their own medicine .
[jilian] Do not cross swords directly with the Russian government ; in the name of strengthening Sino - Russian friendship , improving the inherent quality of products and strengthening product quality control , apply strict quality control to goods headed for Russia .
[jilian] How strict ?
[jilian] Beginning now , if one Chinese product does not meet product quality requirements , regardless of whether it is clothing or shoes and hats , all of the products in the hands of commodity inspection agents are inferior products .
[jilian] For the sake of Sino - Russian friendship , we must bear responsibility for the Russian people , and we can not send substandard goods outside the country !
[jilian] Inspections must be thorough , including for travelers , with weight limits strictly enforced for carry - on bags .
[jilian] With this approach , China 's foreign affairs offices can conscientiously explain to the outside world that we are doing this for the sake of developing regular trade and friendship between the two countries .
[jilian] Besides , it 's a matter for the commodity inspection departments , and they act in accordance with international requirements ; we are powerless to interfere .
[jilian] Comrade ambassador , you have recently been harshly castigated by the Chinese people ; take this opportunity to go to the Alps for some R & R and do a little skiing ; go to Hawaii to go surfing and relax , and let the Russian officials look all over the world without finding you .
[jilian] -LRB- Winter is almost over ; the new peak season for demand will soon be here .
It will only take a few months for the Russians to become like ants in a hot frying pan , seeking and begging the parties concerned in China ;
[jilian] when that time comes , we can discuss with them , from a proactive position , the matter of Chinese goods entering Russia normally , the matter of letting our compatriots sell those goods , discuss the matter of the security of our compatriots and their merchandising locations , and discuss the question of Chinese people regularly [jilian] and legally paying taxes in Russia . -RRB-
[jilian] As for the matter of when quality inspection standards can be loosened up , and to what extent , we will determine that according to such factors as Russia 's internal situation , the Russian government 's attitude , and the process discussed unilaterally !
[jilian] This approach provides timely help to our compatriots in Russia and it is the best support !
[jilian] With Chinese products not coming in , warehouses are ultimately limited , and scarce goods become expensive ; there will be no urgency to sell off goods that are n't coming in regularly , and people will come up with ways to use their legal status to protect their goods and themselves , and sell off the goods they do have at a good price -LRB- in Russia , things wo n't sell slowly anyhow -RRB- .
[jilian] If China really uses this approach , our compatriots will gain from this disaster !
[jilian] In this way , there might be some short - lived impact on seaport trade units and domestic foreign - trade manufacturers .
[jilian] But this impact is not created by the Chinese .
[jilian] If we do not use this approach , the impact on them will be even greater .
[jilian] Without our compatriots working hard in shipping goods and selling to Russia and establishing regular trade channels in Russia , the manufacturer 's interests will sooner or later be harmed .
[jilian] And the government 's behavior will lay the foundation for long - term development in the future .
[jilian] As for the Russian government , because the policy of expelling the Chinese will have led to soaring prices , it will face pressure from many sides : international public opinion , the Chinese government , the Russian public , and all the Russian parties vying in the elections .
[jilian] There will be a basic transformation of the former situation , in which our embassy battled the Russian government alone .
[jilian] This approach benefits bilateral relations , Russia saves face , and the blister on its foot is something Russia itself will have to live with .
[jilian] History and geography have already determined that the relationship between these two great countries is an informal alliance .
[jilian] Dealing with this alliance relationship is not simply a matter of being conciliatory ; it 's more one of unity in conflict , conflict in unity ; without the conflict , there is no unity .
We need to master the art of conflict .
[jilian] In this bilateral relationship , China has no capital for being hostile , nor does Russia .
[jilian] With this approach , there is no need to fear that goods from other countries will step into the vacuum and replace Chinese goods ; North Korea , South Korea , Vietnam and the Central Asian countries all face the same crisis in Russia .
[jilian] Right now they are keeping an eye on China 's reaction ; if China handles the matter well , it will also give them ambitions , thereby increasing China 's prestige .
[jilian] Since Russia introduced the gray customs procedures the year before last , I have been expecting the government to take such measures as handling the big issue with smart power and pulling firewood out under the cooking pot to resolve the issue of Russia 's expelling the Chinese , but what I have seen has merely been Russia getting an inch and taking a foot !
[jilian] I became fluent in Russian based solely on self - study , and I have strong feelings for Russia .
[jilian] I hope our ? ? in the streets of Russia ; the reason is very simple : it 's because - I am Chinese .
Be Your Own Psychiatrist .
Li Xu .
In today 's society , fierce competition , cultural conflicts and material temptation disturb our minds incessantly , which often make us feel worried , anxious , upset and furious .
People also try to adjust themselves in material ways , but those often fail to work : exercises can not lessen the concerns at heart ; physical and mental fatigue persist not long after traveling ; the soft water bed can not bring comfortable sleeps ; and the luxurious room can not dispel the disputes of spouses .
That 's why someone proposes that modern people learn a new survival skill -- learn to be your own psychiatrist , helping yourself to dissolve all sorts of metal stresses at work and in life .
Be your own psychiatrist , simply put , is to improve your ability adjust yourself psychologically .
To elaborate , it means there should be a special role in your mind who possesses " the third eye " mentally to observe your emotional changes sensibly and find out the reasons for mental disturbances .
It is just like the " guardian angel " whom everyone has in Western legends , who gives you wisdom at critical moments and help you deal with the intricate reality properly , so that you will not lose direction .
There was a famous British psychologist named Ellis in the last century , who encouraged people to learn a special , reasonable and healthy way of thinking by reading professional books , organizing group discussions and doing specific training in thinking , in order to deal with emotional problems caused by stresses .
He should be the first one to advocate " learn to be your own psychiatrist . "
He encourages people to learn a new way of thinking like " learning a foreign language . "
The most important aspect in being your own psychiatrist is to learn to substitute the healthy way of thinking for the unhealthy way of thinking .
For example , ask two people to observe the same glass , if one notices a tiny speckle and the other notices the mild color , then the former 's thinking pattern might be pessimistic , while the latter might be more sensitive to the positive aspect of things , which is a healthy and optimistic way of thinking .
Thus , learn to observe the positive aspect of things has become an important training .
To be your own psychiatrist , you should also learn to observe stress - related signs .
For example , if you have a stomachache , your normal response is to see a gastroenterologist .
Through observation by " the third eye , " you may see that the reason can be your new demanding boss .
To be your own psychiatrist , you also need to learn appropriate knowledge .
There was a student at the Tsinghua University , who were troubled by " depression " for a while .
When it was bad , he wanted to jump out and commit suicide at the sight of a window .
With some psychological knowledge , he knew it was a symptom of mental disorder , so he immediately sought help from professionals and received treatment soon .
Now in many European and American countries , some intellectuals including young college students like to read psychological books .
Psychological books can always be seen in the best seller lists in these countries .
Most readers do not aim to become counsellors , but to learn psychological knowledge to help personal growth .
Such healthy awareness is worth learning .
This july , lemonade , music , and the summer breeze .
What the Chinese Nation Needs Most is a Son like Zhou Enlai -LRB- In Commemoration of the 31st Anniversary of the Death of the People 's Good Premier -RRB-
613305
-LRB- Who knew the string was broken -RRB-
People all like to call themselves son of the people , and son of the Chinese nation .
However , there are standards for being a son of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people .
Not everyone can be called son of the people and the nation .
In addition , the people and the nation also have certain conditions for selecting their sons .
Anybody who wants to can not just become a son of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people .
What kind of son do the Chinese nation and the Chinese people need ?
She needs a son who is absolutely loyal to her , yet she neither needs nor accepts those who are only loyal on the surface , or in speech , toward the entire nation and all of the people , but in reality are political and economic parasites who are only loyal to themselves , loyal to their own family clan , loyal to their own small clique and small social stratum .
She needs a strong man of the times , a revolutionary and politician , who works wholeheartedly for the benefit and happiness of the entire nation and all of the people , she neither needs nor accepts those who only flaunt the banner of seeking benefit and happiness for the entire nation and all of the people , but in reality are vulgar villains and political liars who seek benefit and happiness only for themselves , for their family clan , and for their own small clique and small social stratum .
She needs a strong man of the times , an outstanding revolutionary and politician who is fully focused on , as well as capable of , making the Chinese nation prosperous and strong , and making the Chinese people wealthy and happy ; she neither needs nor accepts those shameless opportunists and hoodlum politicians who betray and sacrifice the political and economic interests of the entire nation and all of the people for themselves , their own family clan , and their own small clique and small social stratum , for the sake of their own gratitude or resentment , prestige , and interests , leaving the Chinese nation and the Chinese people to suffer loss , disaster , and humiliation .
She needs a giant of the times and an outstanding politician who spares no effort in performing his duty to make the Chinese nation rise and stand out among the thicket of the world 's nations , to allow the Chinese people to proudly live in happiness and harmony in the world , with heads high and chests out ; she neither needs nor accepts those national scum and common enemies of the people who for themselves , their own family clan , and their own small clique and small social stratum , for the sake of their own gratitude or resentment , prestige , and interests , make the Chinese nation and the Chinese people inferior or second - rate in the world .
Let 's look throughout history and count the heroes .
The history and reality of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people can tell the world that only such outstanding revolutionaries and politicians as Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai are the most needed , most qualified , most outstanding , and most loyal sons for the Chinese nation .

In Memory of Zhou Enlai : Zhou Enlai was Indeed Mao Zedong 's Close Comrade - in - arms
-LSB- New Philosophy -RSB-
Zhou Enlai was a loyal defender and implementer of Mao Zedong Thought .
This was sufficiently proved by the victory of the 4th Anti - " Encirclement " campaign , the victory of the Red Army 's 25000 - li Long March , the victory in the Anti-Japanese War , the victory in the War of Liberation , as well as socialist economic construction .
Some say that Zhou Enlai followed the " doctrine of the mean . "
That is not true .
The " doctrine of the mean " only mechanically implemented the " mathematical logic " theory for development and change in the material world .
In fact , Zhou Enlai best understood and mastered the " Concept on People " of Mao Zedong Thought , and best understood and mastered the concept of " The Development of Human Society " of Mao Zedong Thought that focuses on " events , not people " in transforming human society .
In politics , Mao Zedong wanted to transform people 's ideology , rather than to destroy people .
Mao Zedong dealt with those comrades in the Party who committed blunders by " learning from past mistakes to avoid future errors , and curing the sickness to save the patient ; " he treated KMT war prisoners by transforming them .
Ever since Mao Zedong 's leadership position in the Red Army and Party Central Committee was established at the Zunyi Conference , Zhou Enlai had always been Mao Zedong 's close assistant .
Zhou Enlai accurately understood and mastered Mao Zedong Thought .
He protected many comrades and democratic personages from brutal attacks and persecutions during the Cultural Revolution .
Zhou Enlai %pw sincerely implemented diplomatic guidelines and the blueprint for constructing the " Four Modernizations " proposed by Mao Zedong .
Zhou Enlai was approved of and supported by Mao Zedong and was loved by the general populace as well .
He gave his all until his heart ceased to beat .
Li Xiannian once said : " We often say that we must serve the people with heart and soul .
What is heart and soul ?
In my opinion , Comrade Enlai is an example for us . "
Deng Xiaoping once said that during the Cultural Revolution , because of " the prestige of Chairman Mao , Premier Zhou , and other older generation leaders , even though an ' all - out civil war ' was said to have occurred , real civil war did not occur , as in the end it was not a large - scale fight . "
" We will learn from his absolute loyalty to Marxism , Leninism , and Mao Zedong Thought . "
Mao Zedong Thought was the most valuable spiritual wealth of the Chinese people .
Zhou Enlai established an example for us through his accurate understanding and mastery of Mao Zedong Thought , and implementation of Mao Zedong Thought .
Zhou Enlai was a great Marxist !
Zhou Enlai was indeed Mao Zedong 's close comrade - in - arms !

Low - Cost Flying ; the Chunqiu Airline Experience .
vox
The country 's first civilian - operated airline is headquartered in Shanghai .
The first impression is that the English name is too vulgar , china-sss.com , would anybody be interested in putting this company 's announcement on Jay Leno ?
I heard people saying the ticket prices are cheap .
Then I went online and looked ; there are A and B classes , but no first - class cabin .
Every day a certain number of specially priced seats can be reserved only online .
The ticket prices are certainly the cheapest .
Chunqiu is encouraging online booking with a 30 - yuan discount , which saves on costs .
But paying online in China is extremely complicated ; that 's another story .
The baggage limit is 15 kg , but I see lots of people whose baggage are definitely over that .
I did n't see complete data online for their flight safety record .
The A320 model is one commonly used only on minor routes .
The planes are not as old as the same models in the U. S.
Signs say the life vests are under the seats , but in fact under the seats it 's absolutely empty .
Someone next to me asked the flight attendant , and she was unable to answer .
A male flight attendant then said there were no life vests .
After I got back to the States I hitched a ride on a plane of the same model , and the signs said the seat padding could be used as a flotation device .
That must be correct .
On board , aside from a small bottle of water , no beverages were offered , but they were selling boxed meals , all of them with the same packaging , for ￥28 a box .
There were also soy - sauce eggs , preserved eggs , peanuts and other snacks .
I do not feel that this is a good approach on brief short - haul passenger flights .
First , they have to remember the passenger 's order and seat number , collect the money -LRB- and check for counterfeits -RRB- . Then heat the meal , deliver the meal ... there 's more than just one type of meal , and the preparation is n't always simple .
It 's all helter - skelter enough .
Many people were still eating just before the plane landed .
Plus they also enthusiastically peddle gifts to earn extra income . Such as model airplanes , dolls ...
I saw one person pay 200 for a model airplane .
In order to reduce the number of empty seats , the plane even has passengers going to different destinations ; after the plane landed at Shanghai , those people stayed on the plane and waited for the cabin to be cleaned and tidied , and only after new passengers were boarded did they continue on their way .
After we landed at Shanghai , an airport bus transferred us ; they did n't use the bridge .
They said this was another cost - saving measure .
In short , the plane was on time , the baggage was delivered quickly , and the service was OK .
This kind of train - like business approach is rather unusual .

Copyright announcement : May be reproduced at will ; when reproducing , please be sure to hyperlink the original source and the author 's information and this announcement http://www.donews.net/pangshengdong .
Note : I'm 'm really embarrassed if this header is a bit flashy , but there 's no other way ; I hope more media will reproduce this article and let more people see it , so the header needs to attract attention .
The scheme behind this article is just one example ; I want to use it to inform everyone that things should be done with a clear objective , and they need to be thought out clearly beforehand .
What kind of results will this achieve ?
Describe it in detail and write it down .
This way , you'll 'll improve your efficiency in everything you do .
Of course this article does have considerable value ; it 's a summary of my 28 years of living and establishing a business , and what I say in it is not necessarily right , but I 'm confident that it can get you started .
A brief self - introduction .
My name is Pang Shengdong <http://pangshengdong.com/> .
I was born in 1977 into an ordinary peasant household in Tiantai , Zhejiang .
My mother was a peasant and my father was a carpenter ; they were both typical , solid country folk .
I got a job in 1998 ; I first wasted three years working in a public institution , and in 2001 I began setting up my own business ; I got things rolling , and I amassed a considerable amount .
In July of 2005 I invested in and established 51.com , serving as CEO .
51.com would provide a psychological harbor for millions of young Chinese females .
Starting from nothing , in six months ' time 51.com would enter the worldwide top 400 sites ; in 10 months ' time it entered the top 200 sites , and in 12 months ' time it was among the top 100 !
Now there are many risk investment companies expressing their clear intention to invest .
In my early years , I always believed that by relying on my smarts and effort I should eventually be able to live a pretty good life , but I never thought that when I was 28 I 'd be living in a fine home , be driving an Audi , have so many investors in my company , and have more than a hundred employees .
Many people ask me , Why ? Why are you able to make money ?
I ask myself the same question .
I need to sum it all up , to find out the reasons I can make money , to find out which qualities determined today 's achievements , to keep from slowly losing these qualities .
Why am I able to make money ?
Making money means letting other people give you money ; it 's selling things .
I made money because : I sold things to many people .
Why are there so many people who buy my things ?
If I look at it from this angle , and briefly sum it all up , the following are the main reasons :
1. Good character :
People 's outlook is bright ; if your everyday character is such that you are always thinking of other people , your things ca n't be too shoddy .
A good person finds it easier to design good things , and good service models .
I am a good person , I can say that with a clear conscience .
To date , no one has been able to surpass the securities service model I designed four years ago .
I think being a good person is the first reason I am able to make money .
2. Effort , progress , and constant study :
This is the basic quality for success ; there has never been any free lunch in the world , and since I graduated I've worked and studied 14 hours every day .
Pay attention to the concept of constant study ; regardless of what you do , you need to give it careful consideration , and you 'll gain an understanding of it ; any time is study time .
3. Dare to act !
Take no action , then there 's no opportunity for sure !
If you feel you can bear this risk , if you feel you can make do with the resources you have , then get cracking !
4. Luck : luck is also important .
Actually , now you can get the opportunity that this Internet provides , and everybody 's luck has gotten better .
Do n't say that this completely new , revolutionary application , this huge market , which has grown so fast , is entirely taken up by big companies ; do n't say the current situation is so disadvantageous .
Five years from now , when we look back at 2005 , we 'll say that these were good times created by the Internet .
5. Business flair and IQ :
My past business judgments demonstrate that I have a flair for business ; I think my business sense is pretty sharp .
6. Systematic thinking enables you to grasp the key points of any mater .
7. Strong cooperative awareness : nobody can do everything .
You need a team to make up for inadequacies in each person 's ability and experience .
In fact , I previously wrote a similar article , and everybody can search for it on Baidu or Google .
Eventually I may specially rewrite it to describe in detail how to find a business that will make money .
Everyone please note my blog on Donews http://blog.donews.com/pangshengdong .
What I say is not necessarily right , but I am confident that if you read it carefully it should give you a start .
Regarding everyone 's suggestions :
1. What you pay out you will get back .
Thinking more of other people , seeing things from their shoes : before you know it , we may also have the habits of good people , and this will raise our happiness index and our likelihood of succeeding .
Most successful people are good people !
2. People are naturally lazy , but if we want to succeed , if we want to make a lot of money , we need to think positively and make a greater effort !
Everybody has more or less the same IQ ; what can you use to make money ?
Hah ! Really make an effort !
At the same time , make sure you study constantly !
3. Remember : things are possible only when you act !
4. Business opportunities can be analyzed ; this requires a good model of thinking and adequate information .
How to analyze ?
Eventually I will write an article explaining this in detail .
5. Pay attention to teamwork ; one person can not achieve great things .
Always try to acquire friends who have abilities and experiences that complement yours .
If you want to establish a successful business , it 's extremely important to have several good partners .
6. Joining up with a good company is also a shortcut to getting rich ; many new companies are now hiring , and 51.com is currently hiring on a large scale <http://companyads.51job.com/companyads/shanghai/sh/shengdong_060627/i...> .
Everybody can also go read my blog ; that 's also a good opportunity .
You need to seize opportunities immediately , otherwise you may end up kicking yourself .
At the end of 2005 51.com will be listed among the 500 top companies on the Alexa Web site .
7. If you have a chance , interact with those who are actually successful .
Read what those who are really successful have written ; articles like this are hard to come by .
I urge everyone to read the new book written by Li Kaifu , the president of Google China ; the book by Li Jian , the president of Pinsou , is also not bad .
In short : as long as you make an effort , are willing to do it ! And pay attention to your methods , everybody has a chance to succeed !
Everybody has a chance to become a multimillionaire .

New Immigrant Ding Yunhong Sues Federal Government

Title : New Immigrant Ding Yunhong Sues Federal Government
Poster 's Site : mitbbs.com BBS -LRB- Fri Jan 5 13:41:01 2007 -RRB-
Ding Yunhong , who came from mainland China and then immigrated to Windsor , Ontario , by way of the US , will attend the public hearing for judgment on his accusation of the federal government at 10:00 a.m. next Monday -LRB- January 8 -RRB- at the federal appeal court in Toronto .
During Ding Yunhong 's application for citizenship , a CIC official accused him of violating the law such as going to the US without notification , failing to report children upon landing , and attending school while collecting unemployment benefits .
Ding Yunhong gave explanations and responses to these accusations one by one , believing that this government official 's abuse of power had constituted infringement of his rights protected by the Canadian constitution and laws .
After filing complaints with CIC several times with no results , Ding Yunhong filed a complaint against the Canadian government with the federal court in Toronto on July 22 , 2004 .
After receiving the complaint , the civil court prosecuted the case on October 1 , 2004 .
On December 3 of the same year , Ding Yunhong became a Canadian citizen .
However , he believed he had suffered enough humiliation and damage during the application process and therefore further filed his complaint with the federal appeal court to demand justice .
He said that getting involved in the lawsuit with the government and court had subjected him and his family to tremendous pains and that he had suffered long - term depression because of that , but he could not do nothing for any injustice and discrimination imposed on him and will continue to fight .

What is life ?
Carefree - like
A student in a university philosophy department started pondering the question of what is life .
But he asked everyone around him , and none of his teachers was able to answer him .
So he left the university and went looking for a wise man to ask .
After 10 years , he finally learned of a wise yogi deep in the mountains of India .
He thereupon set out on tortuous roads , crossing over towering mountain peaks , and finally he found this wise man .
The wise man was seated , with his eyes closed .
The student did n't dare startle him , so he simply waited from dawn until dusk , when the wise man opened his eyes slightly .
The student seized his chance and hastened to ask : What is life ?
The wise man 's gaze shifted slightly ; he looked far off into the mountains , and he said profoundly : Life is a river .
The flustered student sprang to his feet :
Right ! I did n't take a university course on philosophical enlightenment and come all this way to hear you say what some little kid might say !
What the hell is life ?
The wise man was greatly surprised ; he too jumped up and said : You mean ... life is n't a river ?

Title : Instead of Fighting among Ourselves , Think of Whether You have Actual Power to Seek Benefits for Chinese People
Poster 's Site : mitbbs.com BBS -LRB- Wed Jan 3 00:39:42 2007 -RRB-
At present , Chinese in the US are already an underrepresented group among the underrepresented groups .
Their actual power is far less than Indians ' .
Chinese people 's influence on the US politics and society is almost zero .
It can be said that they are typically subject to excessive humiliation -LRB- I did n't misuse the word , well - known US media can openly humiliate Chinese without having to worry about consequences -RRB- .
Under such circumstances , these self - proclaimed , so - called elites , graduates of China 's " famous " universities -LRB- Note , I mean China 's , there are n't many of those braggarts attending the famous US universities in which their departments are the top ten -RRB- , instead of thinking about how to get united , are getting themselves disabled first .
Assuming that you have achieved the best you have wanted , with only students from your respectful universities left in the US , what would be the result ?
Could things exist with their foundation gone ?
I guess your days would be also numbered .
Indians are waiting to reap profits from your conflict .
If you think I am exaggerating things to scare people , then shut up .
No more wasting your own and other people 's time out of boredom .
Be a student , or a researcher , what ultimately counts is the vision .
Nobel prizes are not given to highest scorers on the college entrance exams , but to those who can clearly point the direction in their chosen field .
Playing little clever tricks on minor issues , but blinded to major issues by trifles are not considered to be elites .
Elites at least should " not be muddle - headed in major affairs . "
Those who want to use abusive words , continue to do so .
Even if I would be drowned in your saliva , I still would like to speak for the Chinese compatriots who want to get united .
To put it impolitely , you people and your name will be both gone , while rivers will flow on forever .
In the end , whoever seeks benefits for the Chinese people will be respected by all .
This is not something that you can get through arguments .

Custom has it that you should not get your hair cut in the first month of the lunar year ,
And before the Spring Festival there are more people than usual getting their makeup and hair done .
Abing laughingly allowed me to go on the second day of the second month when the two dragons raise their heads to get my hair cut .
In the evening I had nothing to do , so I decided to look for someone to gamble with .
I called a friend , but he had just moved into a new home .
Today for leap - year day his father - and mother - in - law were gathered with his family at his house to make jiaozi , so it appears we ca n't get together for gambling today !
Tutu and I went home and ate a great meal , I lit some candles , and the two of us celebrated the holiday .
The custom of paying respects to the Kitchen God .
According to traditional custom , every year on the 23rd of the last month of the lunar year , the Kitchen God is supposed to ascend to Heaven and report to the Jade Emperor on this home 's good things and bad for the Jade Emperor to reward or punish .
So when they pray to the Kitchen God , people place sweets , fresh water , black beans , and hay on a table in front of the Kitchen God 's image ; the last three of these are for the horse that the Kitchen God rides to Heaven .
On the evening of the 23rd of the twelfth lunar month , you 're supposed to place a tray of candied melon on the table .
This is because you hope the Kitchen God will eat his fill of sweets and then " tell good things in Heaven and bring good fortune when he returns . "
After you put the candied melon on , you take down the image of the Kitchen God that was hung above the stove the previous year and burn it at the side of the stove ; then you wait until the 30th when you put up the spring couplets and hang a new Kitchen God in the original place , and you hang up a couplet with the first line saying " Ascend to Heaven and tell good things " and the second line reading " Return and bring good fortune , " and the horizontal saying is " Ruler of This Home . "
Then you also put an incense burner there and every time you celebrate a festival you light incense and pray for happiness .
Folk custom says that men do not worship the moon and women do not sacrifice to the Kitchen God , so it is only the men who make these sacrifices to the Kitchen God .
Legend .
A long time ago , there was a well - to - do family named Zhang ; in middle age , they had a son .
The husband and wife gave their son the name Zhang Guisheng , and later people called him Zhang Sheng .
When Zhang Sheng grew up , he liked to eat , was lazy , and he often went gambling , so the old husband and wife decided to marry him off and let their daughter - in - law manage him .
They sent someone to propose this marriage to a comely girl in the village named Guo Dingxiang .
Dingxiang soon came to live with them , but after the marriage Zhang Sheng 's behavior worsened .
Dingxiang persuaded and cajoled , but in the end she was beaten and kicked by Zhang Sheng .
Not long after , the two aggrieved elders passed on .
One day , Dingxiang rolled out a bowlful of long , fine noodles and waited for Zhang Sheng to return to eat , and she took the opportunity to again urge him to change his ways , but Zhang Sheng pushed the bowl away and left .
After this , Zhang Sheng threw out Dingxiang , sold off the family possessions and land , and spent his days living a life of dissipation .
After being thrown out , Dingxiang went to South Mountain .
There she spent her days clearing land and planting crops , and in the evening she wove ; after years of arduous toil , she became a wealthy woman with a hundred mu of fine land .
When Zhang Sheng had sold off all his possessions , he began to beg for a living .
Only then did he repent , and he thought of how worthy Dingxiang was .
One day , Dingxiang saw a beggar enter her courtyard , and she realized it was Zhang Sheng .
Good - hearted Dingxiang took Zhang Sheng into the kitchen and with her own hands gave him a bowl , setting it on the table .
Zhang Sheng saw this bowl of long , thin noodles and knew he had come begging to Dingxiang 's home ; feeling ashamed , he smashed his head into the stove and killed himself .
Later the Jade Emperor made him the Kitchen God and put him above the stove so he could watch other people eat but not eat himself , and told him that was his punishment .

Topic : In Terms of Blood Lines , Little Japan Is Closer to China
Posting station : BBS Unnamed space station -LRB- Thu Feb 1 23:53:45 2007 -RRB- .
Half of the Japanese people are descendants of the Han race -LRB- proved by modern genetics -RRB- , and they inherited their culture from us as well .
More or less they can somehow talk practically and realistically .
Before the year N , most Koreans were the descendants of northwestern nomads ; they were pressured by the Han for N years , and they bear animosity .
If in those years the " Great East Asian Circle of Common Glory " is unfortunately achieved , it should be a bit more bearable than in the Qing Dynasty when the Manchus shaved our heads .
For the long - term , if we let the descendants of the overseas Han come to force the Great East Asian Circle of Glory , it wo n't be as good as if we make it happen ourselves .
Then we 'll send troops to be stationed in Korea and follow the system of the Manchus from those times , setting up a frankpledge system , with the bride spending her wedding night with the lord of the frankpledge .
Restoring those olden days will ensure that everybody on the Korean peninsula is a descendant of the Han race , ^_^ .

Setting up an Internet business : What do you need ?

Setting up an Internet business : What do you need ?
Experience in setting up a business : My " boss " dream
Three stages of setting up a business from scratch
The critical path of success
Talking about setting up a business
Now , as the Internet grows , the Internet economy has passed through a " bubble era " and is gradually moving toward a dazzling springtime .
When you look at the IT giants that have sprouted up one after the other on the Internet , do you get excited ?
Are you worried ?
Are you determined ?
Setting up an Internet business is an idea that appeals to people .
Because : 1. Low cost
Unless they are undertaking a very large project , Internet entrepreneurs do not need much capital .
Perhaps one computer + ADSL + a dummy mainframe + a small room and you can get started .
But this is still far , far from success .
Some people may scoff that this ca n't be called setting up a business .
If you have plenty of funds , very sharp thinking , and a classic idea , you do n't need to read what I wrote .
But do n't stick up your nose ; for the time being we 're not talking about the relationship between capital and profit .
You feel that if the cost is insignificant , the profit must not be worth mentioning .
Well , now I 'm telling you you're 're wrong .
This traditional cost - profit relationship just does n't work on the Internet .
Because you 've overlooked one thing , and that 's your own intelligence and ability .
In setting up an Internet business , this holds a more important position .
The Internet is absolutely a place for the daring to be forceful .
If you have the ability , you can hope to succeed .
2. Low start - up cost
Internet communications are now well developed .
It can be said that all you need is broadband , and you 've solved most of your Internet communication problems and can save yourself a lot of telephone charges .
At the same time , you do n't need to go out and rent a storefront and pay exorbitant rents .
Early on , before you 've formally registered the company , you also do n't have to be bothered with lots of petty charges and taxes .
3. Staffing is very simple ; in the early stages many entrepreneurs start from scratch , with one person handling all tasks .
Because one person can basically cope with everything in the early stages , there is no need to incur personnel costs .
4. The risk is low , so if the business fails , you do n't need to be afraid .
Because the initial investment is low , there are greater opportunities for turnover .
Therefore the entrepreneur can give up without fearing the consequences of failure .
5. High profit
If you succeed early on in setting up your business and continue on down the right path of development , then I congratulate you .
Now you can shout it out : " My Web site is making a profit ! "
But do n't let the first bucket of money you make go to your head .
Do n't forget , the higher you climb , the higher you 'll fall .
Remind yourself that now is the time you need to keep a close watch on developments in market trends and among your competitors .
Promptly adjust your growth strategy .
Only then will you be smiling at the end .
Maybe when you read about the advantages of establishing an Internet business above , your heart was racing and you were thinking you 'd really work hard to make it .
Below I 'm going to discuss some of the areas that you need to pay attention to when setting up an Internet business :
1. Use your own unique vision to examine the Internet and look for new ways to make a profit .
Aggressively investigate new projects ; avoid blindly imitating others .
Are there lots of people doing this kind of thing on the Internet ?
If a flashA.com appears on the Net today , tomorrow there will be flashC.com and flashD.com .
If that 's the case , your odds of failing just increased by 30 % .
Remember : If you 're always following on somebody else 's tail , then what you'll get will always be someone else 's trash , picked over , cast aside and unused .
Of course we 're not opposed to imitating , but what we should think about is why is this person taking that route , and not which route is this person taking .
Then we will study the line of thought and the skills he used to solve problems .
So we will gain more than he did .
2. If you 've selected a given project and are carrying it out , then you should definitely carry it through to the end ; avoid switching course in midstream .
Of course when I say see it through to the end , this does not mean to continue blindly , sticking with it even when you know full well it 's hopeless .
What I mean is , do n't be distracted , doing SMS today and selling things tomorrow , with a new approach every day .
You see somebody else doing something that makes money , and you think you want to do that .
Your website is simply the " art of changing your look " like in Sichuan opera .
A new face every day , completely different .
What I recommend is that when you set up your business you should give it careful consideration and fully investigate its feasibility .
Once you set out to do something , you should pursue the goal you set for yourself , sticking with it unless really forced to give up .
3. Use your hands , eyes and brain , be observant and alert , and consider all possibilities .
Avoid acting rashly when you set up your Internet business .
Your mind needs to be sharp ; the Internet offers virtually unlimited business opportunities ; maybe it 's just a small opportunity , but you should seize it .
Then maybe you will succeed .
Otherwise if the opportunity was right in front of you and you did n't seize it .
So ... you need nimble hands .
If you come upon something important , by all means make a note of it , and so on .
Your eyes need to be sharp : you need to spot changes in the IT situation right away and quickly prepare a short - term business plan .
Like right now , many portal sites are seizing the opportunity of the Olympics to considerably increase their traffic .
I think advertising revenues in this area alone will be considerable .
4. Be tough and resilient : avoid the easy route .
Setting up an Internet business is hard labor .
When you 're just setting up your business , it is sometimes hard to avoid feeling completely exhausted .
Sometimes you 'll just feel like throwing in the towel .
Do n't forget : if you were working for someone else , you would n't like it either , and may feel even worse !
5. You need to learn to look for partners .
6. You need to know what Internet marketing is , and learn how to use it .
Are you looking for an already proven , feasible way to increase your sources of income ?
Are you looking for an opportunity to create both free time and financial freedom ?
Do you have dreams or goals that you want to reach ?

China is Capable of withstanding the Impacts Brought to China by US Economic Recession .

Source : changbaishan , Jan 10 , 2007 12:58:27 AM .
China is Capable of withstanding the Impacts Brought to China by US Economic Recession .
Following the recession in 2001 , the US economy has entered into " soft - landing " adjustment after five years of continuous expansion .
Some expect that in 2007 the US economic growth rate will drop to 1.9 - 2.5 percent , the interest rate will drop to 4 percent , and the US dollar will continue to depreciate .
Once the US economy is in recession , will impacts will it bring to China ?
And what measures will China take in response ?
These are questions worth pondering upon .
Pressure brought to China by the US economic recession .
The United States is the powerhouse of the world economy and the largest international market .
The USD$ 800 - billion annual trade deficit indicates global exports are heavily dependent on the US .
The US is our No. 2 trade partner , No. 1 export market , No. 6 import source , and No. 3 technology import source .
China 's total export value was USD $ 875 billion from January to November 2006 , of which 21 % was export to the US .
Plus the portion re-exported from Hong Kong , export to the US accounted for over 35 percent of the total Chinese export value .
Export of Chinese shipping , low - end electronics , furniture , textiles and artware could all be affected should the US experience economic recession .
In addition , other developing countries in Asia are major suppliers in the supply chain centered around China , and the supply chain is driven by the US demand .
As a result , slowdown of the US economy represents a huge pressure for the entire Asia .
Some expect that China 's export growth rate will decrease from 23 percent to 15 percent in 2007 .
If the government sit by and watch , the Chinese economic growth rate will drop 3 - 4 percent .
China is fully capable of withstanding the impacts .
Regardless of the accuracy of various comments , China must be prepared to cope with the US economic recession .
Although some predictions are a little sensational , the author believes the US economic recession this time will not be very severe , with less impacts on China than other countries .
By taking some proactive measures , the Chinese economy is fully capable of withstanding such impacts .
From the current situation , strong domestic investment within China has fully compensated the impact of the decrease in net export .
The appreciation of RMB has not affected export either , and the decrease in volume due to higher prices is offset by increased prices .
Raw materials imported take a large percentage in the costs of the Chinese exports .
The appreciation of RMB could , in the first place , lower costs .
Additionally , in the long term , RMB slowly edging up can encourage firms to use advanced international technology and resources .
The government may support export , especially technological upgrade of exports , by such ways as increasing export rebates , adopting quicker depreciation , removing the super-national treatment to foreign investments .
It can be expected that neither the appreciation of RMB nor the global economic recession will seriously impact Chinese export .
It would be exaggerating to say China is 70 percent dependent on foreign trade .
The statistics has underestimated China 's Gross National Product -LRB- GNP -RRB- , especially that of the tertiary sector .
Converting to US dollar at the exchange rate has also underestimated China 's Gross Domestic Product -LRB- GDP -RRB- .
As more than half of the Chinese foreign trade is processing trade , it would be overestimating the total foreign trade to count import and export repeatedly .
The author estimates that our country actually might be 40 percent dependent on foreign trade .
Therefore , there is no need to magnify China 's dependence on export to the US .
Export - oriented economic growth of China should be cooled down , while the role of domestic demand and import should be promoted .
Our economic growth relies primarily on the domestic market and should be increasingly dependent on the domestic market .
If factors such as the rapid development of the tertiary sector and the appreciation of RMB are taken into consideration , China 's dependence on foreign trade can be controlled at around 50 percent in the long run .
Long - term export of Chinese products at low prices will lead to " impoverished wealth growth , " and we should specially understand the " wealth " as domestic environmental resources .
Foreign - funded processing export consumes domestic electricity and water resources substantially .
The environmental costs in our country account for approximately 30 percent of product costs , but are not incorporated into product prices .
And this is the primary reason why Chinese products are cheap .
It is imperative to remove the environmental subsidies to domestic and foreign consumers , internalize external environmental costs of Chinese products as soon as possible , and increase the prices of most products , including exports , in order to alleviate international trade frictions , reduce the pressure for RMB appreciation , and in particular change the prospect that the Chinese environmental resources will seriously deteriorate .
In addition , the Chinese population is huge and young , which enables the Chinese economy to enjoy the " population dividends . "
However , the percentage of savings is astoundingly high , and according to the hypothesis of macroeconomic balance where savings equal investments , the huge investments have become the source of high - speed economic development .
However , to depress the consumption rate to lower than 40 percent will certainly lead to overproduction , and cheap goods will in turn impact the international market .
If the US economic recession would indeed affect our export , it would not necessarily be a bad thing in the author 's view .
In a sense , domestic demand will not increase unless export decreases .
Over the last 20 years , the world has experienced many economic crashes , affecting countries or regions such as Russia , Arab , Latin America and East Asia .
The US also suffered stock market crash in 2001 .
China is the only one to realize economic emergence for the largest population in the history .
Whenever there is an international economic recession , China would actively expand domestic demand to create market for different countries .
In fact , China has long been a responsible big nation , playing a stabilizing role to the international society .
External pressure is an opportunity for internal restructuring .
Long - term high - speed growth in China has led to significant wealth growth , as well as different kinds of disequilibriums , such as : too much savings and investments and insufficient consumptions ; heavy investment in infrastructure and manufacturing , and insufficient investment in national defense , science and technology , education , health , environment and national reserves ; wider income gap , regional gap and gap between urban and rural areas ; the economy has become dependent on the US market to some extent due to long - term export orientation and trade surplus to the United States ; and environmental resource outflow by way of exporting , so on and so forth .
By now , high - speed growth of the Chinese economy has entered the final acceleration period that will span over a decade .
Beginning 2007 , the economic aggregate is expected to increase sharply by 150 percent , leading to the " historical disequilibrium development " predicted by Soros .
This is also why China is not afraid of a global economic crisis and capable of digesting it .
However , after 2020 , China will be facing the puzzle of population aging , which is sure to witness an economic slowdown .
As an expectation , there will be leading overreactions in financial and real estate areas by around 2015 .
We must complete a series of tasks in this period , including system restructuring , overcoming the financial crisis , improving national defense strength , safeguarding national security , realizing technological upgrade and protecting the environment .
The economic growth in future will be realized primarily through technological advancement and social harmony .
Within these years , the sharply grown wealth of RMB? 40 trillion shall be used effectively in areas including national defense , science and technology , environment , national soil renovation , and adjusting social relations .
It wo n't do to rely solely on the market mechanism and economic strength .
To realize , there should also be a correct strategy , relying upon the comprehensive strength of the culture , the nation and the society .
Various disequilibriums in the rapid growth of China must be adjusted .
From this perspective , the US economic recession imposes external pressure on the economic restructuring , which is also an opportunity .
Whether the impacts brought to China by the US economic recession can be resisted and the impacts on the world economy can be alleviated hinge on whether or not China can truly expand its domestic demand .
The next few years may see the Chinese economy cooling down , a continuous modest rise in RMB , a slowdown in the speed and volume of export growth , a possible decrease in trade surplus , and speculative capital and the real estate bubble in control , which are adjustments from disequilibriums to equilibriums in the economic relations between China and the United States and between China and the world , as well as in the social relations within China .

Peasants blocking roads and clashing with the police : who should reflect on this ?
613305
-LSB- Xinhua , Jiu Taiping -RSB- posted on January 14 , 2007 2:00:25 p.m. -LRB- SMS -RSB- -- -LSB- Outer form -RSB- .
Jiu Taiping
" Rocks were moved onto the road , and several dozen peasants stood in the middle of the road , several hundred cars were backed up , and rocks were thrown at the police .... "
Yesterday morning after 10:00 o'clock , villagers from some 40 households in Zhaojiacun , Xiaojie Township , Chongming County , unhappy with the blasting for road construction that was damaging their homes , crowded onto the section at the 67th kilometer of Kunqu highway now being built , throwing stones and blocking the road for more than four hours , causing a backup of hundreds of cars .
-LRB- January 14 , Capital City News -RRB- .
It is unreasonable to block roads and cut off traffic even if the villagers ' homes were being damaged by the blasting for road construction and the economy was being hurt ; these methods are illegal and harm innocent bystanders ; they are unacceptable .
If there is a problem , they should seek out the concerned departments , that 's all .
However , the villagers ' agitation has its own reasons .
You might say it ca n't be helped .
If they had been able to resolve the problem through regular channels , they would n't have taken such a step .
China 's peasants are simple and decent folk ; quite often when they get the short end of the stick they suffer in silence .
If it is not something that affects their livelihood , they are not easily moved to take action .
They may be simple and decent and may accept bullying , but when someone rides on their backs and dumps on them , they wo n't take it any more , and they explode .
In my view , the concerned parties ' disregard for the people 's interests is the basic reason that brought this on .
At the same time , in this disturbance both the villagers and the police are the victims of bureaucracy .
In the news reports , we clearly felt that the behavior of the police went beyond enforcement of the law ; their behavior infringed on human rights .
For example , when the dustup began between the people and the police , " One policeman took out a camera and photographed me ; I used my hand to block it , and another policeman kicked me in the stomach .
I immediately squatted down , and then they beat me on the face and head , I do n't know who it was ; I wiped my face with my hand , my hand was full of blood , they had broken open my mouth . "
Although the peasants ' blocking the road was against the law , the police can maintain order according to the law ,
but what right do the police have to beat people and even to kick a woman in the stomach ? "
It also might be said that when a mob situation arises the police do n't want to clash with the people ; most often the police are following orders to suppress the mob and help officials restore order .
In life , some local government officials encounter problems of fierce resistance from the people ; instead of thinking of ways to smooth over and resolve the problem , they first think of suppressing it , and they 're accustomed to mobilizing the police force to forcefully carry that out .
In fact the harsher the suppression the more likely there will be a conflict , bringing on even greater feelings of opposition between police and people and between cadres and the masses , which does n't help resolve the problem .
Taking this case as an example , the common folk blocked the road because the local government did not resolve the problem .
If it had resolved it , no one would have broken the law !
Although you can say that blocking the road was illegal , it 's also not a violent act ; the police should have continued directing traffic , and they might not have resorted so quickly to force .
Who brought about the clash between the police and the villagers ?
Who bears responsibility ?!
I believe we should first look into the local government 's nonfeasance in ignoring the interests of the people .
" The interests of the masses are no small matter " is not just a slogan ; it needs to be made real .
Now that there has been this disturbance , the concerned parties need to be vigilant ; they take the initiative and pay compensation for the reinforcement work , sooner rather than later .
The reason is very simple : people 's homes , which were originally unstable , can still be maintained for several more years ; this shock was n't caused by the people , and compensation should be paid .
Moreover , it is useless to quibble further about how much money should be spent on the compensation issue .
I believe there is only one standard : if someone 's house was destroyed , the party who destroyed it should restore it to its original condition , without regard to how much money the damage is worth , afraid to spend one red cent ; just restore it to the original condition .
If the wrangling over the compensation issue goes on forever , then I believe the government is still not sincere in resolving the matter of the people 's interests ; if it drags on and on , it will only intensify the conflict and make the people angry , and history will repeat itself .
Do , keep bullying the peasants ; they have it tough enough !
The peasants have suffered enough !
Give them the means to live !
" Appeal from a Communist " and " Death " Threat to the Reporter .

" Appeal from a Communist " and " Death " Threat to the Reporter .
An Appeal from a communist at the Fenghua Garden community .
Fenghua Garden residents : .
Weird things have persisted since we moved into the Fenghua Garden .
Over the past years , the media , procuratorate , court and government are all involved in the issue of Fenghua Garden .
Instead of any solutions to the issue , we can vaguely see all sorts of mysteries of politics .
This gives us nothing but confusions and concerns .
How could there be such a weird phenomenon under the communist leadership ?
We are puzzled !
After seeing the remarks of an auditor - general , I am finally a little enlightened on the mysteries of the " Fenghua Garden phenomenon . "
The insightful opinion of this insightful person is indeed penetrating , " there is no law - abiding community association in Xuzhou . "
This is the auditor 's conclusion from the auditor - general after auditing the embezzlement of Fenghua Garden properties by the Community Association , which says there is no law - abiding community association .
Therefore , be it embezzlement or robbery , there 's no surprise .
God ! It really makes you tremble with fear when such words are uttered by a communist official specializing in auditing .
How are the fundamental purposes of the Chinese Communist Party implemented among officials , media , procuratorate , court and government in Xuzhou ?
No wonder the media are afraid of releasing the actual situation at the Fenghua Garden .
You , leaders of the legal and political communities educated by the Party , do n't you feel the severity of the problem ?
The community association is a grass - root organization of the Party , which also hosts the Party Branch .
The community association does not obey the law , and even deliberately break the law , seizing and looting properties of residents and people and beating others in retaliation , coupled with the police 's involvement in beating others .
These have deeply hurt people 's hearts and will lead to a loss of support of people over time .
This is a major issue crucial to the life and death of the Party and the nation , which no communists or righteous Chinese should turn a blind eye to .
Specifically , communists and righteous and integral people at the Fenghua Garden should no longer keep silent .
We appeal to Secretary Xu Ming to address issue of the Fenghua Garden , as well as the issue that " there is no law - abiding community association in Xuzhou " promptly .
If it drags on again without solution , we should appeal to Secretary Li Yuanchao of the Provincial Committee , up to the Central Committee , with liabilities of leaders at various levels investigated .
Everyone is called upon for uniform action .
A communist , January 6 , 2007
Wang Peirong received " death " threat for as long as a week .
Director of the Owner Committee , Wang Peirong , insisted on reporting and revealing publicly the illegal behaviors such as embezzlement and appropriation of public properties of the owners .
The action of Wang Peirong has stood in the way of some people to become rich and smashed the millionaire dream of some people in their attempt to embezzle and appropriate public properties , and so they hate Wang Peirong to the guts .
Recently , wife of Wang Guanghua , Deputy - Secretary of the Community Party Branch , has written more than once on the community notice board such things as " Wang Peirong is on a no - return road , " issuing open " death " threat to Wang Peirong .
Wang Peirong has reported to the police many times since January 4 , but Wang Guanghua 's wife exercised no restraint , and instead she wrote the " death " threat on Wang Peirong 's unit entrance on the 8th .
The fact that Wang Guanghua 's wife had the nerve to issue " death " threat to the reporter Wang Peirong for a week is associated with the public security 's failure to investigate the case that the reporter Wang Peirong was bashed up by four family members of Liu Yongxiu , Director of the Fenghua Garden Community Association .
With the reporter 's rights not guaranteed , law - breakers , criminals and the corrupt have no fear and retaliate upon the reporter .
The evil force is rampant at the Fenghua Garden community , Xuzhou .
With stolen authorities , they have embezzled and appropriated public properties of the owners by hook or crook and sought a protection layer through bribery .
They beat up the reporter and issued " death " threat .
This is not only an open provocation to the reporter Wang Peirong , but also an open provocation to owners at the Fenghua Garden , as well as an open provocation to the social legal system , which serious deteriorate the social atmosphere .
January 8 , 2007 .
Corruption is astounding in Xuzhou , with the corrupt committing all kinds of crimes blatantly .
The struggle against corruption makes little progress as it takes both blood and tears .
Corruption is astounding in Xuzhou , with the corrupt committing all kinds of crimes blatantly .

Originating site : BBS Unknown Space -LRB- Sun Jan 21 21:10:52 2007 -RRB- .
In principle , I am already in my thirties and turning forty anyhow , but I am still disgusted upon seeing it .
I am not sure if Cui fucked a minor .
If he was my friend , I will most probably avoid contacting him until he cleans it off .
People have bottom lines after all .
Some things are absolutely unacceptable , like murder , like fucking a minor .
When I was back in China this year , I tutored little girls at two relatives homes , feeling 14 - 17 is a very dangerous age group for girls .
You can see clearly how she considers problems , and she easily opens up her thoughts and emotions to you , .
where the worst is she thinks she understands everything .
Only rascals would harm these people .
You will understand what I mean if you have a daughter .
There are something that I will never understand , for example having sexual impulse for girls between 14 and 17 .
It only makes me feel funny and concerned to know their various naive and innocent thoughts , as well as their virtually groundless admiration for and trust in you .
Who will harm these people ?
When I just met my wife , she was a volunteer at some women 's organizations .
I also went for help and met a lot of single mothers discarded , or even tortured by men .
Many ideas have changed .
People can be very bad , while simultaneously they are decent lawyers , doctors , professors and engineers .
Many people/matters make you hard to believe .
Some people are just like the colleagues and teachers around you , but they have done very contemptible things , which could be said even worse than beasts .
In the past , I always thought many laws and regulations were ridiculous in the United States , but I feel they are quite reasonable after experiencing these .
In order to protect the weak , it is necessary for the powerful to sacrifice some interests or conveniences .
After all , the so - called " sacrifices " are no big deal , while the disasters endured by the weak are much heavier .
Please guard your moral bottom line , even if you do not have a teenage daughter .

Territories are conquered , while affections are nurtured ! .

[buabua] Zhong Dajun : China 's Economy is Very " Heavy "
[buabua] With regard to China 's development , for most workers and farmers , the fruit of economic development is like a black hole .
[buabua] Why has n't there been substantial change in the living conditions of most common people after nearly 30 years of reform ?
Many people are even still living in poverty .
[buabua] Where is the national wealth created by such a high economic growth ?
[buabua] High Economic Growth and Big Wealth Funnel -- Several Obvious Features of the Current Economy of Our Country
[buabua] Zhong Dajun , Beijing Dajun Economic Observation & Research Center
[buabua] The current situation of economic development in our country makes us both happy and worried .
We are happy because we have a government and the people who are greatly interested in GDP and developing economy enthusiastically .
And we are worried because the global division of labor has led to an abnormal industrial structure , and corruption has caused [buabua] the loss of economic development achievements .
[buabua] To sum up , China 's current economy has many features , but today I would like to talk mainly about these four points .
[buabua] I. the large investment scale of 32 trillion
[buabua] The first feature is certainly the high economic growth and large investment scale .
[buabua] Over these years , our country has been a country with unusually high economic growth in the world , and its achievements in construction often surprise the people from developed countries .
[buabua] For example , the construction of the Water Cube Swimming Center of the Beijing Olympic Stadium in today 's news report can be called the world first class .
[buabua] Of course , the high economic growth of our country is mainly driven by high investment .
[buabua] According to the new data announced by statistics department a few days ago , the investment projects under construction have totaled 32 trillion yuan in our country at present , 7 trillion more than last year 's 25 trillion .
[buabua] Thirty - two trillion yuan , converted into US dollars , is around 4 trillion US dollars .
[buabua] When the Japanese journalists had an interview with me a few days ago , I said to them , which country in the world has such a large construction scale at present ?
[buabua] With regard to the issue of the RMB exchange rate , to calculate based on PPP Standards , the total economic value and the construction scale of China should be absolutely far more than this .
[buabua] In the whole year of 2006 , the total investment in fixed assets of our country may reach 10 trillion yuan , increasing by approximately 30 % compared with the previous year .
[buabua] Scenes of booming construction can be seen everywhere in our country at present .
This is something to be happy about .
[buabua] For example , Beijing plans to increase the length of its subway to 550 km by 2020 , which will surpass that of New York , the USA , to become the No. 1 in the world .
However , at least several hundred billion yuan will be needed for this project .
[buabua] A large number of big and small metro projects throughout the country have formed the huge invested construction scale of our country .
[buabua] Currently the investments in our country are mainly spent on three major areas including infrastructure , enterprise facilities and real estate .
From these aspects , this wave of economic construction in our country is far from completion .
[buabua] Let 's look at infrastructure first .
In terms of various indexes such as railway , highway and communications , there is a certain disparity between our country and developed countries .
[buabua] In the example of Beijing Metro I mentioned above , the length of the subway in Beijing is less than 100 km at present , which is still far from 550 km .
[buabua] As for how many metros will be constructed in the whole country , there will be at least ten thousand kilometers .
[buabua] To calculate the cost at 500 million yuan per kilometer , an investment of five or six trillion yuan will be needed .
[buabua] In addition the construction of real estate can hardly cool down within two or three years .
The investment in real estate accounts for about 20 % of the total investment in fixed assets , and the investment amount this year is estimated to reach 18 trillion yuan , increasing by approximately 25 % year - on - year , but it is relatively low compared with other industries .
[buabua] With an annual fund investment of more than one trillion yuan , construction of so many buildings is a piece of good news for improvement of Chinese people 's residence and office conditions .
[buabua] Over the recent years , more than 300 million square meters of building area has been increased each year in our country , and per capita housing average has been increasing .
It is estimated that China can basically step out of the housing bottleneck and enter into oversupply period in a few years .
[buabua] But in the area of enterprises , China has just started to catch up with developed countries .
[buabua] If the industrialization of our country in the 1980s and 1990s was only the industrialization in light industry and household electric appliance industry , then the industrialization in our country has entered into the stage of heavy chemical industry since the 21st century .
[buabua] Development during this stage mainly concentrates on large equipment and machinery industry .
[buabua] These days , TV news is reporting that an enterprise in Shanxi has manufactured a large excavator for coal mining .
This shows that Chinese enterprises are finally starting to tackle large machinery .
[buabua] Some news even said that China has started preparing to manufacture 100,000 - ton aircraft carriers .
In fact , in the field of ship building industry , China has already had the capacity and conditions to manufacture aircraft carriers .
[buabua] Next , China will independently design and manufacture complete sets of equipment for large - scale enterprises in the heavy chemical industry .
[buabua] Only when China is able to produce such large key equipment by itself can China reverse the development mode of mercantilism as well as get rid of the fate of being in the processing trade as the world factory .
[buabua] China is stepping into modernization , and high speed is needed by the development of the country .
As long as the development is reasonable , a growth rate of 10 % is not high .
The key is to understand and solve the following problems .
[buabua] II. China 's economy is very " heavy . "
[buabua] At present the second feature of the economy in our country is " heaviness , " and such situation is caused by two major reasons .
[buabua] Firstly , our country is at the times of hardware construction and must be dealing with materials such as land , wood , steel and cement .
[buabua] Secondly , our country is entering into the stage of heavy chemical industry development .
As we become increasingly competitive , we are competing more successfully for the industries that developed countries were engaged in before , and in the meantime , developed countries are shifting to us the heavy chemical industry that they do not want to be engaged in .
[buabua] Two major sectors , " knowledge - based industry " and " material - based industry , " have emerged during the current world development .
Developed countries are increasingly entering into " knowledge - based industry " while developing countries are mostly entering into " material - based industry . "
[buabua] The knowledge - based industry is weightless , clean and environment - friendly with high added value .
[buabua] The material - based industry is heavy , tangible and pollutant with low added value .
[buabua] Such features make the present economic activities in our country particularly heavy .
[buabua] These years a saying has been circulating in our country that China has consumed 30 % of the steel , 40 % of the cement , and 30 % of the coal in the world but only has produced 4 % of its GDP .
[buabua] Such huge consumption of energy resources and raw materials only created such a small GDP .
It indicates the feature of " heaviness " of our economy .
The volume is heavy , but the value is low .
[buabua] Such feature has also resulted in soaring prices of energies and raw materials in the world in recent years .
[buabua] The international markets have been aware of China 's needs and taken this opportunity to raise prices .
Of course , China will go on with the development anyway , because there is in fact a considerable disparity between developed countries and us .
[buabua] We can see the disparity between our country and the US in hardware construction by giving an example .
[buabua] In the 100 years of the last century , the US produced and consumed 8.4 billion metric tons of steel in total , but it was only 1.8 billion metric tons for our country .
The disparity between the two countries is more than 6 billion metric tons .
[buabua] Both countries cover an area of more than 900 square kilometers , however the reinforced concrete cast in the US land might be several times more than in China in terms of the per capita amount , and it may take China many years to catch up with the infrastructure alone .
[buabua] Even if China produces 500 million metric tons of steel each year in the future , it will still take about 15 - 20 years to fill the gap .
[buabua] In particular , in terms of industrial structure , the developed countries have currently walked out of the stage of heavy chemical industry in succession , the industries in developed countries begin to become " light , " and their heavy chemical industries are gradually shifted to developing countries like China .
[buabua] China is in no position to pick and choose but take over the industries abandoned by others .
This makes the industrial structure of China very " heavy " during the whole process of global division of labor .
[buabua] If China becomes the manufacture workshop of the world 's heavy chemical industry in the next 20 years , the outcome will be quite different from today .
[buabua] At present , most of the import and export trade of our country is in processed products .
[buabua] When heavy chemical industrial products become the main import and export products of our country in the future , a great change will again take place in the economic structure and the import and export trade of our country .
The feature of " heaviness " of economic activities will be very obvious .
[buabua] I recalled the year 2001 when the Internet craze and knowledge - based economy craze appeared at home and abroad , some people getting so excited believed that China could rely on the Internet alone in the future .
[buabua] I could n't help throwing cold water on them by writing an article , saying that China would still stay at the stage of civil construction and steel economy in the future .
[buabua] Now when I look back on it , it becomes clearer .
[buabua] In sum , dealing with material - based economy will be what Chinese people are going to do for a long historical stage in the future .
This , of course , will have to consume a large amount of land resources and environment resources .
[buabua] China will face serious crisis of environment resources .
[buabua] Therefore , China should take a two - way approach in the future by paying attention to both material - based industry and knowledge - based economy .
Never be tricked by the theory of global labor division .
[buabua] III. A relatively large wealth funnel exists in China 's economy .
[buabua] Although the Chinese economy is growing rapidly , the distribution of national wealth is unbalanced , and a large disparity exists in the living conditions of citizens .
[buabua] In particular , when compared internationally , people find that a relatively large wealth funnel exists in the growth of China 's economy .
[buabua] For example , in Japan and South Korea , the rapid economic growth lasted less than 20 years , and their annual growth rates were lower than China 's , but these countries very quickly entered the ranks of the developed countries .
[buabua] In Japan during the period from the 1950s to the 1980s , the annual salary increase rate was 70 % higher than in the US , and the salary level had caught up with the US within less than 30 years .
[buabua] With regard to the development of our country , for most workers and farmers , the achievements of economic development are like a black hole .
[buabua] Why has n't there been substantial change in the living conditions of most common people after nearly 30 years of reform ?
Many people are even still living in poverty .
[buabua] Where is the national wealth created by such a high economic growth ?
[buabua] In spite of the numerous skyscrapers under construction in various large cities today , some of those luxurious facilities have nothing to do with Chinese people .
[buabua] A lot of assets and wealth in China do not belong to Chinese people .
[buabua] At present , the GDP -LRB- gross domestic product -RRB- of our country has reached over 20 trillion , but at least 40 % belongs to foreigners .
[buabua] Thus , the phenomena of the high economic growth , the low income of people , and the large outflow of profits have emerged during the development of China .
[buabua] This situation makes many people question the economic development of our country : where did the achievements of development go ?
[buabua] In my opinion , the wealth funnel in China 's economic development lies in four areas .
[buabua] Firstly , the large amount of exports has resulted in an outflow of resources and national wealth at a low price .
[buabua] Secondly , the large introduction of foreign capital has also resulted in the large outflow of profits .
[buabua] Thirdly , the huge amounts of unreported incomes derived from special rights and corruption are finding their way to foreign countries through diverse channels .
[buabua] Fourthly , the low efficiency and low returns of state - owned enterprises have also wasted a large amount of national wealth .
[buabua] The problems in these four areas have caused the rapid development and quick loss of China 's economy at the same time .
[buabua] Therefore , in a country that only pays attention to economic growth but neglects political reform , the effects of economic development will be questionable in the end .
[buabua] But today , this issue is just being put forward , and it will become clearer and more obvious in the future .
[buabua] Regarding this point , some problems can be explained by providing only one figure .
[buabua] During the period of more than 20 years since the reform and opening - up , the unreported income from property rental has been a huge number .
[buabua] In the 1990s , the economist Hu Heli et al. did the calculation and found that the discrepancies in prices , exchange currencies , and interests as well as other rentals amounted to 456.9 billion yuan in 1988 , accounting for 40 % of the GNP -LRB- 1,173.8 billion yuan -RRB- of that year .
[buabua] Recently , Gao Huiqing et al. of the State Information Center made the calculation and found that in 2004 the amount of rent from property rentals in the whole country reached 4.6 trillion yuan , accounting for 29 % of the GNP of that year , which was equivalent to 1.5 times the national fiscal revenue of that year , and 2.3 times the national salary income of that year .
[buabua] No matter how inaccurate these figures might be , they show a problem : there are a lot of unfair and unequal incomes in our country , and this has enabled a number of people to easily obtain a huge amount of wealth and has also given rise to corruption .
[buabua] Since our country is a backward developing country , those who get rich first are always likely to migrate to developed countries .
[buabua] This has taken away a lot of wealth from our country .
As a result , a regular phenomenon has occurred in our country : development and loss at the same time .
[buabua] This has been the difference between the development of our country and the development of Japan and South Korea : a huge wealth funnel exists in the development of our country , but such funnel is very small in Japan and South Korea .
[buabua] Of course whether my opinion is correct or not will be proved by time , but I must point it out for the citizens of our country , because this is my responsibility .
[buabua] Only after overcoming these problems can China achieve quicker and better development .
[buabua] All in all , achievements are the main trend , but problems should be pointed out and solved .
[buabua] IV. The economic growth will not slow down in a short period .
[buabua] When the year 2006 is coming to the end , people always make various predictions for the next year .
[buabua] At the end of each year , I always have to deal with a large number of questionnaires provided by various news media and research institutions .
[buabua] Speaking about the speed of economy , I believe that China 's economy will not slow down in a short period .
[buabua] In 2007 , China 's economy will continue with the momentum of 2006 with an economic growth rate of no less than 9 % .
[buabua] For China , opportunities and challenges will coexist in 2007 .
[buabua] From the perspective of the world economy , the economy tends to be less active in some countries , providing an opportunity as well as a challenge to China .
[buabua] The world development is unbalanced today , just like in the 1930s , when the capitalist countries in Europe and America were in the Great Depression , it was the time for great economic development of the Soviet Union .
[buabua] China should grasp the opportunity and lose no time carrying out development .
[buabua] When energy prices are too high , causing some countries to slow down their economic growth , it might be the great time for the development of China .
[buabua] But in the new year , the trend of economic structure adjustment in our country will arrive inevitably .
[buabua] For China 's economy , the largest challenge is to adjust the " strategy of earning foreign exchange " which was established at the beginning of reform and opening - up more than 20 years ago , correct the inordinate development mode of mercantilism , and lay emphasis on domestic development .
[buabua] Currently , what needs adjustment most is the export - oriented economy structure .
[buabua] Such structure has brought prosperity to China but also has produced negative effects on China 's economy .
[buabua] At present , the foreign exchange reserve of our country has reached over one trillion US dollars .
Such development mode is the typical mode of development based on foreign loans .
If such development strategy is adopted for a long term , a huge international risk will exist in the foreign exchange reserve ; on the other hand , the living standard of Chinese people can hardly be improved .
[buabua] Therefore , putting forth great efforts to correct the development mode of our country after 2007 has become an important issue for the future .
[buabua] The year 2007 should be a key year for China 's economic development .
[buabua] The high economic growth starting from 2003 is entering into the year 2007 , which will be a harvesting year for appraisal of achievements .
[buabua] In this year , a lot of projects that were initiated some years ago will be completed and put into operation , and many other projects are winding up .
So the year 2007 will be a connecting link between the preceding and the following years .
[buabua] China must ensure the stable economic development in 2007 in order to harvest the fruit of economic development .
[buabua] 2007 is also the year in which China 's economy will enter into a new stage .
[buabua] In the new year , new great goals will be implemented .
[buabua] Plans such as the long - expected 3G Plan may all be initiated in 2007 .
[buabua] Therefore , 2007 is a year for assurance .
Whether from the macroscopic and long - term perspective or from the short - term perspective of the 2008 Olympic Games , 2007 should be a year for assurance .
[buabua] At this moment , the Chinese government and enterprises should keep calm to deal with various changes appearing in international markets and grasp all kinds of favorable opportunities promptly and with no lessened efforts .
[buabua] The Chinese government and enterprises must realize that the campaign to turn around China 's economy has just started , and commanders at all levels must spare no effort in winning each local battle .
[buabua] Only with dedication and perseverance can we catch up with the advancing world .
Guo Kai 's Economics Notes : Six Cachets !
Guo Kai 's Economics Notes
I took the subway to meet someone at the railway station today and found a red header document posted everywhere inside the subway station .
A closer look told me it was the notice about public transportation price adjustment in Beijing .
I did n't care about the details because the news had been heard for a while .
What attracted me was the six red cachets below the notice , respectively Development and Reform Commission , Education Commission , Social Security Bureau , Financial Bureau , Traffic Commission and Transportation Administrative Bureau .
I know roughly the reason why the cachets of the former four organizations are required .
Development and Reform Commission is the organization in charge of prices .
Education Commission and Social Security Bureau correspond to the population on whom this policy may have relatively greater impact on .
Financial Bureau is the organization providing the fund .
I do n't know what kind of organizations Traffic Commission and Transportation Administrative Bureau are .
I even do n't know why these two organizations are not a single organization - Judging from the name , it seems that Transportation Administrative Bureau could be a division of Traffic Commission definitely .
However , now that the subway does have something to do with traffic and transportation , there is nothing strange with the appearance of the cachets of these two departments .
Then , what surprised me ?
When I saw these six cachets , my first reaction is that it is absolutely hopeless to rely on the government itself to control institutional thickening .
There must be a reason for a bloated government .
Look , I found out the reason for these six cachets with the slightest effort .
However , I am totally an outlier .
It is much easier for these governmental departments to find an excuse for their existence , is n't it ?
And their excuses are always affirmative , and always for the interests of the common people .
The existence of governmental departments is different from the existence of private institutions .
Private institutions spend their own money , and too much expansion will make them suffer loss .
What governmental departments spend is taxpayers ' money .
Regardless how much is spent , as long as the amount is not ridiculously large , they will never face the risk of loss and closing down
They themselves can find excuses for thickening without worrying about the problem of money .
What kind of excuses governmental institutions have will prevent thickening ?
I can hardly figure it out .
Of course , I do n't have any objections against this downward adjustment of public transportation prices , but those six cachets are really too striking .
Does Zhang Weiying 's misinterpretation of revolution harbor malicious intent ?
613305
-LSB- ＊Lingtai Shanyin＊ -RSB- .
In an interview with Professor Zhang Weiying that I read recently , when I read Professor Zhang 's understanding of revolution , I felt deeply worried - deeply worried for Beijing University , deeply worried for some outstanding contemporary youth , and deeply worried for the future of the country .
Some people oppose the whole class struggle thing , some people deny Mao Zedong Thought , but today , with democracy making progress , some people have the nerve to talk about revolution !!!
So as not to take his words out of context , I will insofar as possible cite Professor Zhang 's explanation of revolution :
" In reality , ' the way ' - or we can call it ' reason ' - has quite a complex relationship with the law .
What we call ' reason ' involves looking at what you do to see whether it creates value for society .
' Reason ' is above ' law ' : reasonable things have a natural validity ; lawmaking should be carried out according to the demands of reason ; unreasonable laws are not correct .
But in China , both in the past and now , there are many reversals of the natural order between law and reason ; thus making it hard to judge if a so - called " illegal " thing is also unreasonable .
For example , when there was a revolution in the past , it was precisely the most idealistic people who were willing to sacrifice their lives .
Why sacrifice their lives ?
Because it was illegal .
Or take bribery for example .
When someone is being blackmailed , he hands over the money , and that is a form of bribery .
But you ca n't say that his doing that is wrong : at least he deserves our empathy . "
1. In human history , there is a clear standard for good and evil , righteousness and iniquity , advances and reversals , glory and shame , progress and reaction , etc .
This standard is :
Things that are for the majority , for the masses of people , for altruism are good , righteous , progressive , glorious , advanced .
Things that are for the minority , against the people and self - serving are bad , unrighteous , shameful , reactionary .
Revolution is clearly a thing for the majority , for the masses of people , and altruistic ; therefore revolution is good , righteous , progressive , glorious and advanced !
2. Law has a clear class character ; bourgeois reason makes no sense for proletarian law .
And proletarian reason makes no sense for bourgeois law !
On major issues of principle , lawmaking starts with the protection of the interests of a particular class ; it is not that ' reason ' tops ' law ' : rational things have a natural validity ; so the making of laws should be carried out according to the requirements of reason , and irrational laws are wrong . "
This kind of so - called " reason " ignores the class nature of law , and in terms of the great theoretician Professor Zhang 's , this is a classic example of malicious intent .
What is Professor Zhang 's purpose in his misinterpretation of revolution and his ignoring the class nature of law ?
1. He misinterprets revolution in order to confuse good and evil , righteousness and iniquity , advances and reversals , glory and shame , progress and reaction , and to advance some unnamable theories .
2. He ignores the class nature of law in order to enact laws that harm the interests of the masses of workers and peasants .
Unfortunately , Professor Zhang may have greatly miscalculated .

Select and buy according to the following : .
Internal support characteristics .
Multidirectional movement during aerobic exercise requires extremely solid shoes .
Each manufacturer provides different internal support characteristics .
Some manufacturers use a molded midsole , so that the foot can land just right inside the shoe ; fibers going all around the shoes can also provide support .
In order to increase shoe flexibility , some manufacturers add a fiberboard padding only at the heel .
External support .
A firm , resistant heel support can greatly reduce heel displacement .
The wider part of the outsole is called the heel fixed strip .
It is made of plastic and spreads all the way around the foot , attached to the heel support .
Many shoes now use a fixed frame ; the fixed frame is a polymer part that is used as support and is distributed longitudinally around the outside of the shoe .
Other stability characteristics include a plastic support strip -LRB- generally connected to the eyelets -RRB- , Velcro hook , middle uppers can also provide side support characteristics .
Shock absorption .
Repeated impacts during aerobic exercise produces unique pressures that generally correspond to five times your body weight .
Therefore good shock - absorbing performance is essential .
The midsole helps to disperse these impacts .
A good midsole is made from extruded EVA or polyurethane .
The various manufacturers have come up with various technologies to further increase the midsole 's shock absorption .
If you are someone with insufficient downward tilting , or engage in intense exercise , you may require greater shock absorption than people with excess downward tilting .
Replaceable insoles .
The insole also has a certain shock - absorbing function , but at the same time it is the easiest to ruin .
As for replacing the insole when the shoe is halfway through its life , there is a basic principle involved ; after 150 hours of aerobic exercise , the insole may lose its bounce , and this is when it should be replaced .
-LRB- This varies according to the person and the type of training . -RRB-
Elasticity .
A shoe 's elasticity is determined by how you feel when your feet move .
Shoes with just a fiberboard pad at the heel have better flexibility than athletic shoes using a complete fiberboard design .
Athletic shoes with low uppers can also improve flexibility .
Fit .
Your feet may swell when they are under pressure and engaging in aerobic exercise .
The heat produced by intense exercise may cause the feet to swell by half a size .
At the same time , when you buy shoes they should not be too tight ; there should be a space as wide as a thumbnail between the tip of the shoe and your longest toe to ensure that your toes can move freely , and it should fit properly at the heel .
In addition , you should regularly measure the length of your feet , because increasing age and injuries can change the size of your feet .

After 150 hours of aerobic exercise , insoles may lose their elasticity , that is when they should be replaced .
This is too dogmatic !

I reckon this refers to domestically produced shoes .
But after you add an insole , the impact on the knee joints is much less .
The kind of heel insoles on the Wal - Mart pharmacy shelves are OK .

In terms of whitening , I prefer the essence in the NeoTime gift set .
The bottle of essence itself is merely a kind of moisturizing lotion , but it comes with a complimentary bottle of L - Ascorbic acid dry powder .
My way is to take a small bottle of 25 ml to pour the essence in , add a little L - Ascorbic acid dry powder , and shake well .
The homemade whitening lotion like this will be consumed in about a week , and the same method is used to make more .
I have read relevant information that L - Ascorbic acid oxidizes easily after it dissolves in the water .
It will lose the whitening effect once oxidized .
So , make - and - consume can ensure what I use are the unoxidized whitening contents , which are pretty effective .
What 's more , this is a very cheap way of use .
NeoTime sells for over 300 a set , including day cream , night cream and essence , of which a bottle of essence lasts for two to three months if used my way .
It is a bit more affordable than the Vitamin C whitening products that cost several hundred .
Actually , I have used SKII products .
If I 'm not financially constrained , I like to use SKII goddess fluid .
The skin was in a good state after use .
However , I heard recently that some contents in SKII do harm to the skin over time , and so I dare not use any more after a second thought .
Anyway , my skin now is very good without using it .
I do n't like wearing makeup , facing the sky everyday with bare skin .
This is because my former boyfriend said he liked me because I did n't wear makeup .
Upon hearing this , I suddenly realized it turned out no men liked their girlfriend wearing makeup .
Therefore , I practically do n't buy any makeups and never use blush or eyeshadow , apart from buying some lightening makeup base for use as sun screen .
I do n't know if everyone agrees with this .
Anyway , I feel very easy on the face without makeup , no need to be careful everywhere .
I feel uncomfortable with lip color , which makes me careful even if I 'm just drinking water .

[] Also Speaking a Word for the Main Theme of the State Administration of Radio Film and Television .
[wmkj2006] Recently , at the annual meeting of the Capital TV Program Production Association , a person in charge from the State Administration of Radio Film and Television put forward requirements for this year 's TV drama market : " The quantity of TV dramas produced should be controlled , with the slogan of the year of quality for TV dramas being proposed .
There will be certain requirements on prime time programs on satellite channels across the country , which is programs at various places should primarily revolve around the main theme . "
[wmkj2006] Once the news is released , it aroused a debate on the Internet .
[wmkj2006] The focuses of the debate are : the requirement of the State Administration of Radio Film and Television that various places should broadcast TV dramas revolving around the main theme is a restriction on the freedom of radio and television , as well as interference with public entertainment orientation using the administrative power ; what on earth are the subjects that belong to the main theme , and what the main theme should represent .
[wmkj2006] Currently , the programs of many TV channels are increasingly vulgar , and there are poor taste entertainment programs , such as variety shows and competition shows , that come one after another like following the trend ; [wmkj2006] the screen is saturated with pornography , violence and murders in TV dramas ; Kong Fu dramas are recast one after another , [wmkj2006] dramas about feudal royal families and anecdotes are absurd and far - fetched , [wmkj2006] and Hong Kong and Taiwanese romantic dramas are characterized by weeping and arguing .
[wmkj2006] Can the voluminous broadcast of such TV dramas on TV channels bring pleasant visual enjoyment and spiritual nurture to viewers ?
[wmkj2006] The result could only be huge waste of human and financial resources , as well as destruction of environmental resources .
[wmkj2006] Looking back on some excellent TV dramas shown in recent years , for example : military TV dramas including Long March , the Eight Route Army and Drawing Sword , and modern - theme TV dramas that reflect rural reform , kinship and friendship including Hometown , My Family Tree and Mother , are much popular among viewers .
[wmkj2006] Now , at the mentioning of the main theme , people tend to equalize only those about revolutions and history to the main theme .
As a matter of fact , the main theme is reflected in different aspects of society .
[wmkj2006] For example : those that reflect the socialist ideological and ethical progress and the democratic and legal progress ; those that encourage and motivate people to work hard and innovate for the national prosperity , people 's happiness and social advancement ; those that help people to tell right from wrong , insisting on anything true , kind and beautiful and resisting anything fake , evil and ugly ; and those that depict national unification , ethnic solidarity , pleasant people , and stable society and politics etc. are what the main theme represents .
[wmkj2006] It does not follow that the main theme would be eulogizing a specific political party or group .
It is fundamentally decided by people 's value orientation , where main theme is what people welcome and people like .
[wmkj2006] I believe the regulation released by the State Administration of Radio Film and Television is appropriate and at the right time , in that it will help to prevent the degradation of the current TV programs , advocate good social atmosphere and right values among people , and establish a correct direction of public opinion .

[seahome] Very good comments .
[seahome] Look at those so - called blockbuster movies these years , such as The Promise , Curse of ... and The Banquet , plus the TV dramas like a pile of rubbish .
[seahome] Look at the response among people of the two - million yuan Crazy Stone , as well as the Silent Witness that boasts no famous director or cast .
The art should originally come from the reality .
[seahome] I support the view of the State Administration of Radio Film and Television .
Let those big - shot directors rest aside and my strong support for those TV dramas close to reality and life , good ones like the Silent Witness and Vertical Strike .

[] How Come My Hubby has n't been Able to Find a Job in My Place , What can I Do ?
[] <POSTER> Dreamer
[Dreamer] My hubby and I live in two places .
I am -- the company I work for now is applying green cards for both of us .
He works in a very stingy company , so , [Dreamer] I hope my hubby can find a job in the city where I am .
My hubby is somewhat like a kid , thoughtless , and fond of playing , [Dreamer] and does not like to study .
He has been looking for a job for more than half a year .
He got one onsite and five phone interviews but he blew up every one of them .
[Dreamer] Hubby also said he was trying hard , but more than half a year has gone by , and there are still grammatical errors in his cover letter , several [Dreamer] times , the emails he forwarded to me also contained grammatical errors and were not relevant to the topics , etc .
I told him that while looking for jobs , many people [Dreamer] were putting forth a lot of efforts , but he never searched data on the Internet or found out how other people were looking for jobs .
Once [Dreamer] I went to see him and he happened to be on a phone interview .
He did not even find out in advance what that company does .
[Dreamer] When he was asked whether he had any questions , he asked them , what does your company do ?
They had to explain it to him .
[Dreamer] He asked them : Does n't it sound like it 's illegal !
[Dreamer] I asked hubby whether he wants to change his job at all to be with me .
Hubby says , yes , ah , and I 've been working hard on it .
In addition , [Dreamer] he likes kids very much and really hopes that I can get pregnant in the second half of this year .
I said if you want me to be pregnant , you 've got to be here with me .
[Dreamer] He says , I am working on it , ah .
[Dreamer] I do n't know what to say .
To force him , I think he is also quite pitiable .
Not to force him , I think the mistakes he made [Dreamer] were all too simple , purely because of his carelessness ; besides , he is n't a top expert technology - wise .
I really do n't know when [Dreamer] we can be together .
Both sides are lonely ; both paying the rent and large cell phone bills .
I could n't think of any life more depressing than this !

Freezing the moments
Seeing the Year of the Dog going by one day after another and the Spring Festival approaching , we are busy greeting the advent of the " golden pig " and busy gathering with colleagues , friends and schoolmates .
We two have had no time virtually to have a quiet dinner at home ever since last week .
It was often deep night when we were back home !
Tutu went to a regular monthly gathering at the club again today .
I learned from his call that many people were there this time and even some of Hali 's friends went .
Brother Jia will go back to Germany on Friday .
They say we should be really high , and it seems god knows when we will be back home !
I can not be idle either and directly went to the department store to enjoy myself !
LYSH will be off on his/her home leave from tomorrow and wo n't be back until after the Spring Festival .
He/She can rest for more than a month altogether .
How envious I am !
I would laugh to death if I could have such long vacation each year !

The little one has always remembered what I once said about a TV program , which documented people going to Tibet .

Thoughts on Ethnic Conflict and the Policy of Consideration for Minorities

Topic : Thoughts on Ethnic Conflict and the Policy of Consideration for Minorities
Posting station : BBS Unnamed space station -LRB- Mon Jan 29 14:57:49 2007 -RRB- , at the station .
This article was originally written in response to a Muslim Club question ; if its tone is excessive in spots , please excuse .
What you said is right : many of these are individual clashes .
It is very difficult for one person 's ethnic or religious status to shape a person 's behavior .
If one individual in an ethnic group or religion does something bad , you can only say that that person 's character has an essentially evil side to it .
If he does good , then certainly a large part of his character is good .
If we reverse this logic , no religion or ethnic group in the world is without blame .
The Han have a longer history than the Hui and a greater population ; who knows how many clashes there have been historically with the peripheral minorities ?
So can we say that the Han are such and such ?
With regard to certain clashes involving local ethnic groups or territories , it does n't say anything about whether that ethnic group is bad or good ; rather it 's a tragedy brought on by a sort of " security crisis " and " misinterpreted information . "
Most of all , it 's basically a matter of the political system and of trust .
Regardless of whether it 's the Han or the Hui , when friction first crops up , their lack of faith in the government and law -LRB- this is a characteristic of many autarchies -RRB- makes people believe that the government can not fairly and effectively handle the situation .
This gives both sides the illusion they 're in a state of anarchy .
More often than not they resort to using the strength of their own villages or ethnic group to protect their security .
This " civic conflict " gets turned into an " ethnic conflict . "
And when one side mobilizes its own village to respond to the security threat -LRB- not just physical safety but also moral safety - protecting their own way of life -RRB- that they see as coming from another village , the other side obviously will not stand idly by but will also mobilize and prepare .
In this way the impressions of the first group will be validated , and so on , with both sides falling into the vicious cycle of " security crisis " just as when a war breaks out in international politics ; the clash is unavoidable .
Add to this the fact that both sides include some people who , because they have been regularly bullied , or the village headman or sheikh wants to use this as an opportunity to gain some political advantage and increase his own influence , seizing the chance to fan the flames and inciting people to fight .
Some governments -LRB- the Manchu Qing -RRB- even adopted a policy of " using the barbarians to control the barbarians , " stirring up conflict , using the Hui to control the Han and the Han to control the Hui .
There are some people who make an uproar over Hui - Han clashes who take a one - sided view ; they see only the clash , but they overlook how many times these types of clashes have been settled , how many times there has been cooperation between the two groups .
Some people claim to be involved in academic research , then the first thing that should be done is to list all the interactions between the two groups in history and in the present : clashes , peaceful coexistence , cooperation .
In this way you get at least three variables , and only then can you analyze the causal relationship .
Some people 's resulting variables do not change , or there is only one value : clashes .
What kind of " scientific research " result can people like this achieve ?
Changes in variables should also be considered in terms of consideration .
You look at the many policies of minority consideration , but you should also look at how , in a majority - Han society , in a society that stresses uniformity and looks down on individuality , there are just as many mechanisms and opportunities for discrimination against minorities , if not more .
Did you know that in interviews some people are rejected just because they have a northwest accent ?
Do you know how distressed Muslims are in a unit or company where there is no halal canteen ?
Have you ever heard a Mongol father cry because his son has to start studying Chinese in first grade ?
Do you understand how development of the West has plundered so many resources and left the local minorities just as needy as they ever were ?
This lack of consideration is most often not obvious , but it is everywhere .
Of course these forms of discrimination very seldom come from the whole " Han race " as an abstract ; most often they come from the system - a form of ethnic rule that combines centralized authority + representatives of local minorities .
It can not be denied ; minorities have many faults as well .
However , the vast majority of the people at the lower levels of society are blameless , just as the vast majority of our Han compatriots at the lower levels of society are blameless .
Those who should be blamed are the cadres in the upper echelons of the Party , the so - called ethnic cadres and the influential capitalists in league with them .
In the past when the local tyrants and despots among the minorities were overthrown , the masses of minorities and the Han were equally happy .
But today they find that the cadres and capitalists from those years are now standing together , and the Han people of the same class from those years are beginning to suppress them .
Of course some people say that the Communist Party and most Han cadres have made many contributions to the construction of border and minority areas , and have sacrificed so much .
Right , the minorities should be grateful and remember the contributions of the Han cadres , and this proves that any two ethnic groups can live peacefully together .
However , it can also be said that the Party and the country have a duty to provide basic infrastructure and improve economic development ,
because since you govern this land , and you collect taxes , do you really want to wipe your ass and leave ?
More importantly , the so - called " preferential policy " can only be given by a powerful ethnic group or force .
This should be common knowledge - the people who can give are always higher - ups .
And the weaker ethnic groups can only accept it passively .
But let 's not mention on what basis the Communist Party divided 55 ethnic groups into " minorities " !!??
The essence of our Party 's ethnic preferential policies is to permanently institute this strong - weak relationship between the Han race and its fraternal ethnic groups -LRB- the relationship between the center and the fringe , the governing and the governed .
Let the Han race -LRB- mainly meaning the inner bureaucracy -RRB- act like the emperor , doling out to the " minority " here and there .
And the " minorities " can only feel deeply grateful , how will they dare discuss equality !!
People who are given consideration are in mainstream eyes the weak ; as time goes by , the " minorities " who are given consideration also get accustomed to this arrangement and believe that they are the weak ones and should be dominated , as if they were inferior !!!!
Do n't you see it ,
but whenever there is some event like National Day or May First , all the ethnic groups get together in Tiananmen Square , and people dress as " minorities , " wear their costumes , their traditional folk dress , even if they have never worn such outfits in their daily lives .
While the Han leaders and representatives are wearing Western suits and leather shoes .
What does this explain ?
It perfectly reflects this strong - weak relationship : the Han are contemporary , and the minorities are backward , stuck in the past and abnormal !!!!
This is the price to pay for being considered !!!
What need is even there to talk of abuse !!??
All ethnic groups have been enslaved .
What else is there ?
The result of receiving consideration is the degeneration of these ethnic groups , with no hope of progress .
Do n't we really know where those people got their sour grapes ?

From the conditions we see at present , the intensity at the epicenter possibly exceeded reinforcement standards .
But the building grade for such types of public buildings as schools and hospitals ought to be above a grade B , and absolutely not below grade C .
If construction had been strictly carried out according to reinforcement specifications , such serious widespread collapsing should not have occurred .
In fact , right next to the collapsed school buildings were buildings that did not collapse .
Therefore , emergency assessment needs to be carried out on these collapsed school buildings , hospitals and other public buildings ; design plans , components , concrete , steel reinforcements , bricks etc should be sampled and notarized , in preparation for inspection and appraisal .
If it is found that some aspects of design did not comply with mandatory national standards , or that shoddy materials were used , inferior quality , or any of these circumstances , then the legal responsibilities of the authorities and people involved should be looked into .
Only this way can we lay to rest the ghosts of the students killed in the disaster , can we account to the parents of the victims , can we obtain justice for the community , can we warn later generations of the lessons to be learned .

Victims and the public can also help , remembering that samples must undergo notarization by a notary office before they can have legal validity .
" Amid tears , conscience has come back ;
on ruins , humanity has stood firm .
The great earthquake has shaken off the dusts on our mind , and has shattered our everyday masks . "
People 's spirits exuded in the disaster relief effort are apparently the comeback of selfless collectivism , rather than what is called the " comeback of conscience " or the " awakening and growth of civil consciousness . "
What stand firm are the solidarity of people under the Party 's leadership , as well as collectivism and patriotism , and what has fallen is instead " selfish humanity . "
It 's not even the empty " humanity of love . "
How can it be explained with the " humanity of love " that many ordinary heroes have given up their love for families and carried forward the proletarian spirits of selflessness , interdependent friendship and total devotion .
It can be seen from " humanity has stood firm , " which is eulogized in the article , that it advocates unrestrained humanity , as well as slandering all nobility as " everyday masks " and " dusts on our mind . "
However , does n't the disaster relief effort mark the reawakening of the noble spirits rather than fully unrestrained humanity ?
I think that if our Earthquake Administration had been able beforehand to do a simulation of big earthquakes on this Longmenshan mountain earthquake belt , then on that day of May 12 , once the Earthquake Administration had measured the quake at a magnitude of 7.8 , we would have been able to broadly judge the extent of damage and destruction in the earthquake disaster zone .
If the simulation program was well designed , circumstances like debris blocking roads , heavy rainfall obstructing parachute drops , power and communication outages should all have been within expectations .
Instead in this instance the Liberation Army headquarters emergency contingency plan obviously was not a contingency plan designed with earthquakes as the assumed condition , as the soldiers all rushed straight to Wenchuan , without immediately sending out troops in the direction of badly - hit areas Beichuan , Qingchuan and Gansu's Longnan ; only 24 hours later was the full extent of the disaster area taken into consideration .
In addition , the breakdown in communication also brought a serious problem to the surface .
In the past , Red Army regiments were able to maintain contact with central headquarters by relying on just one battered radio .
On this occasion though , people had no way to deal with the communication failure .
It is clear that preparations prior to the event were not constructed on the basis of an earthquake disaster simulation .
Whether it is meant as an insult or compliment , I must say that this nickname " blue ants " is quite striking .
Millions upon millions of little blue ants uniting together is a huge unstoppable force .
Millions upon millions of little blue ants , each one industrious and pragmatic , diligent and dedicated , so self - confident , unhurried , relaxed and hard working .
In those days , no matter which position we worked in , everybody was one cog in the wheel .
Our motherland laid down the basically complete working foundation of the People 's Republic with the labor of these very millions upon millions of blue ants , constructing a powerful national defense to protect the peace and tranquility of the homeland , pioneering the working people 's very own revolutionary theatre .

There is only one word 's difference between " website operations " and " network operations , " so it is very easy to get them mixed up .
Website operations refers to operational and management work relating to product management , content management , updating the content and market promotion and so on of a website on the Internet .
In broad terms , this includes several components , such as website planning , product development , network marketing and customer services .
In narrow terms , it refers particularly to operational and management work after a website has been set up , such as content planning , planning market activities and customer services .
As a matter of fact , the term " network operations " is rarely used and can not mean the same as " website operations . "
A network is a very broad concept and refers in a general sense to various types of networks formed by computer network hardware .
More often than not , network operations refers to the operation of these networks , like construction of and connection to part of the Internet network operated and managed by China Telecom .
And in " network marketing , " this network refers particularly to the Internet , meaning activities such as market activities and marketing and promotion carried out over the Internet .
Based on if the approach is moral , methods of search engine optimization have been divided into two groups , black hat SEO and white hat SEO .
Both methods can help you -LRB- improve search engine ranking -RRB- , and one of them enables you to improve your ranking quickly .
However , this more aggressive method may make your website punished by some search engines , which will refuse to include it and issue a warning to you .
These search engine companies have also said publicly on their official sites that using black hat SEO will only bring you trouble .
What is white hat SEO technology ?
White hat SEO means that one does not attempt to cheat search engines and follow the rules they set when doing SEO .
Additionally , web pages optimized using such methods are beneficial to Internet surfing and manifest the win - win result of search engines and network administrators in a good way .
What is black hat SEO technology ?
Since black hat SEO involves cheating , such a way to improve ranking is not endorsed by search engines .
These methods include over - redirecting to pages and hidden texts etc .
Even if search engines have made it clear that they would punish websites that use black hat SEO , the latter would still not cease their acts .
Why ?
For such a great historic event as the Beijing Olympics , Mr. Wu of course must go to Beijing to personally experience the exciting scene .
After painstaking efforts , he reached an agreement with his boss at the company to take a two - month vacation .
In accordance with the instructions regarding the visa application listed on the website of the Chinese consulate , Mr. Wu prepared the required documents , photos , etc .
He also noticed that it was especially suggested on the consulate website that visa should be secured first before purchasing an airline ticket .
He thought the comrades at the consulate were very considerate and thoughtful for their compatriots .
On the day he went to the consulate in New York , he told a lie , saying he was sick and =asked for sick leave for a day .
There were lots of people at the consulate , and he waited in line for four whole hours .
Seeing that so many people were applying to go to China , he was very much moved .
The motherland was indeed full of glamour , and he felt extremely proud .
By the time he reached the window , his stuff was immediately thrown back : Materials not sufficient !
He must additionally submit a return airline ticket and a letter of invitation from his relative or friend in China .
" But it is said on the website of your consulate that visa application should be made first before purchasing an airline ticket . "
The answer was : " There are new regulations now , and new regulations shall prevail . "
Somewhat astounded , Mr. Wu tried hard to blame himself , " How come I had n't thought about these in advance . "
Various news sources including people.com.cn all reported that our neighbor , Nepal , is currently holding an election .
So , the election already seems to be somewhat taking a direction , with the Communist Party of Nepal -LRB- Maoist -RRB- currently in the lead .
I read a piece of news that said one of the leaders of the Communist Party of Nepal -LRB- Maoist -RRB- , Mr. Baburam , got far more votes than the others did .
I saw from this piece of news that there are mainly three powerful parties in this election in Nepal .
One is the Communist Party of Nepal -LRB- Maoist -RRB- which we just mentioned above is currently taking the lead in the election , one is the Nepali Congress Party , and still another is the Communist Party of Nepal -LRB- United Marxist - Leninist -RRB- .
At first , I did n't understand why these two Communist organizations in Nepal did n't unite to take part in the election together .
If they 're each after their own goals , would n't their strength be split up ?
Only when I read an explanation from Mr. Baburam later did I realize the reason why they did n't unite to take part in the election together .
Evidence shows that once an employee becomes the boss , he / she will never show mercy to workers , with even wiser tricks to discipline staff than those who have always been a boss .
Having come from the camp , he knows well how to hit the tender spots of employees .
Employees who work for such a boss can never find a loophole .
Such a kind of bosses are even more fierce than those who are " hereditary " .
It is said that Zhang Yin , a native of Heilongjiang and born in Guangdong in 1957 , had poor and miserable childhood due to her father 's persecution and the large number of siblings in her family .
At the age of 27 , Zhang Yin gave up her hard - earned salary and housing and took with her RMB 30,000 to make a living in Hong Kong , starting a scrap paper - for - cash business .
She went to the United States and established a company in 1990 , and became the queen of scrap paper recycling 10 years later .
She invested in a new factory in 1996 in Dongguan , Guangdong , which specializes in producing high - grade wrapping paper .
Her secret to success is an industrial chain constructed with " two lows , " which involve buying scrap paper at a low price in the United States and then producing highly sought - after high - grade paper products by taking advantage of the cheap land , energy and labor in the mainland .
May 12 , 2008 , the Chinese history will always remember this day .
China experienced a great earthquake rarely seen in history , which aroused the concern of the Chinese nation including people of Chinese origins across the globe .
Several hours after the earthquake , the respected premier , an old man 66 years of age who was a thousand miles away , risked his life to appear at the front line in Sichuan 's worst - hit disaster area .
Several dozen thousand PLA and Armed Police troops marched a thousand miles and appeared as soon as they could on the scene of disaster - hit areas .
China Central Television , China National Radio and others cut short their normal broadcasting schedules and committed themselves to live broadcast throughout the disaster - rescue effort .
One hoarse voice after another spread across the Chinese land through these media , over which so many hot - blooded young people shed their tears .
My blood surged when I , who seldom watch TV , saw the premier made the promise in a choking and hoarse voice to the orphans who lost their families , " the government will not leave you alone and will take care of you as if you were home . "
I believe every Chinese son or daughter who sees the scene will be moved .
At 14:28 on May 12 , 2008 , there was a massive earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 in the Wenchuan area of Sichuan province .
From that point on , an impressive earthquake relief effort with the active participation of the whole party , the whole army and the whole nation and people began on the Chinese mainland !
It was not spontaneous ; it was an organized , orderly , and large - scale mass earthquake relief effort under the leadership of party organizations and governments at all levels .
In the immense ranks of the earthquake relief effort , Communist Party cadres and government officials of all levels assumed the directing and organizing positions , and our people 's army charged in the forefront .
The emergency relief and rescue brigades sent from all parts of the country , the medical corps , the anti-epidemic corps , the goods transportation contingent and also the volunteers followed closely behind , heading for the disaster zone .
Airplanes roared ; vehicle wheels rumbled ; and there were also the formidable ranks on foot , charging full steam ahead like the roll of an ocean wave , as the heroic and stirring act unfolded on the Chinese mainland !
The earthquake was a lesson , a mirror , and a great practical test of truth !
People have also criticized Walmart online for displaying favoritism , contributing just 3 million RMB -LRB- equivalent to 430,700 U.S. dollars -RRB- to the earthquake relief , while donating 2 million U.S. dollars for Hurricane Katrina .
A spokesman for the company said that cash donation was just one part of a larger scale disaster relief effort of the company , and that Walmart had also made use of its professional experience in supply and logistics to provide assistance for disaster relief .
The spokesman pointed out that Walmart 's work in combating disasters should not be evaluated solely on the basis of the amount of cash .
China 's Minister of Commerce Chen Deming on Thursday expressed gratitude for the support provided for earthquake relief by foreign - owned enterprises .
At a press conference , he said that foreign - owned enterprises had contributed a total of 1.95 billion RMB in donations .
State - owned media Xinhua News Agency , citing information provided by the State Council Information Office -LRB- the State Council Information Office -RRB- , reported that as of Thursday , domestic and international donations had reached 21.4 billion RMB -LRB- approximately 3 billion U.S. dollars -RRB- .
Humans can manufacture tanks that are much more powerful than ants , but humans can not manufacture a living ant ...
However advanced instruments manufactured by humans are , their level of complexity can not compare with a section of a toad 's nerve .
Do not regard earthquake prediction as a " practical skill " ; rather regard it as academic work in a study .
Take no notice of the real results in terms of preventing earthquakes or minimizing disasters ; rather singlemindedly pursue the scientific research level embodied in " prediction success rates . "
In the course of major disaster warnings , too many disputes relating to powers and interests are entangled .
The directions of research into earthquake prevention and disaster minimization are just confined to research into the phenomenon of earthquakes , but efforts to intervene in urban construction , to formulate and supervise building standards , and perfect and improve disaster rescue mechanisms and other aspects have been neglected .... .
We have also become blindly abreast of foreign countries even in earthquake research : we do n't believe in living beings raised as part of nature ; we just believe in the instruments we ourselves manufacture .
We do n't believe the warnings sent out by nature ; we just believe the warnings emitted by instruments in laboratories .
We do n't believe in what is seen and heard with their own eyes by millions of ordinary people ; we just believe in the authoritative conclusions of experts and scholars .
Chinese seismology is galloping down the wrong road .
No matter whether the school buildings are dangerous or are beautiful " jerry - built buildings , " as far as this writer knows , China 's laws and regulations concerning construction contracts are very complete .
Why are there so many " jerry - built projects ? "
Because the " owners " are the government and the competent education departments .
When people in possession of huge power indulge in their own desires , it will breed corruption , which leads to sale and purchase of official posts as well as all kinds of " jerry - built projects . "
Those contractors who like to take advantage of loopholes in the government 's monitoring and regulations , they know that the cost of =bribing several government officials is far less than that of reducing construction expenses .
Therefore , in the past few years , the corruption in the education sector that common people have strongly lashed out against includes precisely the lack of openness and transparency concerning school building construction , which has led to the non-existence of rules and regulations for project management and the sloppy enforcement of quality inspection , leaving behind large numbers of hazards for potential accidents .
This earthquake was just a comprehensive explosion ; that 's all .
Facing the " jerry - built projects , " some leaders in the government and educational departments could =deny by all means what they did and could put the blame on this sudden natural disaster , but how could they also get rid of their own conscience , and how could they face those parents who lost their children !
People in disaster - hit areas are suffering pains and hardships .
If people continue to be passionate , hilarious , joyful and relaying as usual , then , all these will inevitably become aloofness , numbness and ridiculousness .
If the torch relay is not terminated , it is like a family having a funeral on the one hand and a wedding on the other , which is unacceptable , unreasonable and absurd .
Instead , terminating the torch relay will reflect a kind of affection for compatriots and humane care , as well as a kind of attention , compassion and support of the whole nation towards those in the disaster - hit areas .
Terminating the torch relay , I believe , will be able to win compassion , understanding and support of the international community , as well as understanding , endorsement and support of the whole nation .
Terminating the torch relay will only present an image to the international community that the Chinese people face up to realities , seek truth and pragmatism , fear no difficulties , share one purpose , and unite to fight against the disaster .
On the contrary , if we simply continue the relay , the international community will only turn a cold shoulder to and look down upon China .
Cancel the relay , save the money that was meant for the relay and send it to areas affected by the disaster , so as to help the people there .
Since the Tangshan Earthquake , the starting point for construction standards in the mainland is that under an earthquake of the same magnitude , buildings should preserve their basic frame without collapsing .
However , most of the buildings in this hard - hit area did not meet these requirements , with the widespread collapse of school buildings in particular arousing intense public disgust .
Raising standards to in excess of Tangshan 's 8.0 magnitude could leave authorities with some breathing space for explanation , and alleviate public anger .
According to information leaked from numerous channels , we can say for certain that before the earthquake struck , the serious earthquake risk in the Ngawa region was already well known to the CCP .
Although current forecasting standards can not give us an accurate prediction of the exact time , place , and strength of an earthquake , there is considerable experience accumulated both in China and overseas in predicting to within the timeframe of a month , and the area of a province .
In regions where the earthquake risk is high , warning the public and spreading disaster prevention awareness could greatly reduce casualties during earthquakes ; this is the very minimum duty that any responsible government should undertake .
In the past the CCP has done a lot of these sorts of things , but on this occasion not only did nothing , but in response to queries from the public pulled out some whopping lies , playing syntax games with words like " geological disaster " and " earthquake disaster " .
Let 's put aside prior donations Wang Shi has made .
While it was still time to save lives in the disaster relief , he Wang Shi had been to the Sichuan Construction Authority to meet with officials from the Ministry of Housing and Urban - Rural Development , among others .
What 's the purpose of his act ?
In fact , it is obvious enough that the Sichuan Provincial Construction Authority was certainly an important player in post-disaster rebuilding .
That is to say basically all future rebuilding will be done through the Construction Authority .
It 's a preemptive way to have meetings now in advance with the Construction Authority amid disaster relief .
That is 100 million yuan is first donated as its deposit for post-disaster rebuilding , such that Vanke 's income will not be 100 million yuan , but a substantial part of the 75 billion yuan the country will invest .
We can say Vanke has got very smart public measures , which proves " Vanke has been doing well in terms of the government relationship and brand image .
This is their specialty . "
Therefore , we see Vanke has tried to hook a big fish with a small profit -LRB- the donation is less than 0.04 % of their net profit -RRB- !!!
What on earth does Vanke do ?
I had no idea , until now that it is a parasite fed by mortgage slaves , and it turns out that =it would be such a miser !
A good conscience can be seen .
In the great earthquake in Wenchuan , when numerous " jerry - built " school buildings became the graves of buried students , five Hope Elementary Schools , built from donations by the " Han Long Group " ten years ago , are safe and sound .
The " Greatest Hope Elementary School " -- Liu Han Hope Elementary School alone saved the lives of 483 elementary school students and teachers .
The five schools together protected the lives and safety of thousands of students and teachers !
Obviously , the contribution of the Greatest Hope Elementary Schools is immeasurable .
Not only do the Greatest Hope Elementary Schools personify good conscience , but they also make the conscience fuller .
When some officials and earthquakes experts swore and solemnly stated that the schools could have easily collapsed before and gave a lot of reasons , the Hope Elementary Schools that did n't collapse exposed their shameful lies .
This is the other reason why the Hope Elementary Schools touched China .
Therefore , I suggest awarding a " People 's Good Conscience " reward to the boss of the " Han Long Group " company , Liu Han , who is the donor of the Greatest Hope Elementary Schools and regards project quality as his own life , and to General manager Sun Xiaodong , to thank them for their contribution of cherishing human life and safeguarding human conscience .
We should call on the whole society -LRB- especially the developers and officials at all levels who are already corrupt , becoming corrupt , are going to be corrupt but have n't yet started to be corrupt -RRB- to learn from them and spread the seeds of good conscience far and wide .
The elite are in the majority , and there is the mainstream media as well -- they do not mention or seldom mention the socialist spirit and thought .
An argument is also unavoidable .
There is one thing in common .
Let me say it once again : everyone focuses on the spiritual aspect , political aspect and ideological aspect ; follow what is happening and focus !
This point has particular significance in a period focused on the economy .
We should realize what factors influence the earthquake relief ; this point is extremely important !
The recognition of this point began with the fight against flood in '98 and the battle against SARS in '03 .
Today we should have a deeper and clearer awareness !
The reform and opening - up as well as the socialist market economy have also undoubtedly undergone a trial .
What was the result ?
The weaker is the level of marketization , the stronger is the ability to resist setbacks .
I do n't want to say much more .
In fact , there is no absolute need to test it for yourself .
It is enough to take a look at the hurricane in New Orleans in the United States and do a comparison !
How did the US , which claims to be the strongest and most advanced in the world , perform when confronted with the New Orleans hurricane ?
It has remained a subject for world ridicule even today .
But they themselves have believed that they did rather well .
Why ?
Because their market economy is so standardized , so ubiquitous , and everyone believes so deeply in the almighty power of money and the supremacy of individual rights !
In addition , they could not possibly mobilize people like us in this way , because they do not have this sort of spiritual strength that we have !
" Nonfood inflation is certain to go higher , and is already creeping up , " said Sun Mingchun , an economist for Lehman Brothers in Hong Kong .
He believes that if food prices go down , but nonfood inflation goes up , economically it 's a big problem .
According to statistics of the National Bureau of Statistics , China 's consumer - price index -LRB- CPI -RRB- excluding food prices increased by 1.8 % in March , while it hovered at 1 % or less for most of 2006 and 2007 .
The accelerated rise of the indicator likely shows that higher wages and raw - material costs are being reflected in a broader range of goods , a phenomenon that will impact the global market given China 's importance as a global supplier of many products .
Another factor that drives inflation up is : higher rents due to continued housing price rises in most cities .
J.P. Morgan economists expect nonfood inflation to continue to speed up to an average 2.5 % for all of 2008 .
These " patriots " ought to know , if you obtain the citizenship of a foreign country you are no longer a " Chinese " , but instead just an " overseas Chinese " .
You should love the country you belong to , do your duty towards it , make a contribution ; this is the minimum moral standard required of a person .
If you still have some feeling for your native land , please help it move from savagery to civilization , instead of holding a candle to the devil and pulling it into darkness ;
If you have got yourself a foreign country 's green card , you owe a favor to both your mother country and your country of residence .
You should put your heart and soul into promoting understanding , communication and friendship between the two countries .
If you guys wish China to have a favorable image , then you ought to work to clean away the grime and =abscesses on her body .
And if you would like to see Chinese people respected by the world , you guys first should learn how to be a civilized person .
Regrettably , the behavior of some of you is currently adding substance to the words of that CNN anchorman .
You guys ought to understand that maybe from your verbal violence , CNN 's reporters will no longer say this kind of thing , but there will be more people who will say it under their breath .
When building a simple building in the past , branches , ah , bamboo fences , ah , are used to build buildings , but there is a disadvantage to these kinds of buildings , that is , they easily catch fire .
I think now our country should research a kind of low - cost plastic that does n't catch fire , but is very inexpensive .
What would it be like to use this kind of cheap plastic to build buildings ?
Therefore , I propose that if an elementary school or a residential building is to be built in an earthquake - prone area in our country , it should depend on whether or not there is enough money to construct the building with extremely strong earthquake resistance ?
This point -- many buildings of ancient times in our country still remain today , and there are also some experiences of buildings abroad , plus all kinds of modern science and technology , buildings can be made extremely sturdy .
If there is indeed not enough money , then they should rather not build it and save the money .
Instead they should rather simply build simple buildings that can be constructed using cheap and fireproof plastic , letting students take classes in those simple buildings .
Even though it may be somewhat crude , it actually can ensure the safety of lives when earthquakes strike .
As time goes by , rescue forces are rapidly expanding ,
disaster - relief materials are continuously being transported to affected areas , all sorts of dangers are continuously being eliminated , and major infrastructures critical to the life safety of disaster victims are being quickly restored .
Different departments and organizations at various levels and locations have been closely knit around the Party 's Central Committee and the Sate Council , performing their respective duties with loyalty .
Charitable individuals and =volunteers from all around have given what they have , be it money , energy , wit or goods .
When hospitals are short of blood , people took to the streets to voluntarily donate blood , showing care for those hit by the disaster .
Such a touching picture of solidarity , friendship , mutual assistance and devotion is a wonderful picture we 've anticipated for a long time , is n't it ?
Victims , please do hold on .
The ocean of love brought together by people of our motherland is forcefully driving off the terrible disaster !
The ocean of love brought together by people of our motherland is bringing you endless hope !
Please do hold on .
With the sense of love and responsibilities of various parties , and with the sincere solidarity and collaboration amongst various parties , we will for sure quickly help you resist the temptation of Azrael , overcome hardships , and rebuild a wonderful homeland !
A number of rescue teams from Japan , Taiwan and Russia , among others , made the request as soon as possible .
China refused on ground that there was no access .
Now it 's clear to everybody that while there 's no access to places like Wenchuan , areas like Dujiangyan and Mianyang , which are home to the largest number of disaster - hit people , have easy access .
There was also a serious shortage of professional rescue teams in these places in the first few says .
If foreign rescue teams could make it there several days earlier , hundreds of lives must have been saved !
As we see now , although Wen Jiabao went to the front line in the first three days , the information then must have been a mess , such that a wrong direction was selected to focus major efforts on .
One principle of the CPC 's way is that it will never let an organization which it ca n't control into an area where information is unavailable .
This is the only reasonable explanation of the CPC 's resolute refusal at that time .
Its symbolic acceptance of several foreign rescue teams later was a helpless move to ease the pressure from domestic and foreign public opinions , after the CPC has regained overall control of the situation in disaster - hit areas .
In order to minimize the " negative " impacts , rescue locations assigned to foreign rescue teams are all those areas that have already been searched and abandoned .
I do n't care how much Wang Shi wastes every time he climbs a mountain , but I do strongly despise how he talks and the way he acts during this whole thing .
After donating , he suggested that charity should not be the burden of businesses , and -LRB- therefore -RRB- stipulated that his company 's employee donations should not exceed 10 yuan .
Totally absurd logic .
Wang Shi 's reasoning is that making donations to charities then the burden of businesses could cause companies to fail in market competition ;
But we can see such philanthropists as Bill Gates , Li Ka - shing , Jackie Chan have not affected the growth of their enterprises in any way .
Instead , they have actually increased the competitiveness of their companies .
And there were some netizens who hit back in the Wang Shi donations issue by admonishing us for forcing donations on moral grounds .
Exactly !
An excellent justification !
If you say that netizens rebuking Wang Shi is forcing donations , then what kind of behavior is Wang Shi preventing employees from donating more than 10 yuan ?
Wang Shi is the economic version of a cold - blooded animal , and we do n't care ,
but , how come he wants to restrict what employees do or do n't do on moral grounds ?
This really is a case of one rule for some , another rule for everyone else !!!
Web site promotion became much more complex and arduous .
From exchanging links , logging on to search engines and information release to mailing lists , maintenance and transmission , every aspect involves professional knowledge .
It is already not a case of just simply studying a few techniques such as Web page construction being able to solve the problem .
But this part is critically important .
Because of this , I have the following advice for Web site promotion in small to medium sized businesses .
Outsource key projects , undertaking other promotional work in - house .
Key projects primarily refer to search engine promotion , and Internet advertising .
China 's domestic search engine and Internet advertising providers are all pushing agent - based systems .
Their authorized agents in any region can be found on the Web site .
Sometimes the price when going through agents is even cheaper than the price quoted by media Web sites themselves .
But if your company does n't have that kind of budget , you can only log in for free on Google .
It 's just that ordinarily , Web site planning and design staff during Web site construction will by no means only consider the Web page optimization issue of Google ranking , so in actual fact if you want to get a good ranking , it is actually pretty difficult .
If you want to carry out search engine optimization , on the one hand it is going to involve expense , but the most important thing is the quality of the optimization .
The third phase was from the Sino - British negotiations on the reversion of Hong Kong to the 6 / 4 massacre in '89 .
During this period , several variables occurred in history .
After Mao Zedong died , the CPC rulers changed their policies .
In terms of economy , reform and opening - up were carried out , and the participation of Hong Kong people was welcomed and encouraged .
Hong Kong people were no longer enemies and running dogs for Britain ; no action would be taken against them despite their previous " defection to the enemy and treason . "
In the 70s , Hong Kong 's economy took off , greatly enhancing the self confidence of Hong Kong people .
At that time , most Hong Kong people were skeptical about the reversion .
Those who had the means fled , carrying money with them .
Even if Hong Kong people at that time were secretly against the reversion , they dared not speak about it , afraid they would be labeled as sinners of the nation .
Those who were reluctant to leave Hong Kong , were impoverished , or were unable to emigrate had the right chance to be " brave Chinese people " for once .
Since Hong Kong people had always felt a sense of identity crisis , most Hong Kong people eventually endorsed the reversion after recalling their painful experience .
Even if they would end up becoming " boat people " in the future , they would rather China did not lose this land .
The patriotism -LRB- not love for the Communist Party -RRB- of Hong Kong people was beyond any doubt .
Moreover , some people even hoped that the reversion of Hong Kong would bring along and influence the development of the mainland in its various areas including politics , economics , society , and rule of law .
Conservative people sincerely hoped that the CPC 's =promise of " No Change for 50 Years " was real .
Even so , donation behavior and the treatment of donation behavior should not deviate from two principles , namely that it is voluntary and does not seek return .
Otherwise , the donation loses its original meaning .
In actual fact , whether it is McDonalds or any other foreign owned enterprises in China on the so - called " international iron rooster " blacklist , they all gave generously to the cause of helping the disaster victims , exhibiting their social responsibility .
Even if by comparison some companies really did n't donate a huge amount , they should not be besieged or subjected to verbal violence in the arena of public opinion .
Donating , after all , is not a legal obligation that companies must carry out .
Urging businesses to donate apart from the force of moral considerations should not take the form of any other coercive means .
As long as a company 's source of income is legal , any compulsory payment outside of legal obligations is a kind of theft .
Even in an abnormal circumstance such as disaster relief , legal order and the rights bestowed upon by law should be respected .
If we are unfortunate enough to be unable to avoid becoming a disaster victim , we can at least preserve the nobility and dignity of humanity and not turn into rabble .
I remember that during the era of Mao Zedong , foreigners who had been to the new China gave our country 's working class a name ; it is called -LRB- blue ants -RRB- .
Before that , in the old China , our country 's laborers were in a disunited state capable of doing nothing .
After =England exported large amounts of opium to our country , causing drugs to run rampant throughout our country , the foreigners also gave us a nickname : " East Asian weaklings . "
And because of this , they bullied our country over and over again , and with the reasonable cooperation of our shameless ruling group , many unfair =traitor treaties were signed .
After the new China was established , the Chinese people rose up under the leadership of the Communist Party led by Chairman Mao .
We drove out the imperialistic foreign firms and their agents , and walked the economic development path of -LRB- independence , self - reliance and self - renovation -RRB- .
At that time , the laborers did n't think much about dressing up or making themselves up , most of them wore blue casual suits .
People were all intent to build up our motherland into a socialist country with people 's democracy and freedom without exploitation or oppression .
After Microsoft withdrew the offer to purchase Yahoo , Jerry Yang published an article on his blog and explained the company 's next plan .
The article read as follows : Yahoo has received widespread attention in the past thirteen weeks .
We have received unprecedented attention from the industry worldwide .
The industry has paid more attention than before to our strategies and our ability to carry out the strategies .
Some people have even suspected whether Microsoft 's purchase offer may distract our attention and raised questions , but we have just started carrying out our strategy .
Those people have underestimated Yahoo 's determination , Yahoo 's spirit , and Yahoo 's culture .
The first quarter of this year may be one of the most exciting quarters in the company history .
We have released innovative products and services , improved our performance , differentiated the users and clients , and purchased Maven Networks Company .
We 've released Buzz , OneSearch 2.0 , Mobile Voice Search , Flickr Video , Shine , and so on .
One important reason that a great number of people buried or trapped in debris in the Wenchuan earthquake - hit area were saved is that they were full of hopes and firmly believed the PLA would come to their rescue !
To settle victims , thousands of tents that stretched miles were soon set up , which contained public toilets , shops , and primary schools and middle schools .
Tens of thousands or even millions of those displaced by the disaster have gradually had a home to shelter from the wind and rain !
If everything were put in the market , such that all the land was sold to syndicates or farm owners , then where should the government set up tents ?
Do they expropriate the land on the spot ?
Even the government can not override the market !
Supporting the disaster - hit areas has tested our competence , while the government 's ability to rule also stood the trial !
At critical moments , the ruling foundation --- workers and farmers , showed staunch support to the government !
If everything were put in the market , such that workers and farmers would have their fates controlled by the market and no longer count on or rely on the government by walking onto a path of the so - called " finding the market rather than the mayor -LRB- government -RRB- , " then what power would the government have ?
The post-catastrophe hyperinflation as expected by foreigners has not come either !
The government has human and financial capital under control , as well as energy and resources !
December 26 , 1975 , Mao Zedong had his 82th birth day , his last one .
Upon turning 80 , Mao Zedong felt apparently that he was old and would die soon .
Therefore , around his birthday those few years , Mao Zedong had always talked about life and death from time to time .
One thing he often said was : " 73 and 84 are ages at which you will be gone even if the King of Hell does n't call you . "
Also since he turned 80 , people had been paying more and more attention to Mao Zedong 's birthday .
Within the country , people dared not celebrate his birthday publicly , so they would celebrate quietly at home .
Local governments dared not present gifts to Mao Zedong , but would convey their blessings to Mao Zedong in various ways .
In the years before Mao Zedong passed away , his hometown Hunan would specially send things like long life noodles on December 26 every year .
For this , Mao Zedong had accepted with pleasure , which was quite unusual .
Outside the country , socialist countries like North Korea would send some gifts such as art ware and food on December 26 every year .
Faced with the incoming telegraphs , letters and gifts for his birthday , Mao Zedong had occasionally been quite unhappy from within , but quite helpless as well .
In fact , even if the Department of Earthquake Monitoring and Predicting was unable to accurately predict an impending quake , a seismic situation forecast would just be as important .
Crying wolf a few more times will not make people think you are lying .
On the contrary , this will increase people 's earthquake awareness , increase the ability of an area to combat earthquakes .
It 's better to be safe than sorry .
The Earthquake Department definitely needs to alter this " rather not report than report wrong " kind of thinking .
The scientific research level is reflected in actual results in earthquake prevention and disaster control , and not reflected through a " successful prediction rate " .
Reporting a few more forecasts of non-destructive earthquakes below magnitude five , cautiously reporting strong earthquakes , powerful earthquakes , will not only improve people 's earthquake awareness , but also will not lead to unnecessary panic .
Otherwise , urban planning , building standards , community life , and school education will have no appropriate earthquake response measures and emergency first - aid mechanisms in place .
-- During the Wenchuan Earthquake , in one particular county town , no suitable flat land could be found to support a helicopter landing , and this is just a small error ?
And those school buildings which gave way at the very outset of proceedings , was it out of the question that it gave us strong enough alert ?
They threw away their weapons .
The kind of plot that can only be found in a martial arts novel is currently playing out in real life in the country 's Earthquake Department .
Later , more and more friends around me who had been using Sinablog have moved , to places including 163blog , Sohublog , and Blogbus .
It seem Sinablog is losing popularity .
Indeed , that interface of Sinablog , I guess , have stayed unchanged for at least two years .
The more I look at it , the grosser it becomes .
A product that stands still will sooner or later be replaced .
-LRB- While I ca n't say Sinablog did n't upgrade at all , as there has been functional upgrades , but there have been few changes to the interface layout . -RRB-
I remember when I worked on the blog previously , I compared quite a few different BSPs and did n't like Sinablog even back then .
I 've registered Sinablog , but have not written many articles or even tried all the functions .
I have n't registered 163blog , but many friends are using it , which looks good .
I 've also registered Baidu Space , also on a trial basis , but it also feels better than Sina 's .
Of course , what I said here is fairly subjective and one - sided , even with a tint of personal bias .
Instead of doing a test , I 'm purely talking about my own feelings .
After organizing donations for disaster relief from staff in my work unit , this party member , in line with standards stipulated by higher authorities , of course , made a further " voluntary contribution " also .
Thinking of how " you can do nothing without money " today , and also how desperate the people of the disaster zone and the public finances of the disaster zone are , this party member was truly happy with this " special effort . "
But on a second thought , I felt that maybe there were many people who ought to feel elated .
In particular , people like He Weifang and Gao Shangquan in the new " Western Hills Meeting " faction , which claims " the Communist Party has broken the law , " are certain to be secretly elated .
Can the people who curse the Communist Party and hope the Communist Party falls from power still have the party spirit , a public spirit and a spirit of compassion for the people ?
Therefore , to say that people like He Weifang will " be secretly elated " is firstly because these devious and sharp - nosed poodles and flunkies of the foreigners will definitely find through these " special party membership dues " that " special party members " are created based on the amounts of their payments of dues , and there will even be " good " cases where some private entrepreneurs are quickly admitted into the party due to their large sums of donations without having to forgo exploitation .
Secondly , they have been extremely aware that for many years , rich upstarts who have used their official powers to seek personal gains and embezzled public money to fatten their private wallets under the pretext of reform are , after all , a handful of leading party cadres in power , and that the vast majority of party members and ordinary cadres in the party not only would find it hard to strike it rich , but would even consider it not bad just to stay out of poverty .
In Chengdu , which is over 100 kms away from the epicenter , the earthquake should not have an intensity of over 7 , or 8 at the most .
There should not be any safety problems for Class A buildings like those at the airport , hospitals and schools that are designed to withstand a intensity of 8 .
So most buildings in Chengdu should still be able to use after emergency assessment , and citizens may go home reassured .
If not so , an investigation should be conducted for any jerry - built projects .
If large sums of money have been spent to provide protection , yet it fails to work when the earthquake comes , such that nobody dares to live at home , is able to use hospitals , or accesses airports , then has the money been thrown for nothing ?
Probably some would say the national building criteria for earthquake resistance was enacted in recent years , and older buildings may not comply with the requirements .
However , at the same time the government enacted the earthquake resistance criteria , it required all existing buildings which did not satisfy the criteria to be reinforced and removed of dangers in a timely fashion .
Thus one can not shirk responsibilities on excuse that it is an old building .
In addition , the government also has criteria for earthquake resistance and prevention for rural buildings .
When I took a look at the headline pictures of the earthquake on the front as well as the following pages of today 's Shenzhen Economic Daily , I invariably noticed the steel reinforcing bars exposed from the broken - off steel reinforced concrete in the collapsed rubble .
I immediately wondered if the grade of this steel reinforced concrete was up to standard ?
What about the quality of the steel reinforcing bars ?
Because I could also clearly see the firm - standing residential buildings and other buildings right beside the collapsed ruins .
Therefore , it is suggested in this post that after the disaster , the builders of all the buildings that completely collapsed or did n't completely collapse should be found .
The builders of the buildings that did n't collapse should be graded up .
The builders of the collapsed buildings should be graded down , and maybe even prosecuted as criminals .
The government should provide financial subsidies to the builders with positive grades and award them with some titles of credibility .
For builders with negative grades , even if no issues of violation of law have been found , what happened to their buildings should still be publicized , and the earthquake - resistance statistics of buildings by some construction companies should be calculated .
After the May 12th Sichuan Earthquake , overseas Chinese throughout the world watched the news each day with tears in their eyes .
However , people discovered very quickly that Wenchuan is anxiously waiting .
The rescue process seemed sluggish , the tears of the Premier failing to move the officials in charge .
Possibly it was a fault in the rescue contingency plan , in that 42 hours after the earthquake struck , rescue workers entering the devastated area of Wenchuan County were forced to proceed on foot for more than 20 hours , at that time an already exhausted and poorly equipped team of only a thousand or so .
When the " golden 72 hours " the elite considered had arrived , within 24 hours the more than a hundred thousand victims trapped in the rubble barely able to breathe looked to just ten thousand - odd , empty - handed rescue workers .
From rescue attempts at the scene , it could easily be seen that to save one person from the rubble required the concerted efforts of at least 3 to 5 people striving manfully for several to dozens of hours in order to achieve a successful rescue .
There were more than 20 million people afflicted in Sichuan this time , affecting an area of one - hundred thousand square kilometers ; in the 58 cities and towns in the most badly - hit area near the epicenter , at least a hundred thousand people were buried in the rubble , which is to say , at the very least , a rescue force of more than 300 thousand needed to be dispatched .
The Chinese government has responded quickly to the earthquake .
At the same time , all of the media , primarily composed of state - owned media , has spared no efforts in presenting the government 's best face to the Chinese people who have united as never before .
This is all helpful for improving the image of the central government , demonstrating that it is responsible and highly efficient .
In the meantime , the great sympathy that the world has shown when facing this disaster has at least for now quieted the criticism of Beijing about Tibet and other issues , while the various sorts of condemnation earlier had cast a shadow over the successful hosting of this summer 's Olympics by Beijing .
Huang Jing , an expert on Chinese political issues at the East Asian Institute -LRB- East Asian Institute -RRB- of the =National University of Singapore , stated that although Chinese leaders clearly would rather this kind of disaster causing tremendous losses of people and property had not occurred , this earthquake has provided a political golden opportunity for Beijing authorities , and they can use this to prove that they have the ability to take good care of the Chinese people and have the ability to resolve this kind of crisis .
These things called blogs are no longer new things , and even many elementary school students now have more than one blog .
How do BSPs compete ?
The technologies are nearly all mutually known , and there are just those few functions .
In circumstances where the functions are identical and the technologies are similar , to win or lose all depends on the details , and you could even say it simply depends on the feel , which is very subtle .
As long as it looks good , it should be fine .
Ordinary web users are not as sophisticated as we are .
They simply need a space that looks good .
If you are slightly better than the others , you can win back the whole world .
But then again , even with a blog as simple as mine here , while I am using it I can still think of so many areas that need improvement .
So , a BSP with so many users must have some areas that need improvement .
If a product turns into one that stops thinking of how to innovate , then it will sooner or later be discarded by the users .
A thing I have recently been using most is QQSpace , and I did n't even considered it a BSP .
There are still many problems with QQSpace , but you can also see many subtle improvements in the details , all to the greater satisfaction of the users .
Faced with a repeatedly delayed so - called airborne rescue operation , Wen Jiabao on the 14th had no alternative but to say to those responsible , " I 'll just say one thing , that is that the people provide you with a living .
Do as you yourselves feel appropriate ! "
The slogan " I am available to secure your victory in any adverse circumstances " shouted out in the news only means that they just have to wait for the rain to stop in order to take to the skies in comfort .
When we saw the first image of the disaster in Wenchuan on the television screen , it was already 43 hours after the earthquake happened .
During this massive earthquake in Wenchuan , the most severely affected Beichuan and Mianzhu were almost razed to the ground , and countless disaster victims were suffering distress across a fissure 300 kilometers in length .
Even though Wen Jiabao had stressed time and again that we must bring help to the disaster area whatever the cost , there were , according to Xinhua News Agency reports , only 20 - plus helicopters heading for the disaster area before the 14th , and it was not until a conference at the anti-quake relief headquarters on the 14th that they decided to request the dispatch of rescue workers by airdrop on the 15th .
By then it was already the fourth day after the quake , and 110 helicopters set off .
Following the Great Wenchuan Earthquake this time , there were compatriots who struggled out of the debris , wiped their tears and buried the bodies of their families , but they braced up again and declared to the world , " we are not beaten down ; we are on our feet again ; the earthquake can not shake the staunch will of the Chinese people ; trials and tribulations serve only to revitalize a nation ! "
This enables us to see the fighting spirits of the dauntless Chinese nation give off a dazzling radiance among people in disaster - hit areas .
The fact that these words are spoken by compatriots who have been through the disaster has given us , who could n't help our tears at the sight of their mishaps , so much comfort and encouragement .
It gives us a hint that no force can beat down the Chinese people .
However , the words -LRB- later -RRB- reappeared somewhere else and from someone unusual , which I thought about for a few days .
I feel , for some unknown reason , it is somewhat scary !
I just want to say , let there be no more disasters , so that China is safe and sound from now on and disasters are far away from China .
I pray to the God to open his eyes and do n't let disasters visit the Chinese land again !
We do n't want to revitalize the nation through trials and tribulations ,
but rather we want to revitalize the nation by passing our days safe and sound !
On May 20 , the McDonald 's in the city of Nanchong , China , was attacked by crowds , as besiegers said the McDonald 's has donated too little for disaster relief .
Meanwhile , a text message of " international iron cocks " is also circulated across China , which blacklists well - known international companies that have made a fortune in China but donated little to the disaster - hit areas .
Klaus Deuse , a reporter with Deutsche Welle , thinks making donations is a moral rather than a legal obligation .
Forced donation is against the meaning of donating and may be suspected of doing violence in charity 's name .
Such a behavior will only hurt the good image that Chinese have presented to the world in the earthquake rescue and relief efforts this time .
Following the great earthquake in Sichuan , China , Chinese people both at home and abroad have become united as never before , demonstrating unprecedented love and philanthropy .
Countless touching stories able to move people to tears have been told during the disaster relief .
People of all social circles , whether rich or poor , have donated generously , showcasing the good quality and moral height of Chinese nationals .
The natural disaster has kindled love and courage of the Chinese people .
Two big words " human nature " were written on earth when the disaster was over .
There have been lots of earthquake documentations since ancient China , as well as many records about observations of the nature .
These are all valuable legacies our ancestors have left us .
Have we treasured them ?
How many people are studying these documentations and records ?
Have those who conduct their research from this perspective received due attention ?
Have their results been applied to practice ?
Western countries lack such historic accumulation -LRB- of course it 's not they do n't have any -RRB- , so they could only rely more on modern technological methods and attach greater importance to the data recorded by instruments .
But we , doing nothing with the valuable experience and precious data left by our ancestors , have been making efforts like fools along Western research directions .
For the science of earthquake observation , maybe experts believe neither toads crossing the street nor birds flushing are reliable , nor are ants climbing trees , mice moving , fish jumping over the pond , and abnormal behaviors of cats and dogs .
Even , sparking wells , abnormal weather , and even the appearance of earthquake clouds are more absurd and unreasonable ....
However , can experts give a reliable way of observation ?
Geoelectricity , magnetic fields and foreshocks ... etc. , or maybe other more advanced acoustic , optic and electric methods , provided that only those observation methods using instruments to record are reliable .
This is typical ruining one 's own skills .
Mao Zedong as with others of his age group , every year would not fail to remember his birthday .
As a leader with sovereign authority , Mao Zedong was entitled to a rousing and extravagantly lavish birthday celebration every year .
However Mao Zedong since his Yan'an days championed a party - wide " no celebration , no gifts " policy .
After the liberation , he was even more about setting the example and strictly forbade the practice of celebrations and gift - giving within the party .
Because of this , Mao Zedong preferred to spend his birthday in a very mundane fashion , and absolutely not set the " celebrating birthday and giving gifts " trend .
During his Yan'an period , Mao Zedong 's life was comparatively quiet , but each year on his birthday he would just add a few extra dishes for dinner at home , the family happily eating a birthday meal together .
December 26 , 1943 was Mao Zedong 's 50th birthday .
In China , the 50th birthday is known as a ' major birthday ' , and there were people in Yan'an preparing to put on a celebration for Mao Zedong , but Mao Zedong steadfastly refused .
And so Mao Zedong 's 50th birthday crept by in the flames of war and smoke of guns .
On December 26 , 1953 , Mao Zedong turned 60 .
This is a " huajia " birthday , which Chinese people have valued since antiquity ; Mao Zedong also thought a lot of this transition , since after huajia he could be addressed as an elderly person .
But Mao Zedong just arranged a small spread at home , celebrating by himself .
After the nineties , state - owned engineering enterprises stopped recruiting construction workers .
But that is n't to say they stopped hiring people , but those they took in were all graduates with professional diplomas from polytechnic schools , technical colleges , and universities ; these staff all went into management .
During the early nineties , the formal employees of this enterprise still had complete working teams , such as bricklaying teams , woodwork teams , steel reinforcement teams , and machinery maintenance teams , but since they could not cope with a large volume of project tasks , they were already cooperating with some migrant worker units , in other words the familiar " contracting gangs " .
A collision occurred between tradition and reality .
Due to formal working units no longer taking on young employees , working units got increasingly older and broken up .
Some staff -LRB- extremely few -RRB- entered management .
A few exceptional former team leaders gradually became project managers .
Others became materials officers , safety officers and quality control officers , etc .
Those without connections became staff monitoring the construction site ------ similar to the security guards of today .
The workers no longer formed complete operating teams .
And at this time , migrant worker units gained an opportunity to develop .
The entire on - site operation work was all carried out by contracting gangs .
Working units disbanded .
The status of these workers was also changing .
On the same day around 9 in the morning , the morning market held in the square in front of the city hall went ahead as usual .
If not for the " Media Please Enter " sign , perhaps nobody could tell that an important activity would take place here .
Passing through the maze - like corridors of the city hall , security personnel carefully inspected the clothing of reporters , even taking an on - the - spot photo with their cameras before letting them through .
At approximately 9:30 the Dalai , with a retinue including the Mayor of Bochum , attendants and at least six bodyguards entered the hall .
He pulled out his trademark smile , repeatedly placing his palms together , pausing now and then to shake hands and embrace with journalists lining the corridors .
After shaking hands with a German reporter next to China 's International Herald Leader journalist , he suddenly looked back to discover an Asian face .
The Dalai walked back again to shake hands , and patted the journalist on the shoulder , saying in Chinese " Hello ! Hello ! "
Following the commencement of the press conference , the Dalai expressed his gratitude to the host for his invitation and organizing work , all the while with his palms placed together , smiling fatuously from time to time .
It is exactly these childish fun - like poses that he relies on to impress Europeans , and this day was no exception , with " knowing laughter " from the foreign journalists at frequent intervals .
However , the Dalai made not the slightest mention of the Sichuan earthquake that had only just struck , at that time the life and death of nationals including many fellow Tibetan countrymen caught in the earthquake were still unknown .
The year 2008 is destined to be one we will never forget .
Just as we were filled with joyful anticipation of the advent of the grand Olympic Games , one crisis event after another is rendering our mood more complex .
I suspect no nation holding the Olympics had an experience like ours during the Olympic year .
Since the massive earthquake occurred in Wenchuan in Sichuan , whenever we 've gazed at the disaster scenes brought to us on the television screen , we could n't accept and did n't dare to face the huge damage done to our nation by these sudden disasters .
The Chinese people 's dauntless national spirit was once again unfolded , behind the figure of the premier in particular , this 66 - year - old premier who was just the same as an ordinary old Chinese person , rushing about the disaster zones .
How often , as we felt compassion for the loss of a myriad lives in an instant , did the disaster relief feats by all walks of society make us feel the greatness of the Chinese nation !
At the same time , we also saw the state 's emergency response and the transparency of public information release , and this also won the praise and respect of the nation and the world at the same time as the harm caused by the calamity was being mitigated .
The resolution and fearlessness displayed by state leaders faced by the disaster has given us even more confidence and courage for the future .
Not long ago , a piece of sensational news emerged .
The US Department of State 's Bureau of Consular Affairs released a directive calling for US citizens heading to Beijing to raise their guard :
China 's guesthouses and hotels would be installing listening devices .
They were going to fully monitor every single foreign guest .
In response to this sort of lie , China politely offered a denial .
At times , Chinese people can show surprising restraint .
For example Iceland singer Bjork gave a concert in Shanghai on March 2 , and while performing a number " Declare Independence " loudly shouted out " Tibet " ; China continued to treat her as a privileged guest .
Actually China was well within its rights to declare that Bjork with this act crudely interfered with China 's domestic politics .
In the end it was left to the Deputy Ministry of Culture to step up and make a few relevant comments .
Not long before , Hollywood director Spielberg openly announced he was quitting his post as artistic advisor for the Olympic Games .
Of course , China can still successfully hold an Olympics without Hollywood celebrities , but the insult and damage were already inflicted .
Of course , the higher the level of fortification , the more money it will =cost .
What 's the significance of this kind of fortification ?
The significance is when an earthquake really strikes , safety can be guaranteed for the buildings that meet earthquake - resistance standards .
Take commercial buildings for example .
Level eight fortification means that if the earthquake intensity of the local area is below the seventh level , a commercial building will not be damaged , will not need repairs , and can continue to be used normally .
If earthquake intensity reaches the eighth level , commercial buildings can continue to be used after necessary repairs , but will not collapse and people 's lives and safety will not be threatened .
If earthquake intensity reaches the ninth level , commercial buildings will not collapse and will not threaten people 's lives and safety .
Our country still does n't have fortification standards higher than level 9 ; the basic intensity of most areas is level 7 .
That is to say , if the national standards for earthquake resistance were strictly enforced , buildings should n't collapse .
With so much said , now we can start analyzing the questions concerning the collapse of the school buildings and public buildings .
Why did so many school buildings and hospitals =crack and collapse so severely in this earthquake ?
Many people suspect there had been jerry - built projects , which is understandable .
But proof and scientific analysis are required to prove this suspicion .
A suggestion to the Chinese government , that is more precautions are now needed instead in earthquake - prone areas where earthquakes have n't occurred .
There should be an appropriate policy for buildings in these areas .
My opinion seems to be so long as a city is not in the epicenter , if a building is extremely sturdy , then it would be able to stand the earthquake without collapsing .
Regarding this , I think buildings in Taiwan Province are also worth learning from .
As I remember , when an earthquake struck Taiwan Province , I noticed on TV that while many residential buildings were already tilted , they just did not collapse , which created opportunities for people to survive .
If seems a concrete - structured building is comparatively sturdy , since it 's a whole .
For some buildings that collapsed in this earthquake , such as collapsed school buildings that buried students underneath , if there are any quality problems with the construction , the builders should be held accountable .
I remember during the Turkish earthquake last time , many real estate developers that made shoddy buildings were held accountable .
I was startled to hear about the Sichuan earthquake , where nearly ten thousand people have already died , and I could n't help feeling panicked .
Though I do n't have any relatives there , we all are Chinese , compatriots in China , and at this moment of calamity , we can not refrain from extending a helping hand , we must do all we can to console our countrymen who have died tragically as well as our own consciences .
At the dinner table , our whole family , including my 13 - year - old daughter and nearly 4 - year - old son , unanimously agreed that we would make a donation for the disaster - stricken people .
My daughter decided to contribute a portion from the money she earns from her mom and dad by doing chores around the house .
Saving the country from disaster is the duty of us overseas Chinese , and it is also the fine tradition of us overseas Chinese .
When the 1911 Revolution broke out back then , overseas Chinese made donations of money and supplies , even directly participating in the revolution , shedding their blood in sacrifice and making a huge contribution for the revolutionary cause in the period of modern China .
When the Japanese aggressors invaded our rivers and mountains , Tan Kah Kee rose and issued a call .
Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia almost emptied their wallets to donate up to more than 20 million yuan , and along with the remittances overseas Chinese sent to their relatives in China , the total was as huge as several hundred million -LRB- see Tan Kah Kee 's " Memoirs of An Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia " -RRB- , constituting the most important source of foreign exchange for the national government at that time .
Even in the early 80's following the reform and opening - up , the policy of the Chinese government of inviting foreign capital actually did not attract much investment from the West .
The investments from overseas Chinese still constituted a primary source of foreign capital in that period .
Please do not tell me you know both China and the West .
I know many of you are very ignorant about China and have a deep prejudice against the West .
Unlike us , you did n't experience the hard process of ideological emancipation in China , rinsing out bit by bit the toxic liquid infused into the marrow in the Old Mao era and crystallizing the need for individuality emancipation , freedom and democracy from your own life 's experiences .
Many of you have n't even rinsed off the brands imprinted in the era of the Red Guards .
Some still harbor the Utopia ideal of the era of educated youth , with uncured masochism left from the Old Mao era and still indulging in your memory of Old Mao and vilification of Deng Xiaoping .
You will feel uncomfortable if you are not tortured and envy your compatriots seeing them continue to be tortured .
Many of you only deal with Chinese and kill time day and night before CCTV , indulging in rubbish Chinese soap operas that no one will watch even in China .
I doubt exactly how many of you in the protesting crowd watched CNN 's " China - insulting " words and how many could understand .
Speaking of Chinese traitors , it has always been a concept taken seriously by our countrymen in traditional Chinese culture .
Our countrymen =bitterly hate Chinese traitors .
But since the reform and opening - up , with the worship of everything foreign becoming fashionable , this concept has been continuously challenged .
Therefore , in order to deepen our understanding of what Chinese traitors and their harm are , enhance our concept of nationality , and take action to resolutely combat treason , it is extremely necessary to analyze the differences and similarities between the ancient and modern Chinese traitors .
Chinese traitors , as the name implies , are something after the two Han Dynasties in Chinese history .
But the concepts of patriotism and treason appeared as early as in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States period .
The characteristics of the states in that period and those of the states after that greatly changed .
At that time , traitors who were intellectuals such as Su Qin and Zhang Yi were as numerous as could be and almost became fashionable , but in the end , as most of them sold themselves to the Qin state , and later , because " the Qin emperor swept across the world , with a majestic glare of a tiger , " and China was reunited , no one brought it up any more .
As for patriots , people only remember one person , Qu Yuan . Because Qu Yuan wrote excellent poetry , and there is the Dragon - Boat Festival , his story has been passed down till now .
Well - known traitors in China like Qin Kuai , Zhang Bangchang , Wang Jingwei , and the like were universally condemned , which actually happened later on .
In 1955 , U.S. cartoon magnate Walt Disney set up the first modern style amusement park in California , moving in one by one all the vivid animated characters from his films .
In this amusement park , named after Disney himself , not only could children play with life - sized cartoon figures , they could also drive futurized cars , ride in Mississippi - style paddle steamers , lose themselves in medieval castles , or take a stroll through the streets of America .
From then on , Disneyland became the promised land dreamed about by countless kids all over the world , influencing generation after generation of little and not - so - little kids .
After more than half a century , Disneyland 's fame and appeal continues to grow , creating astonishing wealth for the Disney group .
Theme parks account for forty percent of Disney 's annual revenue .
But who could have thought that the vast majority of the value created by this theme park is derived from services .
Recently , while I was reading a book on management , I had this feeling of being suddenly enlightened .
The book said that the Disneyland in Tokyo , Japan was packed to the brim with crowds everyday .
Since May 12 , lists of " top donors " have appeared on all major domestic portals .
The amount of donation has become the moral scale that measures how much love there is .
Quite a few busyboys have even dug out the personal property and privacy of some rich people who are considered to have donated less than enough , to reveal their being rich but cruel and lack of love to repay society .
In quite a few places , there 's also the phenomenon of intentionally seeking media effects of the donation by redoing it before a video camera .
An old speech made six years ago by Ma Yun , chairman of the Board of Directors of the commercial portal Alibaba , about making donations was also used to create a hype , resulting in moral condemnation by online opinions .
Just as donating is a person 's active moral obligation , not donating is their passive legal right .
In a society that truly respects human dignity , while everyone enthusiastically makes a donation , it must not be a society where people morally try , put before the public and sneer at those who donate nothing or less .
A society that is humane and full of love must also be a tolerant society .
In a tolerant society , we should say " thank you " to even to donations of only one cent .
Once a former reporter of official CCP Central News Agency , but afterwards imprisoned twice spanning seven years for daring to lift the lid on CCP corruption , senior journalist Gao Yu described the CCP 's current control on news as editing its content like a movie before release to the public .
She also noted the so - called patriotic " angry youth " phenomenon that is currently shocking Western society reminded her of the blind arrogance during the Cultural Revolution .
Its roots lie in the CCP 's long - standing blockade of press freedom .
Gao Yu said , " it 's like the kind of exclusion of Western media that occurred during the Cultural Revolution , the exclusion of Western governments in circumstances where we were so poor that five people could n't afford one pair of trousers but still behaved in an arrogant and proud fashion .
I think that China has again fallen into a very foolish , a -LRB- ridiculously savage -RRB- sort of atmosphere ; approaching the kind of political status displayed by the Nazi youth league in Germany before the Berlin Olympic Games .
How could this have come about ?
How can our China have such an astonishing large amount of angry youth ?
I think it is closely related to the lack of press freedom in China . "
Whether the Cultural Revolution was correct or not , the CCP launched it after legally passing it through resolution documents and assembly form .
The decision to bring out the Cultural Revolution was approved by the vast majority in the Central Committee - not only Mao Zedong , Zhou Enlai , Zhu De , and Lin Biao endorsed it , but also Liu Shaoqi , Deng Shaoping , Chen Yun and such old revolutionaries threw in their votes of endorsement .
While after the Cultural Revolution , the CCP official and media 's verdict on the Cultural Revolution was that it was internal disorder and disaster , and their denouncing as counter-revolutionaries of Lin Biao , Jiang Qing and those leaders , cadres , and numerous red guards who had faithfully executed CCP policy was absurd in the extreme .
If the Cultural Revolution was wrong , it went wrong with the Party headquarters , with Chairman Mao .
If Lin Biao and the " Gang of Four " had a problem , it was that they were extreme left , no question of being counter-revolutionaries , rather that they revolted a bit too much .
The CCP Cultural Revolution is a part of CCP history , it can not be cut out ,
and during it , many good things at least did happen .
It can not be simply written off as internal disorder and disaster .
Trying to deliver a verdict on the Cultural Revolution whilst in a parochial and emotional frame of mind is incredibly frivolous , incredibly flippant and it will certainly not stand up to the test of time , and will be laughed at .
In being determined to make the Cultural Revolution , which the CCP passed through formal legal assembly , out as a counter-revolutionary incident , saying it was internal disorder and disaster is the CCP smearing itself , totally uncalled for , and is the second absurdity in the CCP 's history .
Nine Dragons Paper successfully went public in Hong Kong on March 3 , 2006 .
Owning 72 % of the shares , Cheung Yan is honored as " the Dragon Queen of Waste Paper . "
On the television she looks plain and approachable , just like the " girl next door . "
But , it is this " Dragon Queen " who has built a fortune starting as a wage earner , who shrewdly and effectively put forward these three proposals : " exemptions from permanent work contracts , " " reducing the tax burden on the wealthy , " and " a transitional tax - exempt period for business imports of environmental protection equipment . "
This wage earner who built her fortune from scratch has finally completed the entire process from a worker to a spokesperson for the bosses , and totally sides with the bosses .
If you think this is someone who has experienced life as a worker and who will be always soft on the workers to some extent and will still have a bit of compassion left for her same kind when she becomes a boss , then you are wrong .
The three proposals of the Dragon Queen , as well as the likes of " sweatshops " which have come under heavy criticism , have mercilessly smashed people 's illusions .
Wang Shi 's experience of being under public condemnation underscored to a certain extent the tense relationship between the rich and poor classes in Chinese society ; because as China grows prosperous day by day , the gap of wealth between the successful elite and the remaining 1.3 billion people is widening .
Thirty years ago , people had basically the same incomes , which were all deplorably meager .
However , Hurun Report -LRB- Hurun Report -RRB- shows that by 2007 , there were a total of 106 billionaires -LRB- in U.S. dollars -RRB- in China , with the number of people only next to that of the United States .
Now , Wang Shi said , these responses have had effects on me .
He admitted that he was not sensitive enough to the current situation when he wrote his blog .
Wang Shi noted additionally that since China currently has not yet established a sound system of social security insurance , the growing hatred of the rich is unavoidable .
On Tuesday , Wanke announced that it would make an additional donation of RMB 100 million yuan for the temporary resettlement and post-disaster reconstruction in the next three to five years .
Yao Ming , the basketball player who was hailed as a national hero thanks to his success in establishing himself in NBA , was also blamed after he announced his donation of RMB two million yuan because a rumor on the Internet alleged he had donated one million U.S. dollars for disaster relief of Hurricane Katrina -LRB- Hurricane -RRB- in 2005 .
Imagine for a moment what would the scene have been like if the earthquake had struck in a fully - marketized China ?
In that time , the government itself would clearly not have the same power as it has now .
With no state - owned enterprises , no family collectives either , everything individualized -LRB- privatized -RRB- , no resources in the hand , the government would need to depend on the conduct of the rich .
Furthermore , who is left for the government to rule in " small government , big society " ?
Are n't they doing parachute drops ?
With no oil for aviation , petroleum refining in the hands of the capitalists , who would you go to ?
Right now , one word , one phone call and it 's done !
Not done ?
Only if he did n't want the job !
Say the earthquake zone really needs tents and the central government directly gives the order for manufacturers to start planning - how much they need , when they should be ready - who would dare to disobey ?
They would n't dare to disobey , and also would n't dare to raise prices arbitrarily .
If everything was privatized , market - operated , and the government purchased on a large scale , supplying factories would grab the chance to drive up prices , and flog off shoddy seconds as high - quality products .
And so , cases like the evil - minded capitalists in Shanghai swindling the people we loved the most during the time of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea would re-emerge .
As far as handling of the issue of the " Gang of Four " goes , till now , people are still striving for merit and fawning on .
Little do they know that breaking up the " Gang of Four " is an illegal , disdainful coup that violates internal party regulations .
Any struggle in the CPC history has always been completed through legitimate conventions .
It does n't matter whether or not the content is right , such as Gao Gang , Peng Dehuai , Liu Shaoqi , Hua Guofeng , Hu Yaobang , and Zhao Ziyang ; and also Chen Duxiu , Qu Qiubai , Li Lisan , Bo Gu , Wang Ming , and so on , the rules and procedures were all followed .
But the handling of the " Gang of Four " violated procedures .
Here I 'm not saying whether or not the handling of Jiang Qing and the other people was wrong , I 'm just saying that the method of handling was ridiculous .
The way that Hua Guofeng 's people handled the issue of Jiang Qing was completely different from the way that Deng Xiaoping later handled the issue of Jiang Qing .
The way Hua Guofeng handled the " Gang of Four " was a power struggle .
The starting point was not a struggle of political courses , but of personal ambition .
Hua Guofeng and Jiang Qing were on the same political course .
The struggle between Deng Xiaoping and the " Gang of Four " was over political course disagreements , and not a fight over personal power .
For people like Hua Guofeng and Wang Dongxing , within the party a proposal for a =just treatment would be made sooner or later .
The Communist Party of China should not , under any circumstances , allow any illegal feuds within the party to happen again .
It is said that our country 's earthquake forecasting is at an advanced level in the world .
But the glory of the earthquake workers did not produce good luck for the departed spirits of Wenchuan .
So , we again hear expert figures emphasizing once again , " Earthquake forecasts are a global challenge that so far no one has been able to solve . "
We should offer earthquake workers our full understanding .
Facing the caprice of nature , humankind is really insignificant .
Furthermore , although our sense of security increases with each passing day in line with " significant advances achieved " in seismology , we can not look to anyone to give us any promises . Because , once someone has made a promise , he would be doomed thereafter to bear this bloody weight of " being unable to effectively avoid earthquake disasters . "
And by not issuing any promises , he could actually avoid being censured . Because " there is no way to make predictions " !
Things for Improvement as Exposed in the Disaster Rescue Effort I 'm not writing this article to criticize anyone .
As I was not personally on the scene , I definitely ca n't grasp the main threads of the matter with accuracy .
Here I 'm simply writing down a few thoughts of mine .
In the fallout of the Wenchuan earthquake this time , the PLA entered disaster - hit areas for rescue as soon as they could .
Due to the urgency in time and unprecedented transparency in news reports , I 've been able to see some of the things more clearly than before .
First , the progress of the PLA these years are certainly able to be fully reflected .
I think the most important progress is the improvement in its strategic airlifting capacity .
With imported IL - 76 and homemade Y - 8 , the PLA Air Force airlifted several dozen thousand people to disaster - hit areas within an extremely short period of time .
Troops like those of the Jinan Military Area Command were entirely airlifted , which was definitely unimaginable before .
However , personally I think a larger number of problems have been exposed :
1. Reconnaissance capabilities are seriously lacking .
The epicenter , Wenchuan , was insulated from the outside world following the earthquake , making it hard for the command and people of the entire nation to know the situation at the epicenter , at which time the PLA 's various reconnaissance measures should have been of great use , yet the result was hugely surprising .
The disastrous snow storms had just passed when rioting and violence broke out in Lhasa again .
Now a powerful earthquake has struck in Sichuan 's Wenchuan , this misfortune - plagued homeland of mine .
The earthquake disaster neatly coincided with the Olympic torch relay within China .
The attack of the quake for a time stripped away the luster from the Olympic torch relay , and it lost its significance .
The torch relay is a kind of symbol , it symbolizes luck , peace , unity , and spirit ; it arouses the nationalistic passion of the people , awakens the people 's patriotic zeal .
The transfer of the Olympic torch clearly brings with it a kind of intense rejoicing and an atmosphere of warmth .
But all this has dissipated because of the quake , disappearing without a trace .
Can the torch still continue to be passed on the same way it was in the past ?
I 'm afraid it can not .
Continuing the relay will in the first case chill the hearts of the people in the quake zone , and then serve to chill the hearts of every citizen in the country .
Because of this , putting an end to the torch relay is a very necessary action .
When compared with earthquake relief , with the suffering of people in the disaster zone , the Olympic torch relay is not worth talking about .
What China needs now is all the people with one mind working hand in hand for the rescue effort .
In the first case , let 's clear up an extremely retarded error in understanding - that is the belief that helicopters can do anything , can fly anytime they like , go to anyplace - this is Hollywood blockbusters , this is not fact .
Actually , helicopters are the weakest type of aircraft in the world .
They ca n't fly on the plateau , ca n't fly in mountainous areas , ca n't fly in rain and wind : that is to say , they are most useful in places like Iraq .
But when it came to attacking the Southern Alliance , the US Apache helicopter squadron lost 4 aircraft for no apparent reason while changing bases in the middle of the day .
During the entire period of the Kosovo war -LRB- Kosovo being a mountainous region -RRB- , America 's armed helicopters did not execute a single effective combat mission .
Why ?
Because they were totally unable to take off , the wind in the valleys was lethal to helicopters - the minute they took off they were blown into the mountains .
In that case , is it OK not to fly in the valleys , just fly above the mountain tops then ?
Normally it 's possible , but in this particular earthquake it is n't possible .
Because Wenchuan County is in a valley , you must descend in order to be able to conduct a rescue .
In addition , for Wenchuan , this sort of place lying on the edge of the plateau , ordinary helicopters can not necessarily fly up there .
A helicopter used specifically for plateaus may be required .
Although Wen Jiabao then requested that access to disaster - hit areas be made available by midnight the 13th , it was until 21.30 hours on the 15th that relevant rescuers connected the road from Li County to Wenchuan for the first time , which was already 79 hours after the earthquake .
It should be noted that at the time , rescuers were still unable to access 34 of the 58 townships affected by the disaster .
Everyone who has read Li Bai 's poem knows , " the roads in Shu are so harsh that they are even harsher than going to the sky , " which indicates how harsh and dangerous geographical conditions are in Sichuan .
The mankind is now in the 21st world .
Under the modern technological conditions , two methods , midair helicopters and quick road repair by ground engineers and technicians , should be the preferred effective methods to rescue people in emergency situations in the great mountainous areas of Sichuan .
When quick road connection on the ground encounters difficulties , accessing disaster - hit areas by air should be more efficient .
It 's true that faced with such a great disaster , it 's more crucial to repair damaged roads .
And it must rely on well - trained and flexible professional technical teams with hands - on experience who would " carve out a road at a mountain and set up a bridge at a river . "
However , none of these were realized .
Allowing citizens freedom of expression would make the government continually improve its ability to rectify mistakes .
Clashes engendered by the intensity of conflicts between some local governments and the general public have created very bad social effects .
An important reason is that prior to this , people 's channels for freedom of expression were blocked , and that in apparently calm seas it is easy for the helmsmen to relax vigilance .
Hence , some local governments always believe themselves to be definitely right when it comes to public policymaking .
And when the situation has developed to a considerable extent , for example , a large project has already absorbed huge preliminary funds and a contradiction suddenly erupts , the government departments concerned will find themselves caught in an impasse , with huge social costs to be borne no matter how it is dealt with .
If the government wants to make fewer errors , then it should allow the people freedom of expression .
When Gun tried to control the floodwaters , he was unable to stop the billowing floodwaters with soil , and was finally killed by Shun on Yushan .
His son , Yu the Great , took a different approach from his father 's , and adopted the dredging method , calming the floodwaters several years later .
We can catch a glimpse of the political wisdom of the ancient Chinese from this ancient myth , whose message remains valid till the present day .
Li Kaifu once said , Google 's future lies in *integrated search* -LRB- or universal search -RRB- .
My understanding of integrated search is that search results by other products are included in web search - the most important product of a search engine , because normally web search has the largest number of users .
This way , users do n't have to compare and choose from a large variety of search products today .
Integrated search also embodies the trend to make search engines intelligent .
As search result integration is based on analyzing and judging the function of key words , if a user types the key word " scenery " in Google , Google 's understanding is that the user wants to find images about " scenery , " rather than an introduction about " scenery . "
Thus by adding results of image search to the results , it has realized intelligent search .
Moreover , in the area of furthering earthquake precautions , the entire globe has not seen much improvement .
However , I do believe that at least in the few seconds just before an earthquake strikes , for example say five seconds or even ten seconds before , there would be a small vibration that the human body can not detect .
Even though people can not feel it , instruments ought to be more sensitive .
The minute it is felt by the instruments , if it is possible to sound an alarm on the streets ten seconds ahead of time , giving people a chance to get under desks , then perhaps that would save a lot of lives .
Of course , because modern instruments are very sensitive , they are frequently interfered with by the sound of people 's footsteps , the roar of vehicles , and so on .
But the likely emission pattern of these man - made sounds is distinct from the pattern of underground tremors , so this is asking our country 's pattern recognition workers to put some time and effort into trying to distinguish these sounds from tremors , try to separate underground vibrations from the vibrations caused by people .
This ought to be technologically feasible .
I feel that for many years there have been problems with the work orientation of the Earthquake Administration .
Many experts at the Earthquake Administration all put their minds to work on how to forecast earthquakes , but it is very difficult to make great progress in a short time in this work .
Therefore , it is necessary for the Earthquake Administration to focus their work on how to prepare against earthquakes .
Japan is an earthquake - prone country , where earthquake experts do a great deal of earthquake simulation and modeling , simulating various kinds of circumstances when earthquakes occur .
For example , they postulate that a 7.0 magnitude or stronger earthquake occurring in the Tokyo city center will result in derailed subways , with tens of thousands of people trapped underground , while the large embankment of a river in the north called Arakawa will collapse , causing water to flood into the subterraneous streets .
When this sort of the worst situation occurs , 100,000 people would die in Tokyo .
There are many similar simulations , and many cities such as Nagoya and Osaka have all their own earthquake disaster simulations and have made contingency plans against earthquakes based on these simulations .
Besides training the public to move in a safe direction when an earthquake occurs , they also make the government strengthen the large embankments or construct dual embankments , to prolong the time it takes for the great quantity of water to get to the subway tunnels .
In addition they also conduct experiments on all kinds of housing structures , to see which kinds of houses collapse in which situations .
" As long as the state cares for the common people and takes the people 's lives and rights as its key principle -- as long as there is this kind of basic consensus , the ethical foundation of the harmony of the whole people and the harmony of China and the whole world will be established .
The entire world will extend its support to us , and the whole of mankind will share our joys and woes .
We will make progress along the broad path of human rights , the rule of law , and democracy together with the world . "
A feudal monarch can pay lip service to " caring for the common people , " and a capitalist can also pay lip service to " caring for the common people , " but they both actually carry out life - sucking exploitation of the people .
The socialist cause is the cause of the people themselves .
They can defend it with their lives .
They must rely on themselves and liberate themselves in order to achieve it , and need not any other people to " care for the common people " and " take the lives and rights of the people as their key principle . "
The elite are fond of talking about " equal rights , " and " the right to life " should be the most equal one , should n't it ?
However , the elite are just giving " equal protection " to " mines of gold " of the rich and to the " sticks " the beggars use to drive away dogs .
How could this show the equality in the " right to life ? "
Big real - estate developers proclaim , " We do not think of the poor ! "
The great elite proclaims , " It is stupid to sacrifice yourself for other people ; it was the sweatshops that were not making allowance for the workers ! "
It is Western imperialism that is out of kilter with China !
After Lee Teng - hui put forth the " two states theory " , due to mainland countrymen being deceived by the CCP 's propaganda machine , many people advocated using force to unite Taiwan .
Because they have no understanding whatsoever of the situation in Taiwan and the will of the Taiwan people , they universally exhibited extreme nationalistic sentiment .
Just like the love - hate fusion of nationalistic war sentiment that erupted after the US mistakenly bombed the Chinese embassy .
They similarly did not understand the real story in Kosovo .
But Hong Kong people realize that first there was the Republic of China , only after that came " New China " ; While this " Two States Separatist Theory " has purely and simply been dreamed up by the CCP .
Lee Teng - hui was doing nothing but bringing an already existing phenomenon to light .
Moreover , the grand old men of the CCP who handed over on a silver platter a huge chunk of land in Manchuria north of the Amur River to Soviet Russia , who gave away land equivalent to ten percent of national territory in northern Mongolia ; why not take this back , instead of insisting on trying to grab back a Taiwan that remains in the hands of Chinese people ?
However , even though Hong Kong people have their grumbles , the " two states theory " has in no way triggered a sentimental attachment in Hong Kong people for " Old China " .
It is a pity that in this unprecedented and enthusiastic surge of donation some phenomena occurred that run counter to the original meaning of donation .
If we do not ponder and reexamine this promptly , it will affect the formation of a sustainable and mature donation culture in Chinese society .
Being voluntary and asking for no return are the two major principles of making donations .
Lack of either of the two would make donations taxes or transactions of sale and purchase .
It is voluntary because the donor is following his inner call of morality , rather than an external legal obligation or the fear of sanctions .
When no return is sought , making donations can then assume no nature of exchange of interests on the one hand ,
and on the other hand , more importantly , it also distinguishes donations from handouts .
It wo n't make the beneficiary feel a sense of inequality due to his dependency and need to feel grateful .
Therefore , if donations are not anonymous , at least efforts should be made to prevent the formation of direct one - to - one relationship between the donor and the beneficiary .
Accepting donations should have an extent .
We ca n't accept or not refuse to take donations from everyone and then trumpet on about love and compassion , while giving no thought to whether doing this is or is not lacking in humanity .
Exactly - these poor people donations really are worth calling attention to , but for humane sake , can we accept their donations ?
We ca n't be on the one hand treating the rich , treating the capitalists generously and being exceptionally miserly with the poor , while at the same time not =passing up even the rent money from these kind of poor old guys .
Exactly - elderly people donating is their voluntary will , an expression of the elderly 's compassion .
But , what about the love of this nation 's community for the elderly - does it really love old people ?
Accepting this sort of donation from the poverty - stricken poor , on the surface appears as if out of humanity .
Even though the poor may be clothed in rags , they quite clearly stand on the moral high ground .
However , whether we look at it from its pattern or from its implications , accepting such donations from the poor is precisely what causes us to lose the most basic humanity .
If our country has set up a welfare system guaranteeing the peoples ' maternity , retirement , health and funeral expenses , guaranteeing the basic necessities of life , nobody could possibly have objections to accepting these donations from the poor .
But have we done this ?
I guess the leaders might be feeling a bit fed up recently .
Wang Dong just finished saying free oneself from old ideas , emancipate the mind , when out comes some Hong Kong extreme left - wing students exposing and criticizing " sweat shops " .
Guangdong Province Federation of Trade Unions bosses personally investigated the matter and shot the whole so - called " sweat shop " factories matter down in flames , not dreaming that the specter of " child labor " would then rear its head .
How could a child labor problem arise ?
The brilliant experts and professors immediately identified the root of the problem : Poverty is the real reason !
I have no use for the current crop of intellectuals .
Most of them are all really stupid , do n't know one end of academia from the other , while a few clever ones are overdoing it , and are busy being lackeys for the bureaucrats and private entrepreneurs .
For example , today 's experts often ask : why do " sex workers " always come back ?
This is also due to poverty .
Although we know that " Poverty is not Socialism " , however I suppose with poverty must come child labor ? Must come " sex workers " ?
Poverty is only one cause leading to the problems of child labor and " sex workers " , and is by no means a totally necessary prerequisite . Because for such a substantial period of history , China although still very much in " poverty " , was able to deal with the issues of child labor and " sex workers " in a way unparalleled in history .
The factory managers of those times , had they been even bolder , would never have entertained the thought of exploiting child labor ;
The intellectuals of those times , had they been even more liberated , would not have dared to drum up support for the " out in the sunshine " management of " sex workers " .
Today , although our country has become much richer , with the increase in the size of homes and businesses comes huge waste .
Every year regions in China suffer from droughts , floods , snowstorms , earthquakes and other such natural disasters .
The Premier 's billions in special expenditure were mainly used in helping the disaster victims .
Although China has a lot of foreign exchange reserves , such reserves are used for purchasing foreign things .
And also these foreign exchange reserves are China 's in name , but in actual fact have owners -LRB- businesses -RRB- , and the country can not call upon them to spend at will .
If we want to use them , this can only happen after buying them with RMB from the owners ,
If a trillion in foreign exchange reserves was used , the country would then have to issue more than 7 trillion RMB to pay the owners of the foreign exchange reserves .
This would ruin the currency issue regulation policy of the People 's Bank , creating inflation .
Only with donations from abroad can the country spend freely and resolve this pressing situation .
I appeal to the overseas students , particularly those overseas Chinese countrymen who have a green card or citizenship and middle class people with family incomes to the tune of 100 - thousand , to hold on to the donations going to your American alma mater or church , and pledge them to your own motherland , donate them to your countrymen who are still locked in the struggle for existence !
At present , our nation 's law encompasses all the laws and procedures made by the country 's relevant authorities regarding Internet banking and online electronic payments .
The already - enacted " China Electronic Signature Law " came into effect on April 1 , 2005 .
It confirmed that electronic signatures enjoy equal legal status with handwritten signatures and stamps .
" Electronic Payment Guidelines -LRB- No. 1 -RRB- " released by the People 's Bank designated that customers not using digital certificates during online banking payments will be limited to 1000 yuan with each transaction ; while " Online Banking Management Measures " issued by the CBRC stipulated that opening an online bank must undergo a valid assessment and be ratified by the CBRC .
In addition , " Certificate Verification Management Procedure " -LRB- CSP -RRB- stipulated the duties and obligations between the verifying agency CA and the certificate 's user ; this is a supplement to the law , the criteria for CA management operation .
However , with today 's huge development in the digital economy , when electronic online payments have already become a bottleneck for the growth of electronic business , the above laws and regulations are far from satisfying objective requirements . Such as the formulating of electronic transaction law , revision of accounting law , revision of the law on negotiable bills of exchange , as well as the revision of contract law , etc etc .
An old Chinese saying goes " being in a different trade is like being in another world . "
So if virtually unrelated trades , such as trading timbers , selling miscellaneous goods , running a gold mine , project contracting , operating tour groups , and developing real estates , are put together , can you believe one person can do everything successfully ?
This may be an advantage of southern business people ??
Smooth and slick in all aspects .
At present , chain management , which has become the most important organizational form of domestic and foreign retail businesses , has a crucial role in circulation .
The largest retailer globally Wal - Mart has opened its 10,000 plus stores almost everywhere in the world .
KFC and McDonald 's are the same , in that their chains are world - class .
A company managed as a chain , due to its fairly clear scale advantage and a standardized operational model , which boosts the company 's risk - resistant capabilities and improves its degree of organization , develops at a stunning speed .
Thus , some people have shouted the slogan that they would become the " best retailer in Economic Zone on the West Coast of Taiwan Strait . "
Their name is New Hua Du -LRB- or " New Hua Du Supercenter Co. , Ltd " in full -RRB- .
Actually I know on such a holiday , children should have sent some delicacies to their parents .
In the past , when my paternal grandfather and grandmother were alive , my aunts would ask others to send something up here , and the elderly would usually feel the pride and happiness of being a parent at such a time .
Now I 've got my own small family , but I 've never thought about my parents at home .
Every time I think of them , it 's often a time when we are short of food at our own home .
I should be the one who feels guilty and upset , but it seems I 've never felt this way .
During the telephone call , mother also told me that my maternal grandmother was at her place .
In previous years , mother would prepare something and ask father to send to my maternal grandmother 's place .
My maternal grandmother lives about five li from us , but it 's a mountain path that winds around the mountains , an extremely hard walk .
Yet every time grandma actually comes on her own .
You should know grandma is already an old person of over 80 .
I was a bit unhappy with my mother , " why do n't go and get her . "
Mother said , " grandma is like a kid .
How can I get her when I have no idea when she wants to come ? "
People 's use of computers is changing from being focused on the PC desktop system to being focused on the web .
In other words , in the past we put everything into the computer .
Once the computer is lost , all the information will be lost as well .
However , in this new web-centric mode , such situations will no longer occur because all the services and applications are provided online --
No matter at what kind of terminal , people can access to all the information at any time via the Internet .
This mechanism works just like we deposit our money in a bank and swipe our cards to make purchases instead of carrying cash with us .
As described by Google CEO Schmidt , when computer networks form clusters , they can process huge data sets faster , and their speed to search answers or instructions will surpass that of any single computer in the world .
The absolute majority of hardware is not installed in the Google corporate park , but is distributed all over the world .
It may be running at high speed in a large data center near you .
The attraction of this mode lies in that : the load that a national electricity grid can undertake can never be matched with that of a power generator .
Collapsing in the great Wenchuan earthquake were not only buildings , but also a culture of agricultural civilization .
Agricultural civilization , characterized by an independent individual economy and a centralized polity of dependent groups , is an early stage in human civilization .
Transmission civilization has already begun , that is characterized by a closely cooperative and socially integrated economy , and a polity of individual independence , autonomy , and more choices -LRB- in other words , freedom -RRB- .
Industrial civilization is just an interim phase between these two civilizations .
The massive Wenchuan earthquake marked a complete end to the agricultural civilization .
In an agricultural civilization , people live close to the land , and roads are formed to link their homes .
As soon as a flood occurs , the homes and roads that have been built up over generations will be destroyed in an instant .
The earthquake blocks streams into lakes , and tens of thousands of people abandon their homes to escape the disaster .
In a transmission civilization , transport and telecommunications devices make life easier for people .
People can live where they want .
The unfertile , rugged regions of an agricultural civilization become scenic residences with all the conveniences .
If Nanjie Village had really issued shares , and then it would have been paying dividends on shares from 2004 onwards .
But the iron - clad fact is : none of the villagers or village cadres like Wang Hongbin got dividends .
The whole village continued to operate on its old system of 30 % given as wages based on how much you work , 70 % given as benefits based on need .
Old Yang , a villager , told us that at Spring Festival this year , everyone was given 7 jin of pork -LRB- the Hui people were given 10 jin of mutton -RRB- , 3 jin of fish , and a dozen or so goods like beef , oil , eggs and flour ; as well as 130 yuan of welfare vouchers per person -LRB- with which you can buy whatever goods you like in the supermarket -RRB- .
They are living a happy life with ample food and clothing and shared prosperity .
The vast majority of people support the communal ownership system , and do n't want to disband the collective economy and return to an individual operation system .
Results of the survey : 1. As of today , Nanjie Village has undergone absolutely no changes to its system and has done absolutely no privatization .
What Wang Hongbin and Lei Dequan say is true .
2. . Wang Hongbin , the " communist trail - blazer , " has not turned into a capitalist -LRB- he does n't have any shares , does n't have any savings , does n't have his own car , and does n't have a mansion ;
the villagers all live in new storied buildings set in a beautiful garden - like environment ; his family still live in a single - level building .
We 've seen it , the area is n't as nice as the garden district that the villagers live in -RRB- .
The radio station also provided a telephone number for complaints , instigating people daily to complain .
What do complaints mean ?
Are n't they words from Hong Kong and Taiwan ?
There are petition offices everywhere at our leaders ' location , and naturally there will be people designated to receive letters and visits of the average people in an extremely friendly and cordial manner .
There 's no need for a radio station to be such a nosy parker as to mind others ' business .
Actually I 've known for a long time that by their so - called accepting complaints , the radio station is intentionally collecting unfavorable and negative things for public release .
They do love a good panic .
There 's plenty of positive news in Nanjing , which I 've never seen =it report .
For example , Nanjing 's No. 2 and No. 3 bridges are magnificent and fast , but =it would rather focus on the traffic jam on the No. 1 Bridge .
The marina in Hexi is so wide and broad that even a plane can take off and land , let alone driving a car .
Instead of discussing such , =it would rather focus on those jammed junctions .
Nanjing leads the nation in various aspects .
Instead of publicizing such , =it would rather instigate average people to complain enthusiastically ....
Who does n't make a minor mistake ?
This is indeed finding quarrel in a straw .
Mr. Bo Yang , a famous scholar in Taiwan , passed away this morning at the age of 89 .
His tumultuous yet legendary life came to an end .
From now on , the Chinese literati will again have one fewer sage and warrior .
It was , of course , because of that book " The Ugly Chinaman " that I first learned about Bo Yang .
In the mid and late 80s of the last century , I was in middle school .
For some time , this book was suddenly in hot circulation in our class .
I found a copy very quickly and read it with great eagerness .
I was immediately attracted by Bo Yang 's vivid and pungent style , and sharp and unique opinion .
What impressed me most was the concept of " soy - vat culture " proposed in the book .
A remark that made people most angry was " one Chinaman is a dragon ; three Chinamen are a worm .
One Japanese is a worm , while three Japanese people are a dragon . "
I remember that at that time I even had a debate with my classmates over this in an attempt to prove that " three Chinamen are not a worm . "
It ended up in nothing conclusive .
It was not until later when I grew older and gained more life experience did I gradually come to understand and accept this statement .
I knew it may not be unbiased , yet it indeed hit the nail on the head by pointing out a major weakness in the character of Chinese people .
Haier regards transnational merger and acquisition as an important breakthrough point to realize its globalization .
On May 21 , a senior executive of the Haier Group -LRB- hereafter abbreviated as " Haier " -RRB- gave confirmation to our newspaper that the company has already had an explicit intention to restructure the home appliances business of the US 's General Electric -LRB- hereafter abbreviated as " GE " -RRB- and obtained an initial solution to capital .
So far , Haier has talked to the China Development Bank , with an initial financing plan determined , which draws on the pattern of Lenovo 's acquisition of IBM .
Overseas Expansion Opportunity On May 16 , GE confirmed it might sell or spin off its home appliances business , saying the business is overly concentrated in the United States .
With a total of 13,000 employs globally , GE 's home appliance department has been hardest hit by the stagnant housing market over the past couple of years , as it sells large quantities of dishwashers and refrigerators to home builders .
MattCollins , capital goods analyst at EdwardJones , said that with the weak dollar , the deal could be more attractive to an overseas company trying to get a foothold in the US market .
GE 's home appliances business , which generated USD $ 7.2 billion in revenue last year , is expected to sell for USD $ 4 billion to $ 8 billion .
The middle school he was at was Sangzao Middle School , Anxian , Sichuan .
It 's a junior middle school extremely well - known around Mianyang .
The school had the top middle school entrance exam results in the county for 13 years running , thanks to the high quality of teaching .
Parents in the surrounding region all scramble to send their children there .
The classes with the most students have over 80 students .
The students in the front row are sitting almost under the teacher 's chin .
When the earthquake struck , he was in Mianyang doing some official work .
As the earth was shaking , he could n't keep upright , and he and the dean of general affairs of the school had to cling onto each other .
He could n't get through on a cell phone , and the phone lines were cut .
After the first wave of shocks had passed , he immediately rushed in his car to the school , which was in a badly - hit area .
He drove the car at top speed , and he did n't say a word on the way .
He thought about the laboratory building at the school that had n't been inspected , and worried most that something had happened to that building .
In the mid 80s of the last century , when that building was built , the school had n't used a proper construction company .
It had been built in fits and starts over more than two years .
Later , no - one dared inspect the building .
When the new laboratory building was finished , neither the teachers nor students wanted to move into it .
They all knew what the quality of the construction was like when no - one dared inspect the building .
Near the Guanggu Square , a fruit stand merchant was getting ready to stop his vehicle and start selling .
In the distance , a urban management team member slowly walked over , and the stand merchant had no alternative but to drive away in his vehicle to avoid him .
He drove all the way around ; with no urban management officer in sight , he stopped again , only to see the figure of an urban management officer loom again ...
Such " hide and seek " without seething confrontation often ended up with those sidewalk squatting merchants " pleading for leniency and fleeing defeated . "
This method of law enforcement called " waltz " was gradually developed by Yuan Caishun along with his colleagues after he was transferred to the Guanshan squadron in 2006 .
It has now become the marvelous trick in civilized management .
Yuan Caishun has been working with the urban management for nineteen years .
He knows that once there should be a serious confrontation with ordinary people , there would be enormous social impact , jeopardizing the justification and effect of law enforcement .
He often says to his colleagues : Do n't be afraid of " exhausting your legs and lips . "
Mr. Cao , who is 60 years old this year , simply could n't withstand this " gentle offensive " of his and became the first " builder of illegal buildings to pay his own expenses of tearing down an illegal building " in the city .
In 2005 a safety accident took place in one of the factory buildings illegally constructed by Mr. Cao .
According to the regulations , not only should the factory building be torn down , but also the wages must be paid by the owner .
Mr. Cao was adamantly unwilling .
Untiringly , Yuan Caishun repeatedly visited him at home to persuade him .
This went on for half a month till Mr. Cao finally nodded and took out 4,000 yuan in cash to " foot the bill " for tearing down the factory building he himself constructed at the cost of hundreds of thousands yuan .
I suppose that petroleum hedge funds , having already brought down the US , are probably now looking for the next target .
Internationally , those hedge funds will not easily loosen their grip on petroleum growth stock , allowing the trillions of American dollars in our hands to buy even more oil .
Perhaps they will always keep the oil price high , until the point where China takes its hands off oil prices .
If this happens , the issue of when house prices will fall turns into an issue of when domestic oil prices are let loose .
If our oil prices fall into line with international ones , the outcome of this would be that domestic real estate prices dive . Because the high house price foundation that is derived on the basis of existing economic operating efficiency would be totally lost .
We could n't possibly see the other situation described by well - known national economists : the rise in oil prices drives house prices to go on advancing , because the rise in the price of raw materials causes widespread inflation to occur , and inflationary pressure then promotes house price escalation .
If that was the case , applying the same logic one would arrive at the conclusion that the stock market should skyrocket during a period of inflation .
And I have already posted 7 consecutive articles in this column concerning the reasoning behind " No bull markets with inflation " , so I wo n't linger further .
When I got up in the morning to listen to the radio , I was originally thinking of listening to major national affairs , such as meetings , reports , and activities attended by leaders .
I did n't expect to hear the curses against Nanjing the moment I turned on the radio .
In this city , traffic jams occur either in this place , or in that place .
Either the big bridge is congested , or Beijing West Road is jammed .
He had commented on all the places in Nanjing , condemning them all , without a single nice word .
Our beautiful Nanjing , the Nanjing with good urban planning , the Nanjing with advanced transportation , the Nanjing with towering buildings , the Nanjing as a modern metropolis , the Nanjing we love is described overall as a " congested city . "
I wondered how they knew it , could they be making it up ?
I did n't realize until later that they had installed remote cameras in multiple places to monitor numerous intersections and specifically selected the poor conditions to report on .
They kept chattering about how were such and such roads , such and such vehicles , and sometimes even took the hard - working traffic police to task for not making enough effort to direct .
They even revealed their police group number ; that simply amounted to direct attacks .
Older people getting remarried is a need in life , as well as a need psychologically .
Children 's attention and care for older people , or their emotion and behaviors , ca n't take the place of the emotional exchanges and behaviors between an old couple .
Marriage experts believe older people getting remarried on one hand can reduce the burden on children of both sides .
With two people supporting and caring for each other , children do n't have to get overly distracted and anxious .
On the other hand , by getting remarried , older people will have somebody to depend on at an older age .
They can support each other economically , care for each other in life , have somebody who respond to and understand their words , and comfort each other mentally , which is good for the wellbeing of older people .
In recent years , the phenomenon of older people getting married has gradually increased .
Most young people are in favor of their parents getting remarried , and are even active in being the matchmaker or go - between for the remarriage of their parents , which is a manifestation of social civilization .
Some young people oppose their old people getting remarried , while others are concerned that there may be inheritance disputes after their parents pass away .
They also pay out salary specially providing for a large gang of female duty officers , who watch the screens all day monitoring intersections , and not a few minutes go by without a negative report .
That female voice is pure misery .
I am No. xx duty officer , according to the screen at the moment , such and such an intersection is badly backed up with traffic .
Please , drivers out there who are able to do so , make an attempt to bypass .
It 's bad enough as it is churning out all these negative reports , but then commanding others to listen to your orders , are n't you being even more reactionary ?
And even that 's not enough ,
every day they work on pedestrians to ring in and report , such a place is blocked up again ; and then they interrogate them , what 's the reason for the jam , how long has it been jammed for , has there been an accident , are there any casualties , are there any ...... .
All in all , not a single nice thing to say .
Just in the end insincerely coming up with a couple of words of warning , drive well .
Is n't that crap ?
A perfectly good mood early in the morning totally ruined by you .
Misled by you into this state , how could I not get into an accident ?
Even more impressive , they use a few bad boys , one called Dong Sheng , one called Zhi Yong .
They are supposedly teachers .
Every day for hours on air , straight out insulting and abusing .
If you are abusing ordinary people , then that 's one thing , but it 's always abusing the authorities , some official is n't sympathetic , does n't accomplish anything , does n't do his job , basically it 's serious defamation .
High oil prices have destroyed the original operation mode of the U.S. economy .
As other sectors of the U.S. economy failed to cope with high oil prices by raising labor productivity , their investment returns dropped and capital expenditures declined .
Under the interaction of these two factors , housing prices plummeted and the subprime mortgage crisis exploded .
I am probably the first person in the country who proposed that the rise in oil prices had nothing to do with supply and demand nor did it have anything to do with the Middle East situations .
In early 2004 I already said in an interview with a weekly magazine : The hidden manipulator behind oils is the hedge fund .
Why was n't Europe impacted by high oil prices ?
The European Union has been carrying out its obligation to reduce carbon dioxide emission voluntarily for nearly ten years .
This has led to a constant adjustment of the economic activities in this region with a focus on emission reduction and energy conservation .
As a result , the economy of the European Union , restrained by the Kyoto Protocol , adjusted itself in advance to the challenge of high oil prices , and the overall economy has maintained a healthy operation .
Therefore , the euro can continue to rise during the period of rising oil prices .
Finally , one point that must be stressed is that the disaster rescue this time must mainly rely on mechanized rescue , which should be used especially for removing obstacles and clearing the road leading to Wenchuan .
Repeating again the rescue operation mode for the great Tangshan earthquake , which relied purely on manpower , will not yield good results .
Rescue dogs , detectors , and other professional tools also need to be urgently dispatched and shipped .
Rescue experts from the United States and Japan must also be invited for joint consultation as quickly as possible .
My hometown is in Sichuan , and my parents are still there .
Yesterday I made a phone call and learned they were safe , so I am a bit relieved .
But they said the quake this time was more serious than all the earthquakes before .
Nobody dared to keep staying indoors ; they were just scared of aftershocks .
This morning I called again .
Mom said there was another aftershock at 4:00 a.m. , and all the windows rattled .
Communications with Wenchuan and Lixian remain disconnected as of today , so no details of damages are known .
The surrounding areas such as Beichuan , Dujiangyan , and Hanyuan were severely hit by the earthquake disaster , with death toll already exceeding 8,000 .
Adding that of Wenchuan and Lixian , I estimate it will be between 50,000 and 100,000 , far surpassing that of the typhoon disaster in Myanmar .
The economic losses will surpass that of the nation - wide blizzard disaster at more than 100 billion at least .
Yesterday I called home again .
Mom said grandma had already gone back home .
I asked if she walked back alone again .
Mom said how could that be , of course she accompanied her home .
I was always curious what they , the mother and daughter , would talk about on the way back .
Could it be grandma talking about the happiness of having a full house of grandchildren or grandma feeling proud reminiscing her entire life of bringing up seven sons and daughters .
So mom must be listening quietly .
At this moment she was a daughter just like I am her son at this moment , also eager to listen quietly to her telling about the hardship in the past and the happiness in the future .
Mom said on the phone that she slipped by accident the day before yesterday and got a swollen bump like an egg on the head .
I was extremely worried and asked if mom felt any better , whether her head hurt , and whether she felt dizzy .
Mom said no , it was just a bit swollen still , nothing the matter .
All of a sudden , tears came to my eyes , and I suddenly felt mom had grown old .
This mom , who used to sound grumpy on the phone , has grown old .
Like a child , she listened to my advice and kept promising to be more careful .
When the earth is still unrest in the aftermath of the Great Wenchuan Earthquake that rocked China and shocked the world , the premier of the Chinese government has personally travelled to disaster - hit areas to organize disaster - rescue efforts , winning applause from Chinese worldwide and life - respecting international friends alike .
With the joint effort of people around the world , countless lives have been promptly saved and homeless victims have been initially placed .
People are faced with a further challenge of how to rebuild the homeland for several million people hit by the disaster .
After days of hard thinking , from countless cruel realities that we can not shun away from , we 've finally found a tiny path of hope .
Going forward along the thorny path , we suddenly see the daylight and a bright and broad road leading to the future . That is moving the capital to Chengdu to rebuild western Sichuan .
Moving the capital to Chengdu will help millions of people in the disaster - hit areas rebuild their homeland at an early time .
Rebuilding the homeland for millions of disaster victims , which has never happened and never to happen again , requires a powerful government to " step forward when giving directions " and organize and supervise rebuilding of western Sichuan by itself .
Moving the capital to Chengdu will help stabilize the emotions of people in disaster - hit areas .
The central government being able to share their weal and woe is the best emotional support and mental solace for people in the earthquake - hit area of Wenchuan .
Moving the capital to Chengdu will help provide strong scientific and political support to rebuilding the disaster - hit areas .
Both Nanjie villagers and cadres say there has n't been any restructuring .
Why did the Nandu Daily asserted repeatedly that " there 's solid evidence that Nanjie has restructured " and that Wang Hongbin has " privately turned the village enterprise into private ownership ' under his only name ? ' "
What kind of an iron whip have they got hold of as the weapon to attack Nanjie Village ?
Through our in - depth investigation , it turns out to be like this .
Henan issued a document in 2000 , requesting all enterprise companies across the province to demutualize .
Industrial and commercial authorities asked the Nanjie Village Corporation to register its demutualization .
The village cadres , who was adamant about public ownership -LRB- collective ownership -RRB- , thinking that demutualization was just privatization , did n't go through the formalities , because they did n't want to go back to the old road .
By 2004 , due to the pressure from various parties , with no loans from banks , a shortage of fluid funds and cash problems , the person in charge had no choice but to register demutualization in the name of a dozen some cadres in the village council .
Wang Hongbin 's 9 % shares they recorded were more nominal than real .
This is a forced makeshift in the special context of aligning with the market economy and the predominant trend of demutualization .
Following the registration , it is announced in the village that the equities are owned by all villagers .
Skilled talents can be trained .
Skills can be learned , which include a variety of skills , doctors , engineers , and electricians etc .
Creative talents can not be " trained . "
Young prodigy programs are an example .
Einstein was not " trained . "
Strictly speaking , someone who " trained " him was very disappointed in him and thought he would be a " no - achiever . "
Who " trained " Newton ???
This is true for great scientists , and even more so for great writers .
Cao Xueqin is the best pupil of which " professor " ???
This is true for China , and how about foreign countries ?
Shakespeare , I guess everyone knows .
But who can tell he is the product of which famous master ???
Besides scientists and writers , how about great entrepreneurs , Bill Gates , who " trained " him to develop the operating system ???
Ford , the first entrepreneur who realized automobile assembly lines , who is the immortal that gave rise to his great creative advantages ?
Many people are now disappointed in those past child prodigies who have now " become no different than average people , " making no " great achievements " people have expected !
They have no idea that not only ca n't their approach of " training " those years produce major talents , but people with real potentials would have already become withered under the destruction .
Eventually , it 's not bad to be an average person .
If they ca n't be average , they have to choose to be a monk .
-LRB- Sadly , do they have to attend a child prodigy =program to be a monk ? -RRB-
Let 's just not mention others below this level .
Although air dropping of tents is the top priority , such that the self - saving people in Wenchuan have a place to shelter from the rain , now it 's already 20 hours after the earthquake and images from the scene in Wenchuan have yet to feed to CCTV , which is quite a pity .
Given the capacity of the satellites , feeding could be done anytime .
It 's the same for surveillance aircraft , which have no communication problems .
There 's no need to keep this confidential , as the entire nation are wondering exactly how miserable things are Wenchuan !
Hiding information is not advisable even if the entire town has been buried alive !
Now areas not so seriously affected by the quake , such as Chengdu , Mianyang , Ya'an and Dujiangyan , are instead more easily accessible .
Conversely , Wenchuan and Li County , both hard hit by the disaster , where people are most jeopardized can not be accessed .
Therefore , parachuting and airlifting rescue must be carried out on a large scale , and reporters must be placed there as soon as possible , provided that spots of airlifting and parachuting are determined first by way of airborne surveillance !
It 's best that the seven military area commands and the Army Air Corps of the General Staff Headquarters are all dispatched and allocated properly in locations where rescue materials , medical personnel and engineering personnel are concentrated .
Civil aviation and air force transport aircraft are responsible for transporting large equipment and backup rescue troops .
Shuangliu Airport should also have a dedicated area for use by disaster - rescue aircrews .
Rush repair of facilities like railways , roads , communications , power and tap water pipelines should also be done in a prompt manner .
This is the " broken window theory " of economics , also known as the " broken window fallacy " .
This theory states that when a kid breaks a window , this necessarily leads to the person whose window it is replacing the window pane .
This puts the person who fits windows and the person who manufactures glass in work , and consequently creates employment opportunities and community prosperity .
And in accordance with the " multiplier theory " -- the window industry person earns some money , goes to buy a cola and brings the cola manufacturer an opportunity for business .
The cola dealer might then go to buy shoes .
Following this reasoning through , the wealth brought by the kid breaking a window will outweigh by far the losses involved .
Keynes in ' The General Theory of Employment , Interest and Money ' writes " If the Treasury stuffed all the bottles they used full with banknotes , put these bottles filled with banknotes down a disused mine , and then filled up the mine with city garbage , leaving it to private enterprise to dig up the notes based on principles of laissez - faire , then there would be no more unemployment problem , and with the help of the repercussions , society 's actual income and capital wealth would probably be much greater than now .......
Digging out the hole has got to be better than doing nothing . "
He went on to even suggest : " If our politicians ...... can not think of a better idea , then pyramid - building , earthquakes or even war may all serve to increase wealth . "
I thought of every way possible to borrow money , and due to the help of a lot of friends and relatives , I finally bought the house .
There were many stories in the process that I always remember with gratitude .
I do n't want to lay them out in great detail .
Just keeping them in my mind and being grateful for a lifetime will do .
After the house was bought it stood there for some months , and in the spring equinox of 2007 we started fitting it out .
That really was a time full of hard work and happiness .
Each time we would ride our electric bike from the countryside dozens of kilometers into the city , buying some things and then wearily taking the long road back again .
We rode under the burning sun , through wind and rain , heard the sound of croaking frogs by the roadside , and counted the bright stars above us .
On August 10 it was all over at last , and we moved into the house that belonged to us .
This process was mostly to the credit of my wife .
If it was n't for her decisiveness , this house may well not have belonged to us .
And now that house prices have risen a lot again , if it was now we would have even less of a chance of buying .
While during the whole decoration process , with her sitting on the back of my electric bike , even if her legs were numb , even if the wind blew and she was soaked by rain , she never had a single complaint .
And once we got back to the school , she still had to cook , wash clothes , tidy up that dorm room where we lived , that home .
And I would be sitting in front of the computer well before , writing all those useless articles , one after the other .
Just as a person 's name says something about the person , Chen 's " first pot of gold " came from the lumber business indicated in his name .
In 1982 , Chen got a ticket for a =train bound for Xiamen in exchange of his free labor .
This was the first time that he saw the world beyond the countryside .
It was also this experience that gave him the inspiration for making money .
He secured two truckloads of lumber on his own pretty good credit with the forest farm in the countryside and shipped them to Xiamen , making over 1,000 yuan .
From shipping by trucks to shipping by train , Chen made himself into the largest lumber supplier in Quanzhou by 1986 .
That year , he owned his first house in Xiamen .
However , unwilling to stay put , Chen Fashu mortgaged his house a year later and used it as collateral to purchase a motor tricycle .
Together with his two younger brothers , he hauled goods for a small store and bought the storefront soon afterwards .
Since then , Chen has been irrevocably committed to the business of department stores .
It was also from this small store of less than 10 square meters that the future powerful Xinhuadu Department Store took shape .
There are many many multifarious causes leading to the rise of a powerful country : institutional , cultural , and scientific .
I ca n't keep them clearly separate .
But there is one point .
It is always the new rising powers with larger population that replace the former powers with smaller population .
As it is from Portugal to Spain , Holland , then Britain and France , then Germany , Japan and Russia , and then the United States .
When , in one period , productivity develops to a certain level and productivity per person reaches an utmost , population , territory , and resources then play a decisive role .
Because anything can be learned , but population ca n't be learned and territory ca n't be learned .
Of course , population is not a sufficient condition , but it is definitely a necessary condition for becoming a powerful country .
Only when the conditions of other aspects have been all met does population then become a huge momentum and not a burden .
I dare not say that the next superpower to replace the US will be China , but I do dare say that if there is a country that can replace the US to become the new superpower , it definitely will be a country with a population larger than that of the US
One of the hypotheses states : a long time ago , in order to hide from wild beasts roaming on the land , humans had ever lived in shallow water regions for a long period of time , surviving on aquatic plants and fishes .
Therefore , the body hairs , which increased the friction in water , had fallen off .
The reason for this explanation is that the fine hairs on the back of humans run from one side of the shoulder toward the spine , a different direction from that of monkeys .
Only such a direction could reduce the friction in water , and provide more buoyancy for the person who is swimming in the water .
However , in all the primitive gathering settlements that have been discovered so far , we have not seen any settlement where people lived in such a way .
What is worse is -- from the perspective of the direction of the fine hairs as well -- the fine hairs on humans ' upper arm point downward , while the fine hairs on the lower arm point upward , which is to say , they all run toward the elbow .
This is somewhat similar to monkeys who have hairs : when it rains , they would hold their heads with their hands , and such a direction of their hairs would be easier for the rain to flow away along their elbows
In just nine short days , netizens have shown an unprecedented enthusiasm and concern for the proposal given by " Tian Nan Di Bei . "
As of 20:45 on November 23 , 15,417 people had clicked on this post , and netizens from all over were continually replying to the post to express their support .
" He really is a great farmer who is changing China , because he has solved the food problems of over a billion people so that we wo n't starve to death in the wilderness .
Even though he has n't been selected as an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences , and has n't won a Nobel Prize , none of this can disguise the holy brilliance that he personally possesses . "
Many netizens think that Yuan Longping 's repeated winning of major international awards shows international approval and praise for the great contribution in research and promotion aspects of hybrid rice made by those , represented by him , working in rice breeding in China over many years .
If he were to be honored with the Nobel Prize , that would be an even bigger incentive to those coming after him .
France and Rwanda have fallen out with each other .
They have expelled each others ' diplomats and closed their embassies .
Lastly , the government of Rwanda announced that it was cutting off diplomatic relations with France entirely .
The cause is said to be that a French judge issued an international warrant for the arrest of nine important members of the Rwandan government on the charge that they participated in the assassination of Rwanda 's former president twelve years before .
The Rwandan government has resolutely denied the charge , while the international community has likewise not come to any conclusion regarding the affair .
It is simply that the families of the French flight crew have brought the case to the court in France when the former president was killed and thus , that judge and the government want to hold their own law over the heads of others .
If you put aside whether the evidence is conclusive and look only at the obstacles from international law that the case will inevitably face , you will know that this French faux - pas against Rwanda on this occasion is extremely unwise .
The international media has found a few surprises during President Hu 's visits to the four nations of Vietnam , Laos , India and Pakistan :
Receiving " extraordinary - level reception " in Vietnam , according to most Vietnam media , were , Hu in the first and Bush in the second ; a break with diplomatic convention when both the general secretary and the chairman accompanied Hu during the troop review ; the meeting of Bush , Abe , Roh Moo - hyun and others with Hu was safely held in the hotel where Hu was staying , thereby making it resemble an audience with an emperor .
And this even resulted in the international media closely chasing Hu in his footsteps as he made this trip on his subsequent trips to Laos , India , and Pakistan .
Since China had already taken itself to this step , it would n't seem possible to not be in the international media headlines if it ever wishes not to .
For example , when China and India shook hands , it implied that 25 % of the people on Earth had reconciled .
What was there in the international news that was more attention - grabbing than that .
[] Many of the yaks in the Tibet region are raised in the wild .
[] Only when the Tibetans need money will they go into the mountains to catch a few to sell .
[] Yaks can be very curious about outside visitors .
[] In the time it took for us to get out of the vehicle and take a picture , the yak suddenly turned its head and started toward me .
[] It startled young Zhao , who screamed : Quick , get back in the car !
[] Without waiting for me to close the car door , he put the car in reverse gear and backed up a hundred or so meters in a single sitting .
[] We waited for the herd to leisurely cross the road , and climb a hillside before we continued to go on .
[] It 's true indeed , they are the landlords , and we were passers - by , so it was better to be polite .
[] The source of the Minjiang River !
We finally saw the source of the Minjiang River !
[] Like with all great rivers , it is those tiny brooks hidden in the damp earth of groves and thickets that converge into the torrential Minjiang River that has nurtured generations of children in the vast lands of Western Sichuan .
[] Leaving the Minjiang River , the car arrived at high mountains and sheer ridges .
[] Once again , mist again thickly covered the mountaintops .
The elevation at this time was more than 2000 meters .

[] Recently , the U.S. police could be said to be in the spotlight , and have repeatedly become the focus of media attention ; however , what put them in the spotlight was not their heroic acts or their extraordinary contributions in protecting the security of the people .
On the contrary , within the past week , there were successive incidents of police shooting civilians .

I think that sometimes it is not a bad thing to be ticketed by Uncle Policeman .
I remember reading a post by a fellow student , who said that he was in a very complicated frame of mind after seeing his parents taking off at the airport , and sped up to 120 miles on the highway while listening to Swan Lake .
I have never driven on the highway , but this should have been speeding , right .
I feel that he was extremely unlucky not to have encountered a police officer ,
Some things , some people are just this way .
He always finds you when there is nothing wrong , but disappears whenever he is needed .
In a word , this fellow student had the real bad luck not to have encountered a police officer .
In the end , he drove faster and faster until finally at 140 miles , he sped off the highway and plunged into the woods .
But fortunately , people 's luck always tends to balance out .
Although this fellow student did not encounter a police officer , at least he was not injured in the accident .
It was said that he would have fallen into a river had he left the highway a moment later .
So upon getting a ticket , just consider it the expense of averting a disaster .
Why do humans want to raise offspring ,
Some say this is human nature ,
This is voiced from the perspective of natural human instinct .
Yet from the perspective of human socialization , people in different historical periods saw things differently ,
For example , in China 's period of feudalist society , it was called " raising children to provide for old age , "
But when the retirement system in a society has gradually been established , this opinion no longer holds ,
Have n't some young people chosen so - called DINK families ?
Have n't some people chosen to be what they call single aristocrats ?
And on and on .
Raising a child is a great hassle ,
A mother has to go through various kinds of pregnancy - related discomfort during pregnancy ,
During delivery , it takes a lot of time and energy if it is a natural birth ,
Sometimes she might suffer a cut on her belly .
What are they doing this for .
Of course , according to the opinion of mainstream economists , these women can only be great fools .
" Zhu " means chopsticks .
Interestingly , the pronunciation of chopsticks " zhu " also means " stop , " which is very easy to understand , since we use chopsticks to pick up food .
It is just like Grandma Liu wanting to eat quail eggs .
-LRB- Grandma Liu picked up the chopsticks , only felt that she could not master it , so she said , " The chickens here are so handsome , they also lay such small eggs , which are pretty handsome .
Let me try one . "
This Grandma Liu was really straightforward yet humorous . -RRB-
But another pronunciation " kuai " for chopstick just has the meaning of " quick , " which is just opposite in meaning with " stop " .
It was said that boatmen felt that " stop " was unlucky , so they gave it an opposite name and called it accordingly .
There is a proper way of setting up and laying down chopsticks : they must be of the same length ; if the length is uneven , it has the meaning of really bad luck .
People often use the expression " three longs and two shorts " to symbolize unpredictable changes ; for instance , Sister Feng once said : " Just as there could be unpredicted winds and clouds in the sky , people too can experience misfortunes and fortunes at any time .
At this little age , if I have any long or short because of this illness , then my time on earth would be meaningless ! "
The story goes that in ancient times there were no nails to seal coffins firmly , so after the lid was placed on a coffin , three horizontal boards and two vertical boards would be used to tie the coffin up tightly .
The horizontal boards are long while the vertical ones are short .
Hence when the expression " three longs and two shorts " is mentioned , people are reminded of the sad event of somebody 's death , which would move people to tears , and they would put down their chopsticks , as they do not feel like eating .
For more than 100 days , more than thirty migrant workers at Binhai Park in the city of Haikou have been trying to collect their wages owed by the park , which is in arrears to them for sixteen months of wages totaling more than 400,000 yuan .
They have also lodged a complaint with the Haikou Municipal Labor Arbitration Committee .
However , the labor dispute hearing that was originally scheduled for October 17 has been pushed back repeatedly and up to this day there is still no actual date for the hearing .
-LRB- Monday , Nov. 27 , 2006 -- Workers Daily -- Wage Claim by Thirty - Nine Haikou Migrant Workers Meets with " Protracted War " -RRB-
When wage - claiming migrant workers encounter a " protracted war " , clearly , it is the greatest of injustices toward migrant workers .
Migrant workers are defending their own rights and interests through the legal process , but are being " reasonably but unfairly " postponed .
Just as a reporter said in his report , under the provisions of the Labor Law , the decision made by the Haikou Municipal Labor Arbitration Committee to postpone is reasonable ,
But this puts a problem before the migrant workers : among laborers , migrant workers are a vulnerable group because the income from their labor might only be sufficient for their living expenses .
If the time used for labor arbitration is too long , they will undoubtedly face huge pressure in getting through their lives .
I think the longer the arbitration of the migrant workers ' wage claim is drawn out , not only will it result in the migrant workers facing massive pressure in getting through their lives , but also have them face psychological pressure that can not be endured .
The wage claim by the migrant workers encountering a " protracted war " is in reality a protest against the Labor Law currently in effect .
Does a Labor Law under which it is " reasonable but unfair " to postpone times of arbitration need to be revised to be made more complete .
I had a very lonely childhood because I was the only child in the family , and most of my playmates in the neighborhood had moved to the cities .
Life , like that small river in front of my home , flowed quietly without the slightest ripple .
I often stayed on the riverbank by myself , watching the boats pass by .
They were all very small fishing boats , and under each canopy was a household .
I did not know where they came from or where they were going .
It seemed that I never saw the same boat pass by twice .
My mother sometimes asked : " Huazi , why do you go to the riverbank ? "
I said : " To watch the boats . "
I could not see either end of the river .
I started to think that this world must be very large , but that it does not belong to me .
I just stood on the riverbank watching .
The year when I was eight , we also moved to live on a street in the center of a small town .
Uncle Baocheng still lived a lone life by the river by himself .
I would still go visit him .
On New Year 's Day and other holidays , my parents would invite him over for meals .
In a flash , I was twelve and attending a local middle school that had a bad reputation .
Actually I graduated from elementary school with very good grades , but because my parents were not well connected , I was rejected by the best one , No. 1 Middle School .
I was somewhat despondent .
After they received the notice , my parents were very down .
I went out by myself and kept walking until dark .
I found I had come to the riverbank , and thought I might go and drop a visit to Uncle Baocheng .
At first , I signed up for a blog on DONEWS , thinking that it was a site for IT professionals where I could perhaps find friends more easily .
Later , I signed up for another one on MSN , feeling that writing on MSN might make it easier for me to communicate directly with my MSN pals .
But gradually , I discovered that both sites were not very good .
At that time , DONEWS did not have the function of tallying traffic statistics -LRB- I have the habit of looking at the statistics of everything -RRB- ; and even though MSN had that function , others needed to sign on to MSN before they could reply , this meant that after reading the entries , many could not reply even if they wanted to , hence largely reducing the interactive element .
The enthusiasm with writing the blog at the beginning was short - lived ; after writing a few original articles for promotion , I did not continue anymore .
At that time , I did n't think about posting articles from other sites as I felt that there was no need to post any articles if I could not come up with anything original ; this meant that sometimes for over two months I did n't even update a new entry .
Later , there were also some minor problems with both MSN and DONEWS , so I became more unwilling to post new articles .
So , these two blogs have not really been very popular , either
In a crucial period for the resumption of the Six - Party Talks on the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue , Japanese media revealed on December 3 that in exchange for Russia 's support at the Six - Party Talks , North Korea has given Russia exclusive import rights to its uranium ore .
According to US media reports , Japan 's Tokyo Shimbun quoted the words from an anonymous Russian official as saying that since 2002 Russia and North Korea had been in constant negotiations regarding Russia importing uranium ore from North Korean .
Russia , which has rich oil and gas resources , hoped to enrich the uranium into nuclear fuel and then export it to Vietnam and other countries , thereby becoming a major nuclear fuel export nation .
In exchange for Russia 's public support during the Six - Party Talks , North Korea has recently promised Russia exclusive uranium ore import rights .
The two sides will continue to negotiate .
The Russian embassy in Japan refused to make any comments on the report .
North Korea held its first nuclear test in October this year .
The UN then imposed sanctions , prohibiting member countries from engaging in trade related to weapons of mass destruction with North Korea .
Yasser Arafat -LRB- Yasser Arafat -RRB- was born in August 1929 in Jerusalem .
He was a Sunni Muslim .
When the first Middle East war broke out in 1948 , Arafat , who was only 19 years old , started to get involved in the fight against Israel .
In the 1950s in Kuwait , he secretly planned and founded the " Palestinian National Liberation Movement " -LRB- abbreviated to the " Fatah " -RRB- and " al - Asifa , " its military organization .
Arafat had been in exile abroad since the third Middle East war .
In February 1969 , Arafat began to serve as the chairman of the PLO Executive Committee and since 1971 had concurrently served as the commander - in - chief of the Palestinian Revolutionary Forces .
In November 1988 the Palestinian National Council passed the Declaration of Independence at its special 19th meeting , announcing the establishment of the State of Palestine .
On April 2 of the following year , Arafat was elected the president of the State of Palestine .
Since then , Arafat had appeared on the international political stage as a symbol of the Palestinian nation .
In 1991 , the Middle East peace process started , and the Arafat - led PLO carried out tough negotiations with Israel .
In September 1993 , Palestine and Israel signed the Declaration of Principles in Washington , thereby starting the political solution to the Palestine issue
According to a report by the Spanish newspaper Rebellion today , declassified documents from the US State Department confirmed that in 1964 the US encouraged and supported the Brazilian military to launch a military coup , overthrowing the constitutional president Goulart .
This was recently disclosed by Brazilian investigators .
Brazil 's Globo television reported that historian Fico from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro conducted this investigation .
He examined the documents released by the US diplomatic agency .
One of the documents entitled " A contingency plan for Brazil " was drafted with the help of the then US Ambassador in Brazil Gordon .
The US helped the opposing forces to deal with what they called " a communist revolution . "
The US State Department named that operation " Brother Sam . "
In letters sent to the White House , Gordon wrote that Goulart might be toppled and that this was for the sake of dealing with a so - called " a communist revolution " supported by Cuba or the Soviet Union .
Gordon described the forces opposing Goulart as " constructive forces " and it was they who had " convinced " the " president " to " hand over power . "
On March 31 , 1964 , President Goulart was overthrown by a military coup , and since then a military dictatorship regime had been established in Brazil , which witnessed five military presidents .
Goulart handed over power without resisting and died in 1976 during exile .
It was not until 1985 that the constitutional system was restored in Brazil and Sarney was elected as President .
At the end of November , relevant state authorities undersold temporary grain reserves twice consecutively in a seven day period in order to increase the supply in the raw grain market and meet enterprises ' demand for grain .
According to information in the website of the State Grain Administration , on November 25 , the National Development and Reform Commission and the State Grain Administration organized bid sales at the Anhui Grain Wholesale Trade Market and the Zhengzhou Grain Wholesale Market of 1.2 million tons of temporary wheat reserves that were purchased in 2006 at the lowest purchase price .
Deals were reached for 1.08 million tons .
On November 29 , they again organized a bid sale at Anhui Grain Wholesale Trade Market of 676.5 thousand tons of early indica rice that had been purchased in 2005 at the lowest purchase price .
Four hundred thousand tons were traded .
Entering into November , the prices of grain in some regions showed a recovery - type uptrend .
During an interview by the First Financial Daily yesterday , Marketing Department Manager Lin of the Xinliang Group , a grain and oil processing company in Henan , said that this year has been different from past years in that it has been influenced by market stabilization purchases .
The majority of the grain resources are concentrated in the state grain repositories while enterprise stocks are lacking .
" We are all waiting to bid on temporary grain reserves . "
According to sources , in Henan Province where the Xinliang Group is located , the first sale of temporary grain reserves only began last week .
It attracted multiple bids from grain and oil processing companies .
[] Just after we left Chengdu , it again began the pattering of small raindrops .
Very soon , we had arrived at Dujiang Weir .
[] I knew this area very well because I 'd been here many times before .
Originally I had planned to drive to the opening of the weir and take a couple of photos to record the scenic spot of this entire journey .
Unfortunately , the fog was even thicker by this time and there was simply no way to see the scenery , so there was nothing to do but to give up .
[] The car followed the west route of the Sichuan 's famous Jiu Huan Road going up against the Minjiang River .
[] Jiu Huan Road is one of the most important tourist main route in Sichuan .
It links most of the Sichuan 's scenic tourist spots , including Dujiang Weir , Siguniang Mountain , Mounigou , Huanglong , Jiuzhaigou , the Wanglang Nature Reserve on the East Loop Route , the Three Kingdoms Heritage Route on Mianyang , An County and Deyang , and as well as Sanxingdui and others .
[] At the same time , the Jiu Huan Route also links the villages in the mountain trenches of Western Sichuan , serving as an important lifeline for local economic development .
[] The Minjiang River followed us at the bottom of the valley , occasionally surging forward , occasionally meandering .
When comparing , you will find there is an extremely sharp contrast between the two countries of China and the US on the issue of tipping ,
Those who assuredly take tips in the US are precisely those who in China are not allowed to take tips .
In China , notices are posted in many restaurants , and even massage parlors , prohibiting attendants from accepting tips from customers ;
However , those who are allowed to take tips in China are precisely those who are not allowed to take tips in the US .
If doctors or journalists in the US are known by the others to have accepted " red envelopes , " they should plan to never work in these professions again for the rest of their lives .
In terms of the gap between the poor and the rich , it is much wider in China than in the US ,
A government employee in the US makes 50,000 US dollars a year , and working class people like waiters can also make 30,000 US dollars . Taxi drivers make even more .
Yet in China , a government employee makes 50,000 RMB , and a waiter can only make about 10,000 RMB .
As a comparison , why do n't people show care and consideration to government employees , doctors , teachers , and journalists in the US , and to attendants in China ,
I met with the mayor of Iowa City .
He is prohibited by statute from accepting gifts and hospitality valued at more than 2.99 US dollars ,
In other words , people ca n't even treat him to a cup of coffee ,
Do n't these people have to support their families and make a living ?
In addition to pointing out the commonly seen advantages of the Caucasians : steel , technologies , weapons , central and unified government , Desmond especially stressed one little - known factor -- bacteria .
He said that when the Caucasians conquered the new continent , the bacteria on their bodies killed far more Indians than their weapons .
In 1519 , six hundred Spaniards landed on Mexico to conquer the Aztec Empire with a population of a few millions .
They lost two thirds of their soldiers in the first clash .
What gave them the decisive advantage was smallpox .
In 1520 the Spaniard infected the opponent with smallpox , killing half of the people in the Aztec Empire including its emperor .
In 1618 Mexico 's twenty million people were reduced to 1.6 million due to the epidemic .
In the meantime , the Indians lacked a kind of bacteria to effectively attack the opponent party .
Desmond did not attribute bacteria to the human species , but believed that they , together with steel , guns and cannons , directly or indirectly originated from farming .
According to Mr. Liu , children who are bullied in schools is a possible reflection of the Japanese social norm of the strong bullying the weak ; in Japan , the Chinese are in a weaker position , so they are easily the target of bullies , and the same applies to children :
" Look , in Japan , a superior bullies his subordinates , a senior bullies a junior , and these simply are very normal cases ; therefore bullying others is something born and bred natively in Japan . "
Facing the issue of their children being bullied , Chinese parents have also raised different opinions .
Miss Hong , who lives in Bunkyo - ku district , said , " When children are bullied in school , parents should not dismiss it ; rather , they should immediately contact the teachers and other parents ' support groups so as to resolve the issue through communications ; at the same time , they have to clearly remember not to get into an argument , as this would be counter-productive .

Ms Lee , who already has three children , said , " Whether the children are easily bulled in school or not also depends on the social skills of the parents . "
Many Chinese parents themselves could not blend into Japanese society , and even try to avoid contact with other Japanese upon seeing them ; under such a situation , how could their children blend in ?
Parents themselves are mirrors of their children 's growth , so we ourselves have to step out and make friends , so that our children can voluntarily make friends with other Japanese children .
When they have friends , they wo n't be so easily bullied .
It has been almost ten years from the first time I got to know about Inter Milan from the newspaper , and then later I grew to like Inter Milan and to the time when I fell deeply in love with Inter Milan .
Actually , Inter Milan has n't achieved overly spectacular results in the last ten years .
Except a few prizes of little interest like a UEFA Cup , a few divisional cups and a few Super Cups , it has never once gotten a hand on a Champions Cup or a UEFA Champions League Cup .
These achievements simply are n't worth mentioning when compared with those of powerhouses such as Manchester United and Real Madrid .
Even within Italy , their records are quite far behind Juventus and AC .
Then why do I still like Inter Milan ?
Why is there only the blue and blacks in my heart ?
When I first came into contact with football , I appreciated it with a mindset of commiseration with the underdog .
Inter Milan 's just a step away from the championship for years and its long humiliation by Juventus and AC stirred a sense of sympathy in me ;
Secondly , I found Inter Milan 's blue and black jerseys look very comfortable to me visually .
Gradually , I was moved by the persistence of Inter Milan 's chairman Mr. Moratti .
Although the payoff has been small after decades of persistent investment , that does n't change his absolute sincerity toward Inter Milan .
As a result , I started to pay more attention to this soccer team
Rice washing water is said to be a very good natural beauty product .
Our grandmothers ' generation uses it to wash their hair and faces .
The head of our household also says that flowers watered with rice washing water grow exceptionally well .
With decreasing consumption of rice , our family has fewer chances of coming into contact with rice washing water .
When I was a kid , I felt it very fun watching the milk - like rice washing water flow out of the rice pot .
The snow - white and fragrant jasmine flowers that grew out of the nourishment of rice washing water are also no longer seen .
The first time when I cooked rice on a clay stove as a kid , I burned it into a potful of charcoal .
It also cost me a clay pot .
In spite of some of my subsequent remedies such as using a section of the white parts of scallions to expel the burnt smell , adding some water and white rice in an attempt to make it look better , I was still soundly scolded by my dear old mom .
Nowadays , life is becoming simpler , more refined , and more convenient , yet I always feel that something is missing .
[] Very soon it was noontime , and young Zhao parked his car in the rest area of the gas station ,
[] Next to it was a Pangpang Restaurant : " The food here 's not bad , we always come here for lunch .
I also know the boss well . "
[] I let young Zhao be our host and order some real farmhouse dishes .
[] But when the dishes came , I was knocked out .
[] Wild mushrooms fried with duck .
The taste was definitely out of the ordinary , the flavor of the wild mushrooms as it went into your mouth was unforgettable .
[] For the locally famous Lian Mountain double - cooked pork , this big chunk of it was enough to fill me up .
[] I like shredded pork in spicy sauce , and it was just a little too spicy .
[] Spicy duck blood .
Young Zhao said , this was made with fresh duck 's blood , not with duck blood powder .
[] Eh ?
There 's duck blood powder ?
[] It sounded very dangerous .
[] This fresh spicy duck blood had texture that was a little springy and very tender .
But it was just spicy , too spicy !
[] Besides these four dishes , there was a plate of green vegetables , plus a big tureen of soup .
[] " It 's too much , there 's only us two , how are we going to eat this ? " [] I asked young Zhao as I looked at him in surprise .
[] Several dishes , two bowls of rice and a tureen of soup all disappeared entirely after a few minutes of slurping !
[] Young Zhao is a typical Sichuan man .
He 's not tall , quite skinny , but surprisingly , he really can eat .
[] Okay , on this trip I am going to get some good food .
The food tastes best when you eat with a big eater .
First of all , state - owned enterprises sold old and obsolete equipment at low prices to some individual private enterprises -LRB- this was of course done through acquaintances in most cases -RRB- .
Given all aspects of " preferential treatment , " some early individuals engaging in transportation , spare parts refurbishment , and simple processing emerged as the first " wealthy households " in the 80s .
Enterprise reforms first started with small and medium - sized enterprises , and then the policy of " invigorating the large enterprises while relaxing control over the smaller ones " was implemented .
Then through preferential policies and methods such as " substitution of tax payment for profit delivery , " " appropriation instead of loan , " " using loans to exchange for stocks , " " contracting , " and " joint capital , " small and medium - sized enterprises were basically transformed into different modes of ownership such as " privately owned , " " joint venture , " or joint stock systems .
Now we have reached the stage of reforming and fortifying large state - owned enterprises .
During the process of economic restructuring , economic theories such as " marrying off the pretty girls first , " " popsicle theory , " " rotten apples theory , " " price theory , " and " social - wealth - is - tilted - toward - the - elites theory " all began to make their presence one after another ,
Among the various theories , what stood out was the word " sell . "
Dominated by the word " sell , " we sold factories , schools , hospitals , land , labor , resources , environment ..... .
In the series of selling off , state assets have been greatly diminished , and privileges and corrupt elements have left no stone unturned
What was Saddam prosecuted for ?
Earlier on , Iran 's involvement with the Euro - for - oil transactions turned out to be a big news item with negligible after - effects , and finally it became a non-issue , and hence there was no problem for Iran and the United States .
But this time , Putin came up with a Ruble - for - oil proposal , and even began intensive preparations .
Nobody would have any doubts about the technical capacity of Russia , not to mention its ability to protect its own resources and trade systems ,
The intimidation that Russia had inflicted on Ukraine is still remembered with a tinge of fear by some European brother - like countries .
The Ruble is allowed to float freely now , but everyone still has sufficient reasons to doubt the replacement of the US dollar in Dollar - for - oil .
But what was more vicious about Comrade Putin was that he had rolled out what is known as a " barbarous " gold system ; and that is , before the wide acceptance of the Ruble - for - oil , a portion of Russia 's annual oil revenues would be channeled toward increasing the country 's holdings of gold .
This is the first among all major countries to have issued such a clear proclamation - no wonder the recent link between gold and oil had almost been severed .
My wife job - hopped from a Chinese - funded bank to a foreign - funded bank ,
Either in terms of her experience or her ability , my wife is not my match , and most of the time I am her professional teacher .
Her only advantage is her foreign language .
After all , she is an English major graduate .
Now that she joined a foreign - funded bank , her position and salary are both higher than mine ,
Many times I would tease her , saying that they had chosen her , a seemingly qualified candidate , from a bunch of inferiors ...
My wife would answer : too bad my English is better than yours !?
I could n't argue with that , as English is my weakness .
I have gone for numerous recruitment interviews for the foreign - funded banks in the past few years , and also have had some contacts with foreign - funded banks .
My wife 's situation might have been a puzzle for many foreign - funded banks ' recruitment .
It is inevitable for foreign - funded banks to deploy a strategy of utilizing local talent .
Although there is a lot of recruiting information from foreign - funded banks on the Internet every day , as a matter of fact , the satisfactory candidates that they can find are very few .
Highly Original Large - Scale Backdrops in the NTD TV Evening Spectacular
After watching the New Year 's Spectacular held by NTD TV , I had a feeling that I have n't had for a long time ,
I used to feel bored of this kind of cultural gala already , especially the Spring Festival galas inside the country over the last few years .
The awkward way they are slapped together , the lowbrow joke - making and the complexity instilled into the content have caused me to lose interest in entertainment galas , while my body 's literary and art cells seem to be gradually dying off as well as my age advances .
However , I took in NTD TV 's Chinese New Year Spectacular as a friend had suggested and my literary and art cells sprung immediately and unexpectedly back to life .
None of the " a breath of fresh air " or that I was " in ecstasy " sayings can truly describe it .
In simple terms , I have vaguely felt a feeling of having returned home .
I do n't need to say anything about how brilliant the program was .
What most carried me away were , one after another , the large - scale stage backdrops with their unique content .
They gave viewers a completely new and unprecedented sensation ,
Here I 've only selected a few examples to share with everybody .
As for Mao Zedong being " forgotten even by the common people " , " scholars who study Chinese politics " will probably have to patiently wait for a period of time .
Furthermore that period of time might still be very long and I do n't think it 's something we can do anything about .
If we make the " symbol of a society 's progress " a country 's founding leaders being forgotten by their own citizens to the extent that they are " forgotten even by the common people " , then , first of all , I think the Americans would n't be able to do it ,
We can not imagine that the Americans , for the sake of " social progress " , would render Washington " forgotten even by the common people " .
America 's capital would have to change its name .
At least China does n't have a " Mao Zedong City " .
I think on the contrary that it 's not whether Mao Zedong has been " forgotten even by the common people " , but rather that certain people and certain powers are too anxious and too impatient .
Each time September 9 comes around , they unaccountably fix their gaze on the " trend " in " China 's official media " and then make a fuss over it ,
Does n't this illustrate perfectly that Mao Zedong can in no way be " forgotten even by the common people " ,
That 's because those people who fervently hope that Mao Zedong will be " forgotten even by the common people " are forever unable to let go themselves ,
Twenty - eight years after Mao Zedong died , some venerate him and some curse him ,
Regardless of whether it is voices of eulogy or words uttered in curse , it all shows that in the history of China Mao Zedong is a great man who can not be forgotten .
So what is this about being " forgotten even by the common people ? "
You mention that I always had a very big question about The Water Margin .
What 's so good about this book on earth that it is grouped as one of the four great classic novels .
There are excellent parts of the book , but as a novel , the makeup of characters is quite flawed .
For example , this Hu San Niang , with all her loved ones recklessly slaughtered by Li Kui , if she had any guts at all , she should have fought it out with that guy .
Yet she became sworn sister with her enemy and degraded herself by marrying a short ugly man .
What is the hell going on here .
This group of so - called heroes did some righteous deeds , but they did a lot of lousy things as well .
By mentioning that , it 's a lot like a novel about gangster lowlifes .
If a boy uses this book as inspiration , it seems he would have a great chance of going down the road of a criminal lowlife .
In terms of its historical themes , it diverges too much from real history .
Song Jiang 's uprising was not that awe - inspiring .
It seems it was quelled by royalist Zhang Shuye .
In my opinion , The Water Margin is simply not on par with the other three books .
Despite having not yet made his formal appearance in the Super League in Australia , Li Yan has already won praise from the New Zealand Knights club chairman .
Something else is also making Li Yan happy .
The elder sister of the international goalkeeper coach Jia Chunhua is currently helping out as Li Yan 's " nanny , " successfully solving the problem of Li Yan 's meals .
Jia Chunhua 's elder sister happens to live in Auckland , the arena where the Knights are based .
Even more of a coincidence , the house that the Knights club arranged for Li Yan is right across the street from Jia Chunhua 's elder sister 's home .
" I only have to go downstairs and walk across a street to get to Jia Chunhua 's elder sister 's home , " Li Yan said with a smile .
A few days ago when he had not yet found a place to live , Li Yan had been worried about his meals , but now the issue of meals has been smoothly resolved .
" The family of Jia Chunhua 's elder sister is taking special care of me , cooking my dinner every day .
After I finish my daily afternoon training , I go downstairs some time after 5:00 and walk across the street to pick up my dinner .
They are so kind to me that I even feel a bit uneasy ! "
The changes in our business model on this occasion are that we want to promote our commercial edition CRM System -- * Easy Client CRM * , and continue to retain and develop our open source CRM system -- C3CRM .
We 're certainly compelled to make this choice ,
Before we fully undertook C3CRM , we had always felt that we would be able to survive in China by offering technical support and services .
More than four months after we had established the company and officially gone into operation , we discovered that we thought wrong ,
Domestic enterprises are not all very willing to pay for services .
Even if we had some service - paying customers , they would pay for a while and then no more .
This was because they felt that they simply did not need our services and that by paying services fees every year they felt they would lose .
So it is currently very difficult to rely on collecting fees for services in China .
Chairman Pei of shopex feels the same way .
Previously , we wanted to collect fees for the vtiger Chinese language packs , but faced opposition from some friends .
In particular , those friends who had planned to use vtiger Chinese Edition to earn money or gain profit were strongly opposing and carried out a trashy commentary attack against C3CRM 's blog .
Some friends said that there was no notification at all prior to the translation and that they felt a bit cheated for collecting fees after the translation was done .
Later on , we were compelled by pressure to renew the free distribution of the Chinese language packs .
In the future , we will continue to provide everybody free vtiger CRM Chinese language packs and translation tools
On Thursday -LRB- November 23 -RRB- , a series of car bomb attacks took place in Sadr City near Iraq 's capital , Baghdad .
At least 138 people were killed , and more than 200 injured .
This was one of a series of explosions and it caused the highest single death toll in one day since U.S. military actions began in 2003 .
Iraqi officials said at least 138 people were killed ; but some reports noted that the death toll was over 140 .
Authorities have announced an indefinite curfew throughout Baghdad .
In the target Sadr City , which is on the east side of Baghdad , a total of three suicide car bomb attacks took place at 15 - minute intervals ; in addition , there were also sporadic artillery attacks .
The target of the attack was a crowded open - air market in Sadr City .
The first car bomb exploded at 3 p.m. local time , it was powerful , and was followed by two other car bombs .
The series of explosions had resulted in panic in Sadr City , which is on the east side of Baghdad , and the fire and smoke made many feel as if they were on a battlefield .
Sadr City is a gathering place for Shiite Muslims , and has frequently been attacked by Sunni Muslims .
In another attack , gunmen shot at the Iraqi Ministry of Health , and security forces returned fire .
The assassination of the Lebanese Minister of Industry has triggered off angry protests from supporters , plunging Lebanon into yet another precarious situation .
In merely two short years , this minister is the fifth senior official to be assassinated ; this shows that even after the forced withdrawal of Israeli troops , long - suffering Lebanon still has n't ushered in the peace that it hoped for yet .
The United States claimed that the Syrian government was the murderer , but Syria retorted by saying that the accusation was " totally without foundation , and in disregard of facts . "
At this moment , the real murderer is probably tittering , but the world has clearly seen that any one of the regimes of Lebanese and Iraqi is more fragile than the other .
The Western media said that in the " post-Bush " garbage era , countries like Iraq , Syria , and Lebanon will encounter a lot more good shows or terrible tragedies .
And the people believed that .
It is uncertain whether the Canadian Prime Minister had taken the political equivalent of Viagra , or had lost his mind due to political biases , but he " lost his temper " several times in China during APEC , and almost messed up his meeting with President Hu .
Fortunately President Hu was magnanimous enough not to take it to heart , and gave him the honor of a 15 - minute meeting .
However , when this fellow returned to his own country , he boasted recklessly by saying that his meeting with President Hu had " important historical significance , " and even exaggerated by claiming it as his " major diplomatic achievement . "
But those Canadian opponents already disgruntled with him , seeing through his tricks , could immediately tell that the meetings that President Hu had such as with Bush , Abe , and Putin all lasted over an hour ; a mere 15 - minute meeting with you -- excluding the pleasantries and translations -- was no different from an extended hand - shake .
In New Westminster , a homicide occurred yesterday in an apartment where many Chinese reside ,
A youth in his 20s was suspected to have been seriously attacked after he left a party ; he was found lying in one of the apartment units , and was pronounced dead upon arrival at the hospital .
After the event , two men were detained by the police to assist in the investigations , the motive of the murder remains unclear , and the case is now referred to the Provincial Integrated Homicide Investigation Team for further investigations .
According to the spokesman for the Provincial Integrated Homicide Investigation Team , Dale Carr , the crime scene was in an apartment unit on the 800 block of Agnes Street -LRB- Agnes St. -RRB- in New Westminster .
The police received an emergency 911 call at 12:20 a.m. yesterday , and rushed to the address mentioned above to investigate .
When the police arrived at the scene , they found an injured man lying in the unit ; he was seriously wounded , and certified dead upon arrival at the hospital .
The body was sent to the coroner for an autopsy in order to determine the cause of death .
For now , the police will not announce the name of the victim ; it will be decided upon only after the family is notified .
As to the cause of the victim 's death , and whether the case is linked to any illegal activities and others and etc. , the police declined comment .
Carr also said that the police had applied for a search warrant from the court yesterday morning , and entered the unit in the afternoon with the warrant for a detailed investigation , in order to understand more about the incident .
Investigators from the Identification Bureau also went to collect information from the scene later ,
As to the motive of the attack , and whether the police had found the weapon , the police have declined disclosure .
In the face of criticism and nitpicking , I believe that Jesus is weaker than Darwin .
Why ?
Because Darwin was allowed to make mistakes , since he was a human being ; but Jesus was not allowed to make mistakes , since he had been described as God .
Darwin proposed Evolution Theory , but it was just a theory , and he himself also admitted that there were many questions ,
Others may agree with him , or they may accept some parts while disagreeing with other parts , or in the future we might discover that the general direction of Darwin 's evolution is largely correct though filled with a lot of errors , and that there might be an improved version of evolution which is more accurate and comprehensive than what Darwin had proposed .
But as the originator , Darwin deserves much credit .
Jesus is God , and the Bible is the word of God .
God creates everything , understands everything , predicts the future , and is infinitely resourceful , so how can he be wrong !
Therefore , if you find a sentence that is allegedly said by God , but effectively turns out to be wrong , then this god will be overthrown .
Therefore , Jesus is more vulnerable to criticism than Darwin , because once an error is found , then he could not be the true god .
After entering into the WTO , we frequently see that the viewpoint of reporters when criticizing domestic banks is : When the foreign - funded banks arrive later on , if your service attitude does n't improve a bit , I will take my money and deposit it in a foreign - funded bank .
Then we 'll see what these state - owned banks do !
Furthermore , we frequently see theoretical articles saying that the arrival of foreign - funded banks will lead to domestic banks suffering a massive loss of trained personnel because of the wage and benefit issue .
Of course , there are many areas in which I am also dissatisfied naturally with the service of domestic banks .
Regarding salaries at the domestic banks , I also know a thing or two .
But using foreign - funded banks to scare people has absolutely no meaning with regard to solving the problem .
The first thing that has to be clarified is that foreign - funded banks do not act selflessly and go out of their way to help others .
They have a threshold .
Judging from the present , they only serve the wealthy portion of the population , so the majority of those who are enthusiastically waiting in anticipation will probably be disappointed .
So you feel that the line to deposit money in a domestic bank is long and you want to transfer to a foreign - funded bank ?
Without several hundred thousand or a million , even if you want to become somebody else 's client , they wo n't want you .
As for the outflow of trained personnel , most employees of domestic banks have been stirred into an frenzy by the media and can hardly sit still as they wait for the day they will be enlisted .
However , it 's being said that these people want to train their own employees and the first to be hired will be fresh university graduates .
The people who have worked in domestic banks so long will not be in the ranks of those welcomed unless they are extremely specific high - level personnel with customer resources .
Yes !
Mao Zedong led the Chinese people through decades of bloodshed and hard struggle .
Long ago , his life was proven to be all for world peace , all for the people having peaceful and happy lives .
The leader of eight hundred million people devoted his entire precious life to the people of the proletarian class , and gave his eldest son Mao Anying 's life to the people of China 's proletarian class and the motherland .
Chairman Mao was in charge of all the power that governed China .
From beginning to end , all the power to control everything was obtained for the people and used for the people .
In addition , history and facts from the past and the present , from home and abroad , also attest that only his voice in his late years could shake China , and could shake the world .
Yet , in terms of substance , what did he eat ? What kinds of things did he use ?
There was braised pork in soy sauce ; there were heavily patched pajamas , and this radio that martyr Mao Anying often used during his lifetime ...
In sum , nothing can be found that was different from what ordinary people possessed .
Grandma came in the morning .
Qingqing got up and put on clothes by himself , and then went to the kindergarten with Grandma ,
He still had Cola Cao Juan Juan Xin for breakfast and left after finishing eating ,
He left quite early today ; Grandma said she wanted to see Qingqing do physical exercise today .
He did not want to eat dinner in the evening ,
Grandpa said he ate only half a yam ,
There was still yam in Qingqing 's bowl ,
In the end , the yam was eaten , but the rice was left over .
Grandma said Qingqing practiced the keyboard right after he came home today and played very well .
He is already very good at playing " Three Mice . "
Back then Sister Yaoyao was so frustrated by this tune too that she cried out of desperation .
Qingqing played the keyboard and pulled Dad over : " I want to play it for Dad to hear . "
By the side , Dad listened to Qingqing playing ,
Grandma also came over to listen to Qingqing play , and also counted the beat ,
Qingqing sat on the mat with his back very straight .
Grandma said this was better for Qingqing 's health .
Qingqing also practiced very seriously .
Grandma said we should not give Qingqing things to eat at night and must care for Qingqing 's teeth ,
Grandma said to Qingqing : " If your Dad gives you things to eat again at night , I will not allow your Dad to take you home . "
Qingqing said no and wanted to go home ,
Mom said : " How about Grandma stays in our home , is that okay ? "
Qingqing did not agree : " That 's my home .
Grandma has her own home .
Why does she have to come to our home ? "
Grandma said : " Your Dad is my son .
Why could n't I stay in your home , ah ? "
Qingqing thought for a moment : " Grandma , let me tell you , there are five beds in our home .
You can sleep here . "
That 's a quick change

Chinanews.com , Nov. 23
According to a report by Japan - based Chinese Review Weekly , from November 15 - 25 , Dalian City of China is holding the " Week of Dalian " featuring a variety of rich and colorful activities in Tokyo , Nagoya , Osaka , Kyoto , Kanazawa , Maizuru , Toyama , Gunma , and other places of Japan .
This has further expanded Dalian 's influence and publicity in Japan , attracting the attention of Japanese news media and people from all sectors and kicking off a new round of " Dalian Fever " in Japan .
The head of the leadership team for this " Week of Dalian " event in Japan is Dalian Mayor Xia Deren , who arrived in Tokyo on November 15 , leading the Dalian Municipal delegation .
The Dalian Municipal delegation consists of the government group , the economics group , the culture group , the education group , the sports group , the overseas talent recruiters group , the media group , and the comprehensive group , among others .
During the " Week of Dalian " in Japan , fourteen events of fairly large scale were planned , such as the Presentation and Consultation on the Dayaowan Bonded Port Area , the Promotional Fair on Dalian 's Key Industrial Park Areas , the Japan - China Economic Forum , the IT Products Presentation , and various exchange activities .
On November 19 , Dalian Mayor Xia Deren met with Chinese Ambassador to Japan Wang Yi in Tokyo .
Xia Deren briefed Ambassador Wang Yi on the main content of this " Week of Dalian " event and on the friendly exchange activities they had carried out with some Japanese cities during the several days since they arrived in Japan
A spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Jiang Yu stated at a routine news conference on the 16th that a report in The Washington Times about " a Chinese submarine tailing the USS Kitty Hawk aircraft carrier battle group " was not factually true .
The Chinese government very " skillfully " displayed a " cunning " ability to respond diplomatically .
During the entire incident , the Chinese military did not say a word from start to finish .
On the other hand , the government first denied it , then later played it down .
It was absolutely an attitude of " broaching a topic with a delicate touch " , in particular the phrase " the report was not factually true " .
How very " cunning ! "
If the report contained just one point that was not factual , then " the report was not factually true " would be correct .
It sounds like it negates everything , but in fact it does n't negate anything at all !
This world is really " intriguing ! "
A large man holding a machine gun from a distance runs to a doorway of the home of a small man , then sees that the small man is holding a vegetable knife with which he is about to slice vegetables .
Subsequently , it is that small man who is " threatening " the " security " of the large man ?!
How " democratic " this world really is !
Whoever has strength has the " right of speech ! "
So the Chinese government has to be a little " cunning . "
If China has twenty of the world 's most advanced aircraft carriers and one of them encountered some ship or another outside New York Harbor , I 'm afraid that it would be the others who were threatening our security .
That is the reality of this world .
In almost every sociology textbook , there is always a chapter entitled " Socialization " .
" Socialization " is a core concept in sociology .
Its meaning is a process in which people obtain their characters and take on behavioral patterns .
Animal behavior is primarily inborn .
Human behavior on the other hand is primarily acquired after birth .
In other words , a newborn baby is still an animal and only becomes a person after undergoing " socialization " .
Socialization primarily occurs during a person 's growth development period .
Of course , after a person reaches adulthood , he or she still has to undergo " resocialization " .
If you follow the logic of sociologists forward , you will feel that it is closely reasoned and well argued .
But there is one point that they do n't explain -- why is it that the acquired learning portion of animal behavior is small ?
Which of the physical characteristics in which humans differ from animals result in the smooth process of acquired learning ?
Why have the vast majority of human individuals not rejected " socialization " ?
These are important questions , but they can not be explained by sociologists .
A song that just could n't be any older .
Back in the days when band combinations were popular in Hong Kong , there was a band called blue jeans .
I 've heard some of their songs , and I do n't like them much , for example , that very famous song , " How Can It Be This Way . "
I , as a person , do n't have much ambition , so when I listen to music , the best is purely to get away from reality , stuff like Utopia , the Garden of Eden , fantasy or sweet nothings is just fine .
I definitely do n't want any critiques on modern society 's wrong practices .
So , even though I love Tat Ming Pair , their " Ten Young Firefighters , " ah , and " In No Particular Order , " ah , all of which are n't my taste .
But then one day I heard the song " Rainy Day , " and could n't believe that this was a Blue Jeans song where they lay down arms and turn romantic .
This feeling is like BLUR 's " TO THE END " or the Rolling Stones ' " AS TERAS GOES BY . "
They say a strong man who can show his emotions is a special treasure .
Even if it 's not manly , it 's impossible to forget .
You do n't have to have a broken heart to go and listen to " Rainy day . "
There 'll always be more of a market for sad songs ; they have more power to hurt .
It 's a hoarse voice very much like Lu Guanting 's , it 's very deep
I have n't written about soccer for a long time .
If I still do n't write anything , I will feel even sorry for myself .
I do n't think you can ever get all the people in a team together .
First Cambiasso was injured .
Now he 's back , yet Cruz has gone for treatment .
And do n't even start on Boba ; he 's always injured .
It would even be strange if he was not injured .
But it 's OK , as there 's a back - up for every person 's position , and the back - ups are all pretty strong .
Now if Inter Milan formed a second team of a lineup , it would be also very strong indeed .
Tonight they 're playing Lisbon , and I expect I will get up and watch the game .
Since I went to school I have n't watched much soccer , and now my soccer cravings have kicked in again .
I 've seen a lot of matches this season , but I only watched up to the match where they lost to Bayern .
I believe they wo n't run into that kind of thing again tonight .
The reason they lost to Lisbon in the first leg was actually still that Inter Milan were too arrogant .
They did n't give much thought to the strength of their opponents ,
But tonight it 's different , they 've lost before , they are n't allowed to lose again in this match ,
More importantly , if they can just win this match then they can go through early .
I do n't think Mancini will have failed to understand the importance of this match .
In the club they take this match very seriously .
They think it 's as important as the fight for the lead over the weekend
Everyone knows North Korea is poor .
Every year China assists with such a great amount of grain , crude oil , and so many light industrial products .
From this we can see the degree to which agriculture and basic industries in this country have been reduced .
But for North Korean athletes , although every one of them looks very skinny , their energy is no less than that of our athletes , who are provided with three scientifically formulated meals a day .
A women 's soccer match is now being broadcasted live .
Looking at the speed and fight of the North Korean girls , I basically already know the outcome of this match .
Of course the soccer ball is round , and anything is possible , but to be able to excel under such repression is almost an impossible mission .
I have been thinking about what makes North Korean athletes so full of energy ,
Though each of them looks sallow , when in a real fight , let alone China , they are even no less strong -LRB- physically -RRB- than the European teams .
It suddenly occurred to me that North Korea is rich in Korean ginseng .
There is n't enough rice , but they can mix it with ginseng for food .
Although your stomach may be not satisfied with it , the energy your body gets is surely not something three meals of braised pork in brown sauce can compare .
[] A high school teacher teaching chemistry in the United Kingdom has appealed to the Department of Education to allow the views and theories that God created everything and intellectual life created the world to be introduced into school to be taught to students together along with Darwin 's theory of evolution , which has been dominating the scientific community since the 19th century , and let students judge between right and wrong for themselves .
[] The long - standing policy of British Department of Education has been that the theories such as God 's creation are " unsuitable " for primary and secondary education .
[] Critics have pointed out that some scholars from non-English countries actually have long mistranslated evolution theory and misinterpreted Darwin 's original intent , and the translation itself has a natural development from low to high level , a falsehood with almost religious bearings .
[] Also some Western scholars - such as paleontologists and archaeologists from the United Kingdom , France , and Germany in the 19th and 20th centuries - have long made use of the distorted theory of evolution and social Darwinism derived from the argument to attempt to prove their point that certain races are more advanced than others .
Limbering up after training is very important !
Today team members and I played a one - against - two exercise of offensive and defensive technique .
I led Chen Long/Zhou Wenlong in practice .
Since I became a coach , I have had little time to take on the court and play a match with team members because once the coaches step onto the court , the other team members will stop to watch us play and wo n't carry out their training duties very well .
I have n't stepped onto a court for a long time and I thought I might not be able to play a full fifty minutes .
Once I started playing , I played fine , hey , and my speed was still pretty good , so when I led them in play together the atmosphere was really good .
I played for fifty minutes in one sitting .
Afterwards when I rested a bit I felt a bit tired and my body also reacted with a lot of aching pain .
But I really enjoyed myself !
After training , you have to remember to limber up !
It is really important .
If you do n't do a good job in limberring up , it will affect your training in the next day !
Power is produced by the contraction of muscle .
After vigorous exercise , muscles will also become excessively tired .
So if you want them to recover , you have to make them regain their elasticity .
We have to help them by putting pressure on the ligaments and make muscles that have contracted too much following vigorous exercise regain their elasticity by stretching them .
This is what we call limbering up .
If you do n't allow your muscles to loosen up and recover each time after training , eventually you will get an injury .
In the past , China 's wealth was entirely state assets or collective assets .
It all belonged to the ordinary people .
In other words , when the " elite " first began to clamor for " reform " , wealth was in the hands of the ordinary people and " reform " was in the hands of the " elite . "
After reforms here and reforms there , the outcome was that wealth had fled into the hands of the " elite " and the foreigners .
The ordinary people were left only with " reform " , while the " elite " who constituted less than 10 % of China held more than 90 % of the wealth .
No matter how the " elite " sugarcoated it , the fact was still a fact .
First - hand experience is more authoritative than any smooth talk .
As long as an ordinary Chinese 's IQ is not the same as that of the house dogs of the jet set , they can not possibly remained indifferent when faced with such reality .
If the " elite " want the ordinary people to have no opinion or bitterness over this , depriving the ordinary people of their " right of speech " would be useless , using " entitlement theory " to deprive the ordinary people of their right to thought would be useless , and " revealing the dagger at the end " by using politics , violence and suppression would be even more useless .
Reckoning all the options , it seems that the only thing to do is to eliminate the ordinary people 's ability to perceive , causing the ordinary people to have absolutely no consciousness of any of the suffering .
This might have solved the problem -- of course , this is the elite 's " most ideal " solution .
As long as this day dream is n't realized , ordinary people will inevitably have their own assessment of all the facts , and it is unlikely that the " reforms " of the " elite " wo n't have a stink about them in the minds of ordinary people .
It was n't that anybody had used language to give reform a " stink " , but that the " elite " had used action themselves to make themselves " stink " and make their " reform " stink .
With unprecedented fervor , all the people of China 's ethnic groups plunged with boundless enthusiasm into the high tide of the construction of socialism !
It gave rise to the years of burning passions .
There emerged a large group of working - class advanced role models in the fashion of Wang Jinxi the Iron Man .
" I would rather live twenty years less if it meant that I could bring in the Daqing Oilfield " is the most representative heroic statement of that era .
The " Lei Feng Spirit " of taking pleasure in helping people was exalted throughout society .
Advanced achievements in " innovation " and " abandoning private interests to achieve public good " came one after the other without an end .
Although the economy was not prosperous during that era , both internationally and domestically we prevailed over difficulties that were difficult to imagine .
The people were not distressed by economic backwardness , but rather were full of confidence in the ideal of building a new life .
They had ample spiritual sustenance to keep them full .
" At night you do n't close the door and on the road you do n't appropriate lost property " ; " Human relations stretched to all corners of the land " , " Hearts link to each other even when they are a world apart for the public good " and " strict enforcement of order and bans " best described the society in that era .
[] Chairman Wu Bangguo of the NPC Standing Committee arrived in Hong Kong on the 2nd to attend the opening ceremony of the Telecom World Expo , and with that , starting his trip of the three - day visit .
[] He first engaged himself in the event of getting close to ordinary people , chatting casually with students and residents .
[] However , contrary to what the outsiders have expected , this time Wu Bangguo did not make any special effort to support Donald Tsang when the elections of the Election Committee and the SAR Chief Executive are approaching , but only stressing his confidence in the future of Hong Kong and hoping that all sectors will get united , exercise tolerance , and properly deal with the existing social conflicts and differences .
[] Happy to See Changes in Hong Kong On the 3rd , Wu Bangguo attended the opening ceremony and the cocktail reception of the Telecom World Expo .
In the evening he will attend the home banquet held by SAR Chief Executive Donald Tsang in his honor at the Government House .

Tmac 's problem is actually very simple , that is : do n't be selfish , be motivated .
Yesterday KB shot 26 times , and he 's just had a knee surgery this summer .
Is he really not worried about getting injured again ?
That is being unselfish , and that is being motivated .
Tmac gets the highest salary in the team , so he should n't care too much about himself .
If he 's like what he is doing right now -- neither willing to break through at the risk of being injured , nor willing to take the responsibility of the last shot on his own shoulders like a real leader of the team -- then we get the Tmac we 've got now , and we might hate what 's happened to him , but we 're angry that he 's not fighting back .
That 35 - second flash of brilliance just proves that he has the ability to create miracles .
A real great star wants to keep on creating miracles , keep on breaking records , and keep on pushing the limits
Looking back at 2006 , it can be found that when choosing collaboration partners in Chinese market , more and more multinational corporations turned to Baidu .
Last month it was eBay , and before that , there was content provider MTV ; IT hardware manufacturer Hewlett - Packard , IBM , and mobile phone manufacturer Nokia .
Microsoft 's choice of Baidu this time has yet again strengthened Baidu 's brand name .
Over the past one year , Baidu 's brand name has established a polarization , where the strong becomes even stronger .
Therefore , brand names have become an insurmountable barrier for pursuers .
Multinational corporations ' choice of Baidu was based on the selections of Baidu made by the Chinese market as well as Chinese netizens .
According to the latest survey data released by iResearch , Baidu 's market share has reached 69 % , while the market share of its major competitor Google has slipped to about 19 % in China .
Recently , Google has raised doubts about the survey data .
It is very possible that Google is worried about being marginalized .
Today , Singapore 's Zaobao.com reporter Yu Zeyuan filed a report from Beijing -- " Chinese Official Media Silent on 28th Anniversary of Mao Zedong 's Death " ,
The first characteristic seized by this fellow was that " yesterday was the 28th anniversary of the death of Mao Zedong , the founder of Communist China , but in official Chinese media , including television , newspapers , and websites , there were hardly any reports commemorating Mao .
Many people had already forgotten or did not even know the death anniversary and birthday of this first - generation Chinese communist leader .
After the collapse of Saddam Hussein 's dictatorial regime , Iraqi religious forces had entered a period of revitalization and expansion ,
Although the distribution system of the new legislative power in Iraq had generally taken care of the interests of all parties , and found a relatively reasonable balance point among all ethnic groups and sects -- otherwise a management committee , the interim constitution , and the current interim government would not have been successfully generated -- this does not mean that there were no contradictions among them .
From an internal point of view , Shiites and Kurds tend to see eye to eye on the political and economic benefits , and Iraqi politics had almost become the arena of these two factions ,
Although under the balance of interests some of Sunni political figures were involved in politics , what the Sunni radical groups were most concerned about was that the Shiites would turn around and suppress them in the future .
In February of this year , a radical Sunni organization attacked the Ali Mosque , which is the religious shrine of Shiite Muslims , and this led to the eruption of the conflict between Iraq 's two largest parties .

[] However , three people , Li Ao , Clara Chou and Ke Tsi - hai , who had low support of the poll , were not invited to participate .
[] On another television program , Li Ao bitterly criticized the Public Television Service for being unfair .
He also pulled out already prepared lawsuit pleadings , saying that he had decided to sue PTS for attempting to prevent him from being elected .
[] On a program on TVBS broadcasted at the same time as the debate was going on , Li Ao said that his lawsuit pleadings against PTS had already been written .

Following the government 's announcement of new immigration regulations , all travelers arriving in New Zealand will receive the same treatment as they would receive when going to the US .
When they enter the country , they will be asked to provide biometric information .
At a press conference this afternoon , new immigration law confirmed by Immigration Minister David Cunliffe will give immigration officials the power to collect , store and use biometric information of non-New Zealand citizens .
These so - called non-New Zealand citizens include people with a tourist , temporary or residency visa .
These new regulations are very similar to procedures for entering the US .
The new immigration law also permits the immigration service to provide " limited " biometric information on New Zealand citizens to neighboring countries .
However , the law does not explain the reason .
Cunliffe said , it has presently not been decided when or how the biometric information will be collected from people 's bodies .
The government has introduced legislation that will permit further collection of DNA samples from people 's bodies .
The new regulation on biometric information is only one article among the sixty - one articles that make up the new regulations .
Cunliffe said the new regulations will effectively simplify border - entry procedures and protect citizens ' right and international human rights .
Although lacking enough evidence to show who poisoned Alexander Litvinenko , a former Russian spy still under emergency treatment in a London hospital , it is no surprise that everyone immediately suspected the Russian government and President Putin .
Litvinenko betrayed Russia , had many enemies there , and had records of violating Russia 's relevant judicial laws and human rights .
Many people in the West had believed that this poor former Russian special agent would probably get assassinated .
The Kremlin immediately defended itself ; this was also no surprise at all .
A Kremlin spokesperson announced that any assumption about Russian government 's involvement in this poisoning incident was fantastic talk without any evidence ,
A foreign intelligence agency spokesperson said that the Soviet Union and the Russian Intelligence Agency have never carried out any assassination activity since 1959 .
Who believes it ?
Russia has always disregarded human rights .
The response of the Russian government to any human rights related issues is always disappointing .
How really nice it would be if Putin 's people would say something like the following words : Ah , this is really vicious .
We will surely assist in finding out who is the murderer !
How really nice it would be if Putin said some similar words after investigating the assassination of journalist Anna Politkovskaya behind her own home door .
These journalists , politicians , and business people , they only committed the " crime " of reforming Russia , yet they were assassinated .
Two hundred and fifteen innocents were killed in Baghdad , with their limbs flown everywhere and flesh all over the bloody ground .
This results in the biggest death toll since the deposing of Saddam .
The Sunni and Shiite factions have quickly competed to blame each other , making this shocking massacre , which no one will admit , seem even more horrific .
Bush , who ca n't even protect himself , has long given up his cowboy act .
Before Thanksgiving he released turkeys according to tradition , yet untraditionally , he admitted that " the Iraq war is now like the Vietnam war . "
I do n't know what the Iraqi authorities , who are struggling hard to survive , are going to think .
Perhaps the summit that Iran , Iraq and Syria are planning is their move to seek for self - salvation .
But one of the participants of the summit is unexpectedly none other than the mortal enemy of the US .
As Iraq does n't evade it , and the US can not block it , this is enough to show that those 215 wronged spirits have actually found peace .
There came the news of an explosion at Moscow University .
No one was hurt , but it was a serious psychological blow .
Moscow University is a symbol of Russia .
Its position is even higher than that of Harvard in the US .
If people 's evil conduct even befalls such hallowed ground , then the hurt it causes to the people 's heart and even the president can be easily imagined .
Putin was already feeling down and upset .
The West insists that that defected spy who died in exile in London was eliminated on Putin 's orders .
They 've gone on to call Putin " a cold war schemer . "
The handsome and cool - styled Putin has become furious , with the Russian government issuing a very strongly worded denial as well .
But the all too credible " last words of the spy , " together with Putin 's own background in espionage , have still managed to put a scowl on the face of this modern popular leader at the Russia - EU summit .
Prior to Darwin , there were two schools of ecological thought : harmony theory and conflict theory .
Darwin was the consolidator .
If we take a comprehensive look at Darwin 's thought today , he has not been seen , as we initially thought , to merely inherit the conflict thought of which Malthus is the representative .
Darwin , at the same time , also inherits the thought of harmony .
In his early years , Darwin was an admirer of Linne .
After reading Linne 's works , Darwin formulated the following type of view regarding the natural world : that nature is a complex network and is replete with harmony and interdependence .
For example , can a species of plant depend on itself to survive ?
It is impossible .
When it blooms , it needs help from bees to disseminate pollen for it .
When it bears fruit , it needs birds to transfer its fruit elsewhere .
Only in this way can this species of plant propagate and spread its own future generations to all the corners of the Earth .
So he proposed that the nature was a complex network and that its members were interdependent .
This was the first stage in his research and his entire theory .
We ought to acknowledge that within the limits of a specific time , one can find things of positive significance in many events in the history .
But take note , these things of positive significance are restricted by the premise of specific time .
Extending these positive significances beyond that premise is totally meaningless .
So that is why my sense of uncertainty has arisen .
I clearly understand that the so - called " positive " significances referred to in The River Elegy only exist in a puerile fashion in that special period of time .
So why to the contrary has this kind of puerile thing again unexpectedly become our survey pole and flag in a mature era far from that period ?
If it is not nonsense or for some ulterior motive , then we probably have to say that society really has significantly regressed .
Does such a grown - up really keep turning back as he lives on ?
Regarding this as fine , but perhaps a different explanation is that society has not regressed , but just that there are some people who have not progressed ,
As for them , that 's the way it is , and that was their zenith ,
Once that period was past , basically they became the same as those about to be buried , and they are getting worse day by day .
More than half of the UEFA Champions League games have already taken place , and basically many strong teams are guaranteed access to the elimination series .
Although the focus of this round is on the match between Basa and Chelsea , there is little doubt that they would jointly enter the quarter - finals .
But the situation is very complicated in Group B ; if Bayern does its best and judging by their abilities , they should entirely demolish the Sporting Lisbon .
Internazionale Milan has lost the previous two matches to the opponents , but now they have finally began to explode ; it remains to be seen if such an explosion would be too late .
On the 4th day of the matches , Internazionale Milan would be in freezing - cold Moscow ; Spartak is the only team that uses artificial turf , and it will be a great test for the Internazionale Milan .
Inter Milan is without its four key players , Cambiasso , Recoba , Adriano , and Vieira .
With the absence of these four players , it is estimated that Internazionale Milan might be significantly affected .
If they can not score three points in this match , their mission of acquiring the championship basically comes to an end .
There are some other games where the outcomes are fairly certain from my point of view .
Both the English Super and Italy 's Serie A have their advantages to some extent ; but Italy 's Serie A play two games within a week , and this would put their physical abilities to the test .
Especially for the Internazionale Milan , who exerted tremendous effort in trying to win the big game against AC Milan in the Derby war ; now they must be mentally and physically exhausted after they arrived in Moscow
The company that I previously worked at in Beijing encouraged employees to take the test for their drivers ' licenses .
The result was that the companies had a pile of drivers who possessed drivers ' licenses but did not know how to drive because , although having passed the driver 's test , they had too little actual experience on the road and were afraid of driving .
I did n't take a road test in the US either so I 'm not clear how it 's actually done .
But in these last couple of days I have read articles about road tests posted by other people and I sensed that the test in the United States was primarily to test for safety awareness ,
Americans probably feel that there 's not much to test for technical driving skills since most cars are automatic vehicles , and who would not be able to learn it , on the other hand , it is safety awareness that is the standard for detecting whether a driver will threaten his own life or the life of anybody else .
A friend once told me that his classmate who had three years of driving experience in mainland China had to take the road test seven times before he finally passed it in the US .
I think that after driving for three years the classmate was surely able to drive a car very well , but the problem was precisely that he drove too well , he had a hard time adapting from no rules to rules .
I think the high requirements placed in mainland China on the driver 's technical skills are due to the large number of people who do not observe regulations .
On the road , it is very normal to see people suddenly dart out , so good technical skills are indispensable .
In the small cities here , there are few people along the big avenues , so there 's no need to be too worried about such things
[] I left Chengdu with great excitement , accompanied by Xiao Zhao , my friend 's driver .
[] Xiao Zhao is a Chengdu local resident , and has often driven visitors to Jiuzhai and Huanglong to tour on an average of over ten trips a year ; hence he is very familiar with the routes and the environment .
[] The total distance between Chengdu and Jiuzhai is over 400 km , and it takes six to seven hours .
To get there within a day would be too rushed and exhausting , and the body might not adjust well to the area 's high altitude while touring Jiuzhai the next day .
[] If the trip is divided into two days , not only would it be much safer , there would also be more time to make brief stopovers at tourist spots and ancient towns along the way .
[] In Xiao Zhao 's words , the process is also very important , ah ?
[] Even though I wanted to reunite with my parents , who had already arrived in Jiuzhai ealier , I still accepted Xiao 's careful arrangement with pleasure .
[] According to the plan , the first day 's route was from Dujianyan to Wenchuan , and we stayed overnight in Maoxian .
[] We continued to forge ahead the next day , passing through Diexi Haizi , Mao'ergai , Songpan , and finally arrived at Jiuzhaigou and Huanglong scenic areas .
The more than 6,000 workers that this group used to have were all bought out .
Only some 700 people work at the reorganized Cinda Changlin Group .
The rest of them have all scattered in limbo as they search for a way to make a living .
Since January 2005 , they themselves have had to renew insurances by themselves .
For the costs of retirement and health insurances at current levels , each person has to pay about 3,000 yuan per year .
Where can they go to get the money ?
This month Jiangxi Province increased pension payments to the retirees , but all the indispensable living costs that a person needs to pay for have started to rise accordingly in the markets .
The government 's " average wage " level is going to rise again , so next year the costs of retirement and health insurances that laid - off workers have to pay for will rise again .
Even for those laid - off workers who can find work , are private companies going to give them higher wages ?
And how are those who can not find jobs going to make a living ?
Has the government thought about this ?
If there are problems in the future , who will then be the one breaking the " law " ?
These days , overseas study has become popular .
To friends and relatives , it 's a proud thing to be mentioned .
Children of the rich and government officials , who does n't want to enhance their status through overseas study ?
Let alone that getting oneself a western diploma will make getting a good job easier in the future .
Even old dad and mom making a parade of it everywhere would look exceedingly good !
However , those in middle class families or even laid - off workers see those children of the wealthy and powerful go overseas , come back cloaked in glory and all have a good future -LRB- they do n't know that family wealth and good backgrounds of those are the only real guarantees -RRB- .
How wonderful !
Thereupon , they pinch and scrape to send their child overseas ,
It seems that once they are sent overseas , nothing but a wonderful future and unlimited glory will return .
Nowadays , it is more often the case that those who do n't pass the university entrance exam and are wasting their days at home without doing anything are sent overseas .
With a bit of " toughening up " , everything will be okay .
Wrong !
With a huge chunk of cash spent , the frightening thing is that the payoff falls far short of expectations .
Even more frightening is that it holds the child back .
I 've been in France for several years !
What I have experienced myself or , even more , what I have seen are the countless who have given up their studies year by year , those with wrecked health everywhere , those who sold their souls and even those who lost their lives .
Overseas study is a splendid term , but in return it demands youth , effort and staunch perseverance , as well as sufficient rationality .
Life is never a bed of roses in any location , even more in a foreign land where there is a language barrier , different customs and no family or friends .
Most inferior mammals have short life cycles , small heads , simple social behaviors , short gestation periods and large litters of offspring that are underdeveloped at birth .
Most superior mammals , however , have long life cycles , large heads , complicated social behaviors , long gestation periods , and small litters of well developed offspring that already possess a certain level of capability .
Mankind is a perplexing exception .
His life cycle is not the longest but still very long .
He has the largest head , the most complicated social behavior , and the fewest offspring per pregnancy .
But the offspring are underdeveloped when born and they have the longest growth period after being born , actually taking 17 to 18 years .
Elephants are developmentally mature within eleven years of their birth .
Their time spent in the womb actually takes up to twenty - two months .
The gestation period of humans is only a few days longer than that of chimpanzees , but " it is only six months after birth that the human brain reaches the percentage that a chimpanzee reaches at birth . "
" Compared with other primates , we mature and develop at a snail 's pace . "
Compared to the speed of development , the human gestation period is clearly too short .
Biologists estimate that if the human gestation period were proportional to the growth period , the baby would still have to spend another seven months to one year in the womb
Paqueta wants to finish Saad Al - Harthi -LRB- the butcher -RRB- in soccer and educationally .
Night Star
6 x 1 = 6
Paqueta
Away from the club colors and loyalties .. and striving for a explanation and clarification . So far I have not found a convincing explanation for two incidents involving one player , the star Saad Al - Harthi .
The first is the matter of his call up to the national team after he clearly excelled at his club , then being put aside by Mr. Paqueta , outside the formation , even on the benches in the stadium .
He did not play even as a reserve , nor was he unshackled and returned to complete his university studies of which less than two months are left .
Acquiring an education remains the most important , and is the weapon that covers the professional player , especially as Al - Harthi had postponed it more than once , all during his participation in the Saudi national team ...!
So read on with me .
Article Six , clause three of the Professional Regulations stipulates .. that the professional player undertakes to continue his education and raise his cultural level
and what supports the need to look into Al - Harthi 's return is that Mr. Paqueta already has six strikers beside Al - Harthi and all of them took part in the last two games ...!
The second incident is the report raised by al - Masibih to His Highness the President of the Union about Al - Harthi 's diligence and his readiness to represent the homeland , which raises a wider question mark about why this report concerned Al - Harthi alone ?
Has anything happened in the past that would contradict it ?
The answer from all the fans is , of course , no ..!
Or is there someone who ordered that this report be submitted ..?
What are his motives ..?
I know for sure that someone will summarize everything I referred to above place it in the category of preferences .
And then I will not , will not care , as long as I want to transmit a fact that we are in great need of players who are skilled with their brains and their legs .
So liberate the minds of those with skilled legs so that we would enjoy a generation blessed with a civilization of progress and consciousness and awareness
Let us all repeat together with our hearts before our tongues " Long live the Green , long may it live "
From under the door --
His last title that stuck to him and which he retained is " FIFA international expert "
So what will he win from the title " the Legend of the Gulf " apart from proving the saying " not getting tired of titles " after the overwhelming public popularity ?
What a sad media that which reduced the meeting of our national team with Qatar to the confrontation of Al - Shlhoub with Khalfan ..!*
The invisible reason behind Jasim 's decisive victory in getting the " Legend of the Gulf " title is his insistence on thanking the eight media personalities who voted for him !*
A question occurs to me .
How come a player for whom voted 55 % of an awesome number of the public does not get the title , while a player with 45 % is given the title on the basis of no more than eight media personalities voting for him ?
How ?
Since the " one and only " media started criticizing the coach Paqueta heavily .. can we innocently ask here whether this media has become a " middleman " striving for Paqueta 's dismissal and his return to their team ..?
What supports it is the delay in their team contracting a coach ..!
I found the novel -LRB- The Searcher and the Searched For -RRB- clearly in the tyrannical individualism of Al - Shlhoub and al - Qahtani .. and each of them searching for the other ..!
The emblem of the leadership did not suite him -LRB- neither in form mor in content -RRB- *
Paqueta puts his earpiece in his ear and talks on the telephone throughout the match *
This can only have two explanations .
The first is the presence of a technical manager in the stands , -LRB- he was n't there -RRB- ...!
The second is the presence of another person dictating to him while he executes ..!!.

A Very Ordinary Native Country
Night Star , here is an advice for free : do not try and tire yourself with Khaled Al - Shaalan .
The man suffers from unnatural fanaticism and the problem is that there are those who support him .
If you scrutinized all his articles and his appearance on the channels and his transfer from one channel to another then you would know this man 's disease .
Encouragement is a nice thing .
However fanaticism , the turning of facts on their head , the schadenfreude , the mockery and the lying and innumerable , uncountable issues are present in this sick person ;.

The Saudi system acts arbitrarily away from the law
Asaad
I did not read the article .

The annual report of the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights in the Arabian Peninsula :
6/01/2007
London - Al - Quds Al - 'Arabi " from Ahmed Al - masri :
In the opinion of the annual report issued by the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights in the Arabian Peninsula what facilitates the the Saudi system 's abuses of human rights is the set of governmental administrative regulations that are not based on justice and equality , and which are a part of the state structure that is far removed from legal accountability , be it to independent international organizations or local civil groups .
This is what makes the system act arbitrarily .
The 2006 report on human rights abuses in the Arabian Peninsula prepared by the committee , criticized the Kingdom 's lack of a constitution regulating the course of the country , stating that the Saudi regime missed a fundamental element on which any political system is based .
This element is the constitution which regulates the course of the country and the rights of the ruler and the ruled at various levels .
Thus far , there is no written constitution for the country .
It added that Saudi laws are not written down and are obscure , and despite the fact that the government 's basic law deals with some of the main legal issues , nevertheless it is not a constitution .
The report also criticized the Kingdom 's legal system , pointing out that the Supreme Judicial Council appoints judges , posts them and dismisses them , and that the Ministry of Justice also holds judges accountable .
It deemed that the judges are not independent and are subject to pressures from senior members of the ruling family and from senior government officials to influence their decisions .
Also , the members of the public and members of the royal family are not actually equal before the judicial system .
In its opinion the government has continued to commit serious violations .
The restrictions imposed on the media and the internet have also continued , as well as the repression of minorities , especially of the Shia and the Ismailis .
The government has continued to ignore the wish of the people for a responsible government which can be held accountable and questioned .
It accused the Kingdom of using the law as a repressive political weapon or tool against the society at a time when the aim of the law is to protect the individual 's human rights from the power of the state .
In its opinion , the Saudi criminal justice system facilitates detainees being exposed to harm during the period they are in custody and under investigation , the reason for this being the lack of judicial supervision .
What makes the abuses increasingly grave is that the main arresting authorities , these being the public security forces , the public investigation forces and the religious police , do not fall under any judicial supervision .
The report stressed that one of the most important loopholes in the basic governing system is its failure to recognize the right to the freedom of expression and belief , and pointed out that the Saudi government does not allow political parties and puts stringent restrictions on the freedom of expression .
It brought to attention the fact that the number of citizens banned from traveling abroad for political reasons has exceeded 14 thousand .
It added that reports estimate an approximate 6 thousand Shiite citizens from the Eastern Region , Medina and Najran are banned from leaving the country .
Passports are being confiscated without a court order and there are many reasons for confiscation - from traveling to Iran to other unknown reasons .
The report indicated that the basic governance system does not recognize the right to peaceful assembly , considering that the Saudi regime puts all kinds of difficulties in the way of the religious , cultural and educational activities of the Shiites in the Kingdom .
The report accused the Saudi regime of banning Shiites from job opportunities in administration of public schools , adding that the government bans teaching any religious books in schools and universities that are not Hanabali and does not present any Shafii , Maliki or Shiite opinions as part of religious instruction .
It does not allow non-Hanabali clerics to teach their doctorines .
It pointed out that the government controls religious education and the public and private schools from basic through to the end of the university stages , where all the religious and history books are in accordance with the interpretation of the official doctorine .
It does not include any views of the other Sunni sects and the Shiites in the textbooks .

Asaad , why do you specialize in copying everything that is against Saudi Arabia ?
Is this its reward for supporting the Palestinian people ?
Do you want her to rule with positivist law instead of God 's book ?
These people will not be satisfied with us until we follow their denomination .
God have mercy on him whose faults have distracted him from seeing the faults of others .
God grant success to all .
The Rejoicer
I wish that you were more logical , my dear brother ...
You downloaded the subject without reading as you mentioned , just because it is against Saudi Arabia .
I do not declare Saudi Arabia free from wrong - doing ; it has faults like others and we wish they would be eradicated .
But it is not good , my dear brother , if these are your positions , especially as you post good articles about the Palestinian issue and Hamas ...
By doing this and quoting the buzzing of the Rafida and others causes the fair reader to react to the issues that you bring up and the subjects which you raise , and this reflects negatively on the subjects of beloved Palestine and Hamas ..
By doing this you are transmitting an aversion , which you might not feel ; and aversion between all the Saudis and Hamas and Palestine .
The word is integrity .
Asaad
Upon you be peace and the mercy of God .
I download everything I find before me about Saudi Arabia in the Al - Quds Al - Arabi newspaper which is blocked on the Saudi internet , because the overwhelming majority of the readers of the forum are Saudi and they have the right to read .
So far the number of those who read this article has exceeded 1600 people .
You must not get upset about the copying of these articles , because you have the right to read those who praise you and those who curse you .
My position on Saudi Arabia is well - known , I have written praising it for its position towards the Palestinian people and their prime minister a number of times .
Sultan al - Hakr
Asaad : you specialize in defending the Rafida in Lebanon and other places .
Look at the evidence from your article , " as well as the repression of the Shia and the Ismaili minorities , "
" It added that reports estimate an approximate 6 thousand Shiite citizens from the Eastern Region , Medina and Najran are banned from leaving the country .
Passports are being confiscated without a court order and there are many reasons for confiscation - from traveling to Iran to other unknown reasons . "
" The report indicated that the basic governance system does not recognize the right to peaceful assembly , considering that the Saudi regime puts all kinds of difficulties in the way of the religious , cultural and educational activities of the Shiites in the Kingdom . "
This is also one of your articles which you copied to defame those you call Wahabis
http://alsaha.fares.net/sahat?128@91.sd1NcTEBAaa.32@.3ba99db5 .
Asaad : The Shia must submit to the constitution of the state in which they live and our constitution is Islam .
To write to me : http://sultan5.arabform.com
The one taking refuge in God
I have been following your writings for a while , Asaad ..
And whenever I wanted to write a reply , I change my mind ..
I want to know why most of your contributions are about Saudi Arabia only ?
As regards what you said about the reason for your copying of this news in your reply no. 3. Saudis and others can access this newspaper .. this is not a main and convincing reason .
I thank my brother , the Rejoicer , for his reply , he wrote what was on my mind .
-LRB- Fear God wherever you may be -RRB- .
It is very easy for us to use Islam , but it is very difficult for us to serve Islam .

So according to you , you have opened us a window for fresh air ?
Brother Asaad , Atwan 's newspaper is contaminated so be careful against continually passing on the anthrax disease , The jar wo n't survive each drop . Even if you were its correspondent and distributor , and of the articles of the mercenary Ahmed Al - Masri specifically .
It is also a nest of the haters from amongst the collaborators and the Khwarij who are being directed by hostile parties who do not want anything good for this country and its people .
We continually ask : what does London , the instigator of the Balfour Declaration , benefit from hosting to Atwan ?
What are his supernatural abilities that enable him to spend on his wretched newspaper , the circulation of which does not cover the cost of the ink !? Together with the costs of his accommodation , insurance , children and car .
It would be nice if you supplied us with a fiery article by Atwan against Tony Blair 's statements on Iraq , which say that the war there is a sectarian war .
Man .. the likes of him who live in a country that gave away his homeland to the Jews ; this is the lowest degree of expressing loathing .
Our Lord ! Give us mercy from Thy presence , and shape for us right conduct in our plight ..
Hissa al - Aoun says today what men have not said in an article , and there is nothing more important than it in Saudi Arabia .
Natiq Khayr
Hissa Abd al - Rahman al - Aoun
Accountability of ministries or accountability of companies ?
Hissa Abd al - Rahman al - Aoun
From time to time , lots of conferences take place calling for accountability of companies .
The target of this accountability is joint - stock companies including real estate companies , industrial companies , and others , many of which took the last dime in the pockets of people who yearned for wealth and wanted to expel the ghost of poverty from their lives .
They are many .
We find an excuse for some of them .
It has been said that necessity is the mother of invention .
But I say necessity is the mother of carelessness .
Of course , I find no excuse for these companies .
I will mention some of them which formulated all their studies in a way to enable them to milk money out of small investors and the poor and widows and orphans through advisory offices which master with perfection feasibility studies with negative action .
This is what leads us to be sure that everything has negative aspects just as it has positive aspects , like medicines which cure a disease but while doing so cause another disease , and similar repercussions which sometimes lead to destruction .
-LRB- anyway . -RRB-
But why not make conferences also similar to those first by targeting -LRB- government ministries -RRB- in particular .
The state , may God protect it , and at its head our wise leadership which has spared no effort to serve the Saudi in all aspects of his life , the last being this year 's budget which , thank God and his beneficence , surpassed all our expectations .
This is the eagerness of the father of all , the good king , to make us happy .
Before , it was last year 's budget which was also a happy surprise .
And before that , dozens of annual budgets which were prepared for the development of the country and the citizen .
Consequently , we do not see this budget spent as we would like and look forward to , but rather as recommended by the leadership in how to spend it .
Back to this year 's budget , which surpassed all bets , and was appropriate for a country like ours .
This is what leads me to demand monitoring of these ministries whose safes have suffered indigestion from the budgets that end all the lean years and halt all the series of excuses which we hear from some that all the required development projects , which in turn will make the country and the citizen happy , lacked liquidity , and other excuses , such as the public debt and other acceptable and unacceptable excuses .
This year there is no excuse for anyone , especially Abu Matab -LRB- may God protect him -RRB- , who was harsh with the ministers and demanded work and accomplishment from them after offering to each minister what he needed .
Because we are still in the first months , it became a duty to monitor this ministry by many authorities , not only the Surveillance Authority .
Rather , this budget requires the creation of a ministry concerned with monitoring and surveillance , and consequently holding accountable .
Let its creation happen with the new cabinet formation in particular , so it enjoys a commitment of transparency and accountability .
How nice it would be if the strategy of this surveillance authority were centered around the following question : where will this be spent after programming the spending mechanisms and reviewing plans and programs and projects for which this major budget was allocated ?
And how nice it would be if its disbursement were scheduled according to the duration of projects and the method of their implementation provided that at the end of each year it presents an estimated budget for the coming year along with a review of what was spent from the previous budget , which of course will not be spent all in one year , because some major projects can not be completed in one year and need several years so we can see it in the land of reality .
Through this mechanism no ministry will be allowed to ask annually for an increase in its budget if it does n't submit a report showing where and how of the money was spent .
If the projects are not completed during the year , then let the current budget , or the remaining part of it , be carried forward , until these projects for which this large budget was allocated are completed .
And let some of the tasks of this ministry which we hope will be established be monitoring all this and taking severely to task any ministry that hoards one budget after another while releasing a lot of news about which we do not see any reality on the ground , as our wise government and our citizens wanted .
We are all -LRB- in concern a country -RRB- , and despite differences in our inclinations and desires , we all love and are concerned about this homeland .
The Saudi family under the leadership of our wise government has every right to monitor , hold to account , and control the implementation of projects .
National responsibility demands that we workers in the three types of mass media -- watched , listened to , and read -- demand that the leadership have a suitable entourage , and they follow up all cases of deficiency and dereliction and forcefully point them out so that the negligent people will not be negligent and the sloppy people will not be sloppy .
In that way we will monitor all the groundbreaking achievements which these ministries also make , and shed light on them while presenting positive media support .
With such monitoring and care , we serve the country and its treasures , first among which is the Saudi people .
Through this , we serve the interests of the country and its government , which this year released the largest budget in more than 30 years ,
This is clear evidence that our not being drained financially and not suffering human losses in various wars has provided our country with a budget like this one which will be spent on the redevelopment of the country and its sons in all aspects of life .
Although the masters -- the residents of the White House -- monitored our budget and had hopes for it -- the evidence for that is Rice 's visit , who stopped in the Middle East after a recommendation by Tom Lantos , Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the U. S. House of Representatives , who set up an accountability session for her and the Republican team working with her to discuss Bush 's new crumbling strategy -LRB- which they called " escalating " -RRB- , in which a lot of America 's money and children will be spent .
Tom asked Rice , " Why do , the countries of the Arabian Gulf pay ? " .
He did not forget to have Egypt also offer its sons as an alternative to the American soldiers , claiming that what is happening in Iraq is a civil war , and if this civil war continues , the first ones to be harmed will be the countries of the Arabian Gulf .
Their arrogance is amazing .
Are they not pleased that our economic condition has recovered and God has favored us with this abundant good ?
We will witness the mechanisms of bargaining after the arrival of the well - regarded Rice who certainly visited the occupying entity and arranged a new game with it called the establishment of a new Palestinian state to entice us to support it materially and morally .
It is worth mentioning that in his speech Bush criticized the government of al - Maliki .
He was followed by Rice with the same tone and language during her last meeting with her colleague the Zionist foreign minister where she criticized al - Maliki , who is expected to be relieved of his post as another step to entice the Iraq 's neighboring countries , specifically those who crave its budget surplus to spend it on their mistakes and adventures in power .
They are , unfortunately , steps which find those who follow them , monitor them , scrutinize them , and document them in this article .
Let us return once more to the accountability of ministries .
By this means , we can hold companies accountable because we can not ask any particular ministry to monitor , hold to account , and make answerable the public and private companies .
The ministry has nothing to do with prosecution .
If the condition of ministries is good , the condition of the companies that follow it will be good .
This confirms that partnership between the public and private sectors which we are always demanding will not come into being unless we hold everyone accountable and all parties agree to serve the country with the instructions of the noble Book and the honored Sunna of the Prophet .
In conclusion : It is now time to sit together at the table of the country .
The heart of the country is wider than all the places in the universe .

No seminars are held calling for the accountability of the ministries because they are simply answerable originally .
Their violation of the principles of accountability which are part of the nature of governmental work is nothing but a deviation from the normal course , and a deformation of the position it should be in .
In truth some business organizations have surpassed their abilities to create an established answerable business environment enjoying candor , transparency , and accountability surpassing the governmental organizations ...
I ask forgiveness from Almighty God

His affair is with God who is the wisest of judges .
Are we responsible for whether Saddam is among the people of Heaven or Hell ??
Why are we not preoccupied with ourselves and present for them before death befalls us and we are unaware of what awaits us afterwards !!?
What should be mentioned are the good deeds of our deceased Muslims only .
We should not utter the profession of faith for anyone who we felt friendly towards or who we sympathized with .
Let us not forget the uncle of the Prophet -LRB- may God bless him and grant him salvation -RRB- , Abu Talib , and his death in unbelief .
The Prophet eagerly desired that his final deed would be to say " there is no God but Allah , " but Almighty God guides whoever He wishes .
Oh God , we ask you for a good end .
Death suffices for a preacher .

God is glorious .
Emotion is still the thing that moves us away from the facts of the religion by necessity ..
We are not saying that Saddam is among the martyrs who are worthy of honors .. and we are not saying that he has not been pardoned ..
Who is it that makes oaths about God !
But the man has attained what he reached ..
It is nonsense to occupy this place by narrating honors and projecting heroism for a mere emotional situation imposed by the circumstances of his execution .
It is bigger and more serious than this ..
I do not belittle the circumstances and the meaning of the event , and I do not forbid you or myself from discussing it ..
But : we have to seek the ruling of the requirements of faith and refer things to God and His Prophet in every incident and situation so our positions are as well - established as our established facts ..
May God bless you .
God suffices for us and He is the best one to trust .

Car Club in al - Jazirah Newspaper and Women Driving
Expatriate Away From Home
Praise be to God ! Blessing and Peace to the Messenger of God !
The talk about the driving of cars by women took up a space greater than its size .
Some may imagine that it is an issue of bets and the challenge existing between two known currents in our country .
Since the beginning of the month of Dhu al - Qada 1427 A. H. the newspaper Al - Jazirah has issued a weekly supplement every Wednesday called " the Car Club . "
Each issue includes an interview with a young athlete , actor or singer , who talks about his personal relationship with the car .
Each interview ends with a final question : " What is your opinion about women driving cars ? "
In fact , I was not expecting those answers from those people who are not exactly - in my opinion - classified as intellectuals or people holding ideologies , but rather are common people .
I was not expecting those answers in spite of the intensive pressure and the attack launched by our local press , which has a bias for the liberal current , in an attempt to endorse women driving .
I believe it is not love and concern for women as much as this decision is the dream to pave the way for other horizons and projects to liberate women and walk on the path of westernization .
Our attempt , as conservatives , to stand up against issues such as these must not be satisfied with only the fatwas of important scholars , but we must employ other means .
I liked one cartoonist who depicted the situation of a woman in her car while one of the tires failed , and how a young man came to rescue her .
Above his head hearts of love and infatuation were drawn .
This cartoonist supported the issue with his brush and depicted how danger lurks if it is endorsed .
Now we are in need of such ideas more than we need rhetorical speeches that people are fed up with .
Since I think that publishing the statements made by athletes , actors , and singers is one way to help us to serve this cause , and since these interviews came through the newspaper Al - Jazirah , I think that if they had been published by the newspaper Al - Watan or Al - Riyadh they would have stopped this question from being asked to the guest because they are known for their banning of the other and they do not know neutrality when exposing and they do not like these answers . As it happened with the newspaper Al - Riyadh when it halted and concealed the poll on women driving as it saw the overwhelming victory of those opposed .
I leave you with the answers of the Car Club magazine guests to see that there is not one person who explicitly agreed without mentioning the legal regulations .
Yasir al - Qahtani , a player on the al - Hilal team , on 1/11/1427 A. H. , the first issue .
What is your opinion about women driving cars ?
I am for and against women driving cars .
I am for them driving in accordance with the regulations , that is by being over 40 years of age , being unable to afford a driver , and not having a guardian .
But if driving were without regulations , then I think it would be better if women did not drive a car .

There are legal and social regulations which must be taken into consideration and into account .

I thank them very much .
Do you thank them as I do ?
Majid bin Muhammad
A well - known method of Khalid al - Malik whom we used to think well of but who has turned out to be no less malicious than his old friend al - Sadiri ..
We do not know when the opinion of athletes and actors began to be taken on issues that no one but important people used to deal with ..
But it is the time of the insignificant Iyad Madani and those with him ..
As for the cars newspaper , it is a newspaper devoted to reviewing some of the dregs of society such as showing off clothes , once when he is getting into the car and again when he is out of it .
Some of them you are not sure whether it is a man or a woman .
Rather , you do not hesitate to describe him as a third sex ..
The liberal project is a feminine project that starts with the women and ends with the women and passes through the women .
The liberal and the hypocrite are two faces of one coin .

My noble brother Majid bin Muhammad . You have wronged Khalid al - Malik .
But do n't you agree with me that the opinions of actors and athletes were in agreement with the opinion of the important people only , which shows the falsehood of the liberal group that we have a silent majority .
Here the silent majority of the masses agrees with the opinion of the scholars !
Faisal Al Qassem , Al Jazeera Channel presenter : I did not think Iran was that impetuous ?@@@...
Shanar Bin Amer
I did not think Iran was that impetuous ?
Dr. Faisal Al Qassem How foolish we were in our look to Iran .
Iranian politicians were to many of us an example of rationality , wisdom , wit , discipline , calmness , and , above all , premeditation , deliberation , and a lack of hastiness into impetuous action that is not deliberated , especially as they are the inventers of chess , the game of the smart , the witty , and the strategic planners .
It has been known about the Persian mentality that it is innately patient , as is obvious with the makers of the famous Persian carpets .
They are very patient and enduring .
They wait years and years and do not get bored , so that they may weave , with thread and needle , a wonderful Persian carpet , full of adornments , accurate details , and charming lovely figures , while Arabs tend to get bored fast .
But I do not know where those historic characteristics of chess suddenly evaporated in Iranian policy , when the governing organization in Tehran blessed the deed of its agents in Iraq to execute the deceased Iraqi President , Saddam Hussein , on the first day of the holy Eid Al Adha , mutilating his body , swearing and calling him names with profanity while he was on the gallows rope , when Saddam himself had ordered the Iraqi media after the death of Khomeini , to use the phrase " May god have mercy on him . "
Admirers of Iranian wisdom did not believe this fatal lapse of Iranian politicians and their followers .
Some might forgive Iran for its yearning to see Saddam Hussein hanged , as a type of retaliation and revenge , especially as it had fought him for eight long years , in which it suffered hundreds of thousands of souls and extreme losses .
But no doubt , since it is strengthening its grip on Al Hakeem , Al Maliki , Al Sadr , and Al Jaafari , who are holding the neck of an injured Iraq , it could have picked another more wise and less damaging time , for itself and for Muslims in general , to retaliate against its old rival , rather than committing a terrible deed that Arabs , and even all Sunnis , would not forgive it for tens of years , hanging him on what is a holy day for the utmost majority of Muslims .
I do not know how Iran fell in that dangerous trap , even if it were an evil American one , as it is known about Iranians that they are smarter than to fall into American traps , no matter how cleverly and wittingly they are set .
But they fell this time , a terrible fall .
If I were in the place of the wise ones of Iran , I would hang the Iranian politicians who blessed the execution of President Saddam Hussein on the day of the holy Eid Al Adha .
And I hope no one is overnice and says the execution was totally an Iraqi internal affair , because this blatant joke can not even be passed on school students or the mentally retarded .
We all know that Iran can just hint to Abd Al Aziz Al Hakim , who wanted to compensate it with a hundred billion dollars from the aliment of the Iraqi people for its war with Iraq , or to the fascist militia leaders like the Sadr militia , which implemented the execution judgment with the recognition of the Iraqi government , to postpone the hanging , especially as the Americans had confirmed that they were against the execution on the holy day .
We did not hear an Iranian denial of the American announcements about the execution .
Even if the American ambassador in Iraq is a liar and wants to create division between the Shiites and the Sunnis that would have terrible repercussions , the Iranians could have prevented the implementation of the judgment on the first day of Eid Al Adha , in order to avoid the dangerous repercussions for which they will pay the price for tens of years , and in order to pull the carpet from beneath some of the Arab regimes which they now accuse of provocation against the Shiites .
How strange the situation of the Iranians really is .
On one hand , they barbarically offend the feelings of more than eighty - five percent of the world 's Muslims , the Sunnis , and on the other hand , they accuse some Islamic countries of sectarian provocation against Iran , as the Iranians and their allies in the region complain that there are obvious attempts to wedge and create division between the Shiites and the Sunnis on the part of America , Israel , and some Arabs .
This might be totally true ,
but if Iran does not really want to inflame grudges between the Shiites and the Sunnis and seeks to unite the Islamic front and prevent its penetration on the part of the Zionists and Americans , as it claims , why did it give the green light to its agents and militias in Iraq to execute Saddam Hussein on Eid Al Adha and provide justifications on a golden plate for those who want to break down Muslims on a sectarian basis ?
The story of Iran is similar to the story of the one who beat me and cried , and preceded me and complained .
Do the Iranians have the right to complain about Sunni provocation against them , if they are the ones who started it ?
Is n't the one who starts it more unjust ?
Has n't the provocation against Iran become justified after the shameful Adha deed ?
Saddam might be to the Iranians the devil himself , but do they know that they turned him , in the eyes of Arabs and Sunnis , into a virtuous saint ?
Even some Kuwaitis forgave him and had sympathy for him .
Everyone forgave Saddam for all his faults , thanks to Iranian " wisdom . "
If the betrayed Iraqi President knew how he had become in the eyes of the Islamic world after his execution , he might have weighed for the Iranians and their agents in Iraq tons of praise and commendation for the great favor they did for him , of which he had never dreamed .
It reached the level that even his old objectors compared the execution of Saddam Hussein to the assassination of our master , Omar Ibn Al Khattab , at the hands of Abi Luluah Al Majusi .
No , many even declared that his grave will become a holy shrine .
If Saddam was left for ten more years , the man might have died naturally without any ado .
But now that Iran and its agents have executed him in this horrible way , he has entered history by its widest doors , after he had exited history years ago .
This was thanks to the " terrible " Persian " wisdom . "
Saddam Hussein was one with the utmost hatred and enmity to the Persians .
Maybe he used to pray a lot against them , and God accepted his prayers and inspired them to conspire in his execution on the Muslims ' big feast so Eid Al Adha would remain connected to his name for decades and decades .
I do not know how the Iranians measured it , and I do not know why they sacrificed their tremendous popularity in the Arab street in return for satisfying a cheap and impetuous desire for revenge .
A few months ago , Iran was a symbol of resistance , jihad , dignity , and challenge , thanks to its support of Arab resistance movements like Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Palestine , while the popularity of the Arab regimes was hitting rock bottom .
The Iranians had the right to be proud of the glorious victory Hezbollah achieved over Israel .
But now , this victory has totally evaporated in the Arab street , thanks to the stupidity of those who ordered the execution of Saddam Hussein and the dance over his body .
No , the public support for Hezbollah has even turned into a tremendous indignation from Iran and its allies in the Arab region .
I heard a lot of people connecting the Persian enemy and the Zionist enemy , while Iran , until months ago , was the striker in confronting the Zionist and American project in the region .
Iran caused great embarrassment for everyone who has supported its positions in the past .
I have heard from a lot of people who used to defend Iran in the Arab street , and they have totally turned against it and started to call it " dirty Persian " with a lot of loathing and hatred .
In recent months , Hezbollah 's performance in the war with Israel , with Iranian President Ahmadinejad 's announcements , speeches , challenge of the American administration , and his insistence on finishing the process of enriching uranium , used to resurrect pride and dignity in the souls of millions of Arabs and Muslims .
But the scene of Saddam 's execution turned the tables upside down on Iran for a time that might last for long ; let alone the horrible offense to Hezbollah , which lost a big portion of the street .
The proof is that its biggest supporters in Jordan , for example , boycotted the Manar Channel , which used to have great popularity in the Arab street .
The Iranians , with their spirit of revenge , have destroyed the most famous Arab resistance movement , after it was filling the world and occupying the minds of humans .
They even turned the people against it .
No matter how the answers vary , as Mohamed Abu Roman debates , what is obvious is that the image of Saddam Hussein 's execution would cost Iran a lot in the next stage .
It will make its credibility very weak , and it will also harm the image of its ally powers in various countries .
In addition , it revealed that the " Persian - national " spirit that tinctures Iran 's foreign policy and its various positions , far from the claims of enmity to America and Israel , are only used to serve Iran 's interests .
Beyond that , the image of executing Saddam and the repercussions it created cause a large embarrassment for Iran 's allies in the region , like Hamas , Al Jihad , Syria , and many Islamic factions , as well as the political and public powers - in the Arab countries - which stood with Hezbollah and were calling for their governments to " change " their alliances to stand with Iran instead of the United States and Israel .
These powers face a state of strong embarrassment , similar to the embarrassment of the Arab regimes friendly with the United States from its policies in the region .
Those who wanted to quench their thirst for revenge by hanging Saddam Hussein on the first of the Adha holy days are like the libidinous fool who satisfied his cheap lust without knowing that he had caught a dangerous disease afterward .
What did they win ?
Bullying , from Cairo to Riyadh ... facts and observations .
Al Khareq .
As an introduction to the topic , I will recount these two incidents for you :
1- In Al Sewedi district in Riyadh city , I stood in front of one of the mosques ,
and I saw one of the Arab residents in a moment of astonishment while a car was leaving the place at a high speed .
When I asked him what had happened , he stated that three young men had stolen his cell phone and wallet .
I left the place to catch them , and get their license plate numbers .
They had to stop at one of the traffic signs , which gets crowded , and they did not notice that I was behind them .
I informed Operations of the incident , that they were in front of me at the time , and that there was a security patrol I had seen on the other side of the traffic sign .
But I was shocked when Operations told me , " Do not bother with them .
Go to the police department and report it . "
Oh people , the thieves are in front of me ; inform the patrols about them .
They told me , " It is none of your business . "
I told them , " I will not go to the police department .
This is their car number ; if you want them , chase them .
The car might be stolen . "
And I hung up out of oppression ...
2- On the eastern ring road , three young men in a Lexus car caught my attention .
They were noticeably tense and confused .
On the same road , there was a search point .
I informed Operations , and I gave them the car number .
They said there was no report on the car .
I told them , " Inform the search point to check them . "
He said to me , " You want to teach us our job ? "
And they hung up .
After about an hour , Operations called me , and they said , " Brother , do you know where the car went , right or left ?
It turned out to be stolen . "
I laughed the laugh of the oppressed , and I said oh , oh , nation .
-------------------
This is a small part of what is happening now in Saudi Arabia , in general , and what is happening in Riyadh , in particular .
It reminds me of what used to happen in the city of Cairo .
The bullying , depredation , and theft .
But it is notable that the Egyptians strongly and very quickly eliminated this practice , and our Egyptian brothers treated the causes , the most important of which is strengthening the security agency and enforcing police members in the districts and street .
At the same time , they know that the continuation of such actions affect the reputation of the country , in case they continue ; they would eliminate trust in the internal security of the country .
Now , unfortunately , the bullying which was in Cairo moved to Riyadh , the capital , which has recently witnessed robberies , kidnappings , beatings .... etc.
And we are still only watching what is happening now ; the citizen still faces many problems and robberies .
The thief had some shyness before and fear of the security forces , but now , there is no fear .
They are not ashamed ; one of them steals in front of everyone and in the morning , even from a policeman , and this happened in fact .
The citizen now , these things which happen now have become normal to him .
He is used to them , because of the negligence of security members and their indifference to what is happening now , their lack of consideration for the complaints of people and their reports , and the insistence of security patrols that it is essential to go to the police departments to report any security violations , though most reports need quick and instant action .
And because of the complications happening now , the chaos about which we hear and see has prevailed .
Unfortunately , these things were weak in the beginning , but they have grown now and reached the level they reached because of security weakness and indecisiveness toward such issues , which have become a daily reality before our eyes .
They happen in our streets , homes , and cars .
If these shameful practices which are happening in our country are not treated decisively , we should expect bigger than them .
The citizen would be forced to own a weapon to protect himself , at the time when the security agencies failed to protect him ...
I am talking here about what is happening in my surroundings and the surroundings of those close to me .
I saw what is happening with my own eyes , so what do you think of a big city like the city of Riyadh ?
You hardly enter a gathering or house without hearing horrible stories and tales , and the fear , the fear , is for Riyadh to become an example for criminality like the American city of Chicago ...
So pay attention to your cell phone , wallets , houses , and cars , because the situation has become unbearable .
Some time ago , my car was stolen , and I reported it .
The officer said , " May God not offend you , but search for it with us . "
The funny thing is that I found it myself after only two days .
..
As for what is happening in the police departments , we find officers trying to reach reconciliations by all means , because they do not want to tire themselves with an investigation .
The one who commits assault and the victim are equal to him ; if the victim refuses reconciliation , he starts to procrastinate and draw the issue out .
As for the prosecution panel and the general investigation , they protect the gangs and individual criminals , per the system , as they release them from jail on bail without spending a night in it .
The utmost crisis is that the police departments know the locations of criminal gangs .
They know where robberies take place , but indifference spreads in their bodies .
In a short period , no more than a month , several of my relatives and friends were robbed .
One can measure based on that what is happening in the city of Riyadh ...
1- stealing a cell phone in the Quds district ,
2- stealing a cell phone in the Mecca Markets ,
3- stealing a cell phone in Al Roda ,
4- stealing a cell phone on the Hijaz road ,
5- robbing one of our employees in the Markab district ,
6- assault on a military officer , in his uniform , and taking his cell phone in the Markab district ,
7- robbing the house of laborers we know and assaulting them ,
8- assaulting a driver and stealing the car ,
9- assaulting a store owner that I know in Mecca Market , and stealing the money he had ,
10- stealing the tires of one of the neighbors ,
11- robbing his driver 's room .
The situation has become unbearable ...
We are pleading for the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques and His Highness the Minister of the Interior , God protect them , to quickly intervene , to order the increase of the number of security members and security patrols , and to eliminate those practices that give a bad image to our country .

The Ministry of Interior is sick and suffers mismanagement , with its corrupt and uneducated personnel , from top to bottom , in all its sectors .
He who has not , gives not .
The defect is in the officials in the sectors of the Interior , and then its failure in all cities and all sectors is the crisis .
All sectors suffer from a shortage of equipment and supplies , especially the police .
Unemployment is widespread in the society .
Why do n't they hire those young men to fill the shortage , especially when the King of the Ministry of the Interior , I mean , the Minister of the Interior , is the one who has been taking on the unemployment issue ?
Why does n't he hire and fill the shortage in his ministry ?
And why is n't the ministry financially supported ?
Imagine , until now , the police still use handwritten correspondence , written in the handwriting of preliminary and primary school graduates by its employees , let alone the low morale of the members , which reflects on their performance .
The citizen in my country will remain without value , inside and outside , unless he has a say in the hiring of officials and a role in holding them accountable .
Sami Al Jaber .
If public punishments are not applied , the situation will remain the same , and the rest will not be deterred .
- Yes , many are arrested , but where is the punishment ?
-LRB- He who feels secure from punishment misbehaves -RRB- .
Al Kharek
This is a case in which execution was applied among several cases in the Kingdom !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why was execution not applied in similar cases ?
And why did the judges stop at imprisonment for a few years and beating for several rape cases in previous incidents ?
Riyadh - Saudi News Agency :
A capital punishment was carried out yesterday on a criminal in Barida city , for committing adultery in a number of incidents .
The following is the text of the Ministry of the Interior statement in this regard .
God Almighty said : -LRB- The punishment of those who wage war against God and His Messenger , and strive with might and main for mischief through the land is execution , or crucifixion , or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides , or exile from the land .
That is their disgrace in this world ; a heavy punishment is theirs in the Hereafter . -RRB-
Ali Bin Mohamed Bin Hilan Al Harbi lured a number of underage children and raped them by force and against their will .
Thanks to God , the security authorities arrested the mentioned criminal .
Investigation with him led to accusations against him of the commission of his crime .
By referring him to the Public Tribunal , a judicial charter was issued convicting him of the act , and he was sentenced to be killed as a punishment .
The verdict was certified by the Court of Cassation and the permanent panel of the Supreme Judicial Council .
A supreme order was issued to implement the judicial decision against the criminal mentioned .
The death verdict was implemented against the criminal , Ali Bin Mohamed Bin Hilan Al Harbi , yesterday , Wednesday , 12/27/1427 A. H. in the city of Barida in the Qussaim district .
By announcing this , the Ministry of the Interior is confirming the devotion of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques ' government , God protect him , to providing security , achieving justice , and implementing the principles of God against anyone who assaults the secure ones in their selves , honor , or money .
At the same time , it is a warning to anyone who considers doing this that judicial punishment will be his destiny .
God is the leader to the good path .

My brother , Al Kharek , peace , mercy , and the blessings of God be upon you 00 .
You opened a subject on robberies , so we wanted to share in the devotion to God Almighty 0 .
The strangest thing I read was your comment number five -LRB- 5 -RRB- , quoted from the newspaper . 00
In it , the writer mentions that the nation has advanced criminal equipment and trained cadres . 00
Fine , what is missing that led to the increase of all kinds of crime ?
If the reason is known , the result is clear . 0
The problem is not in the unavailability of Islamic legislative evidence upon which Islamic justice is based ; but rather in a reality in which you live and in which justice is excluded .
The judge 00 is not qualified for the judiciary and is not independent .
This is what deprives the judge of his legitimacy in judging , 0 as he follows the dictations of the prosecutor and others .
The judge receives bribes , recommendations , facilitations , and other things , which do not serve the judiciary , but show it is not independent and impartial . 00
This judiciary has remained like this for a long time .
The accused has been a victim between rivals , until , recently , outside pressure came to support the accused , which has enabled the lawyer .
The lawyer is qualified for positive constitutions that contradict Islamic legislation .
This caused the lawyer to use this golden opportunity to release the accused for large amounts of money , estimated at several million in the large criminal cases , which increased the drift of justice . 0
Some judges even quit the judicial profession and turned to legal practice , as he would be a master in the field , since he knows the skills of judges . 00
And we entered the market of crime from there . 0
As for crimes , they are many .
The biggest criminals are known from their looks .
Among them are the organized road robbers , the share robbers , the land and property robbers .
Even dead robbers have appeared , who steal dead bodies .
It is weird .
Thieves are immune to justice .
They even are the justice in our stinky time . 0
As for the agencies , they are developing , and I expect a day will come when the guard will be a thief and and and 00
By using a rational mind and transparent logic , young men who are unemployed , lost , and lazy , raised on the channels that feed and develop them for free , and have a masters degree from the international university of the lost , need a daily allowance of 50 - 70 to dress , eat , and travel around with a limousine , 10 per trip .
A southern guy gets lost in Riyadh .
They collect a thousand for him and tell him go look for a job ; 550 went to tickets , and fifty for the trip from the airport to Batha to rent a room in which to sleep , 100 .
He wakes up , buys application files , and photocopies his identification .
He spreads them everywhere possible until they are hanging from the bridges .
His daily expenses are 50 , with food and beverages , say 100 .
He returns to the hotel to lie down , his face exhausted from the heat , the fatigue , the insults , the name calling , the expulsions , and the humiliation .
Then , he wakes up on his second day and lingers around his acquaintances , knowing that they despise him for his position , and they say , " We swear to God so - and - so has left , and you can do nothing but return to your home and come back next summer when the institutes open , " and and %pw and go .
I went back to the hotel , and he said give me a hundred .
I told him I do not have enough money to return .
I am broke , and I have nothing but my identification .
Take it as a guarantee .
I went back home as an unknown with a copy of the identification ; I spent a week on the road to pass , and all who saw me empty - pocketed said stop in your place .
And we returned after a week , having eaten the remaining pickings in restaurants until the Indians sent us away . 0
This is about the job . 00
As for the land , you either wait for 25 years if you are lucky and feed the belly of the Land Department Director with a sheep , honey , or something he considers good , in order to get it after twenty - five years of feeding him . 0
Or else you go to a planner who tells you that the selling starts on such - and - such date , and the price of a place , twenty by twenty , is 250000 .
If you do not have it , pay 5000 as a down payment and pay the rest in installments of 3000 every month , with a total value , calculated by a Sudanese man , and who knows about his math , of 450000 , for the heirs to pay .
And if you are an installment late , you have no right to anything .
I said , fine , let me see the land , so we went .
We found the land close to the relatives , and it was stolen from the group . 000
Then , our unemployed brother faced a look of inferiority from those around him .
He feels inferior and wanders around .
He meets a companion from the same path and the same suffering .
Here starts the thinking and the change of his compass .
When he sees the luxuries around him , he will move and think .
The door is open , the experiences are available , and the elimination of humiliation and takedown is available .
So he starts with a small theft , then a big one , then a variety . 000
If you look , who are actually Saudis ?
They are foreigners and Bangladeshis , in particular , who are assigned in their residency to their fathers , the big officials of the nation , in his mother 's name and his father 's name , and they were released in the market like a shark .
They took everything .
A Royal Decree was issued , called -LRB- the Reverse Decree -RRB- , which prohibits foreigners from working in vegetable sales .
The young people were happy .
They went to the market , and there he was the Bangladeshi controller .
There they were , like for the petroleum .
The Bangladeshi does not accept less than ten thousand a month . 00
We are in a night , Kharek , that has no morning .
Orders are neglected , the phoenix is burnt , misery prevails , and no one is responsible for anyone .
0 .
Our unemployed brother is the small criminal , the lured one .
He is like the old saying would indicate , -LRB- If you have a penny , you are worth a penny ; if you do not have a penny , 00000 You know the rest . -RRB- 00
This is reality , my dear Al Kharek .
I wish there was independent Islamic legislation in which no one interferes .
And I wish there were an impartial independent general prosecutor to represent national , intellectual , and Islamic security .
If this is achieved , security , prosperity , and freedom would be achieved , and the age of oppression would end .
Calls to prayer and no one hears you , so you wo n't upset your God , even if your back was beaten , and your money was taken .
00000
If nothing changes and we sleep and wake up on the Qassebi and Turki Al Ahmad roads ,
and the corrupt gangs like them to whom the mission of Islam was handed 0.
0000
I swear to God , I get astonished , I thank God , and I say , thank You God , that there are still traits and values to praise . 00
And if you say something , say peaceful things , they are good , though their mentalities are unique and their wills are strong . 0
We are a people most intimidated should a missile or heavy 5 - ton bombs fall near us .
Around it , we shall sink into the ground for a year , and then we come out worried .
Do not count on us as weapons , when we are cowards who learned in the schools of Al Walid Ibn Talal , Ibn Ibrahim , and full cream , Saleh .
This is our university , so do not blame us and do not count on us . 0
The weapon is a cartoon , and the aggression is at the door . 000
Would you explain to us our reality , that we live in this world , and who represents us inside and outside ? 0
Or else what we see is that we are performing a realistic play under commercial stickers of the Bouri and Khori council , who represents his pocket , his interests , and his position . 0
Living became a trade in livestock . 0
Explain to us , the people , what is the meaning of a people ? What is the meaning of gangs ? And what is the meaning of criminals ?
People are confused . 0
==============================
And thank you my brother , Al Kharek .
I hope to publish it if we can .
Maybe we can regain credibility of presentation and honesty in the message .
What we see today in the forum is nothing but fights between the Baseer Bahrani party and people who burn , hide , and mask .
Where are the words of truth ?
Whenever you see a criminal they have caught , you say punish him and , and , and , and , as if he is not a human who lives among us .
We feel for him , because he is the victim of big criminals of the %pw . 00
If he was backed up by a financial or incorporeal support , he would have been honest and would have been propagated as the most honest . 0
The country in reality is a Mafia country of all types and colors .
And the means of criminality were provided by our rational country , until the criminals became holders of scientific and mechanical degrees .

Rejoice , people of Islam .
The toughest of your soldiers against the Antichrist have returned to the truth .
-LRB- Sons of Tamim . -RRB-
Al - Musta'in Billah
In the past , an Arab poet praised this tribe which humbled the thrones of the Persians and defeated their soldiers and their elephants .
Its leader , al - Ahnaf ibn Qays -LRB- may Allah be pleased with him -RRB- , chased their king until he was killed , exiled and homeless .
If the sons of Tamim were angry with you ........... you would think that all the people were angry .
This is only because the sons of this tribe kept their pledge , were loyal , and were steadfast in confrontation and tough on the enemy .
The Messenger of God -LRB- may God bless him and grant him salvation -RRB- , said about them that they are his people .
The alms of our people come from them -LRB- meaning the alms of the sons of Tamim -RRB- narrated by Muslim .
The truthful one and the one proved to be true -LRB- God bless him and grant him salvation -RRB- , said about them : " They are the toughest among my nation in battle .
-LRB- They are the toughest of my nation against the Antichrist . -RRB-
The people of Tamim in Iraq and a large part of al - Ahwaz have returned from the journey of Rafidite Safavid pride .
This is because those for whom a happy ending has already been decreed by God in the written book and to whom the good tidings of this came in the language of the faithful one of the heavens and the earth -LRB- God 's blessings on him -RRB- was not to be left by God in the mire of deviation and the valleys of disobedience .
From the heart I am telling you , sons of Tamim , children of al - Hamayil , al - Butama , al - Shirman , children of al - Kanan , people of Basra , al - Ahnaf , the great Abu al - Khasib , you swords of glory and soldiers of faith and people of Muhammad -LRB- may he have God 's blessing and peace -RRB- :
Rejoice and be hopeful .
God will really not forsake those who support His religion .
Your sale will be profitable , as will be that of Muhammad , Abu Bakr , Umar , Uthman , Ali , al - Qaqa , Zahra ibn al - Huwayah , Ibn al - Mubarak , al - Darimi , al - Nisa'i , Abu Yala , and those in the forefront .
Sons of Tamim , the cry of glory will always resound , striking terror in the adherents of Mazdaism , the sons of whores and group pleasures .
God is Great !
God is Great !
And I am the brother of Daaaaarim .
After me there will be people with the nickname al - Rafida who reject Islam and reject it .
Their mark is that there is no Friday prayer and no congregational prayer .
Let whoever encounters them fight them because they are polytheists .
Al - Tarid
They deserve this ...
For your information there is a large portion of them in the Kingdom ... and an area named after them ... which is Hawtat Bani Tamim ..
Among them are venerable sheikhs such as Muhammad bin Abd al - Wahhab and Ibn Uthaymin

A Word of Truth from Mahathir : " The Execution of Saddam is Public Murder . "
Shakir al - Maarouf
Abridged / The Diary of Islam :
The former Malaysian prime minister , Mahathir Mohamad , considered " the execution of the former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein a public murder . "
He condemned the broadcasting of the execution to the world , describing it as " a travesty of justice . "
In a statement published by the Malaysian news agency Bernama , Mahathir said that " the execution was decided by war criminals -LRB- the American President George Bush and the British prime minister , Tony Blair -RRB- . "
Mahathir , who was a member of the International Committee for the Defense of Saddam , added that the broadcasting of the execution " intended to demonstrate the imperialist power of the United States " .
It was a warning to peace supporters that they had to either prostrate themselves before the orders of the Bush Administration or face the penalties of execution without a legal trial .
The prominent Malaysian official went on to say that the execution was a travesty of justice as " the defense lawyer was brutally murdered , the witnesses threatened and the judges stepped down because of their integrity and were replaced with collaborating judges . "
" Nevertheless they told us that the invasion of Iraq was aimed at strengthening democracy , freedom and justice . "
Mahathir was violently opposed to the occupation which the United States led against Iraq in 2003 when he was Malaysia 's prime minister .
He also demanded several times that Bush and Blair be tried for their crimes .

=== Comment ===
If only you were one of the rulers of the Gulf states , Mahathir , those that facilitated for America - foolishly and stupidly - the mission of invading Iraq . And extended a helping hand to it to destroy its infrastructure , its economic system , its regime and community life .
The Angry North
The statements of this man since he was in his post , were strong and clear , containing neither fear nor sycophancy .
How I wish Moslem leaders had his courage and his sense of zeal .
My brother , the oppressors have gone too far ... so Jihad and sacrifice have become a right
Saleh al - Musannad
Even the one we thought was foolish announced mourning on Sadam 's death .

Will the Capital Market Authority prove its integrity and suspend Al - Waleed now in accordance with its regulations ?
Dirawi
Will the Capital Market Authority suspend Al - Waleed after his conference , as it suspended others in accordance with its rules ?
Al - Kanhal 's 2005 statement for which he was suspended .
Al - Kanhal said that the Sidq Company is an industrial company and one of the founding companies of the Ansab Corporation
And my information is about its good future plans .
The Mubrid Company is a company that owns the biggest land transport fleet in the Middle East , because the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is considered one of the biggest exporting and importing countries in the world .
Speaking of his support for investor ownership in companies , he explained that this phenomenon is healthy due to the presence of a young generation of holders of scientific qualifications and administrative expertise , a matter that changes the policies and activities of some companies to generate a greater profit .
Speaking of his expectations for the Saudi market during the coming period in light of the big growth in some companies , he said : " The Saudi market has a number of incentives that are helping it to grow , these being the proximity of announcing the third quarter , the rise in petroleum prices , and the close announcement of share division and the Capital Market Authority regulations for starting consultants ' and brokering offices .
Speaking of his support for some of the investors expanding into the Gulf markets , he said I do not support that , as the Saudi stock market is considered one of the biggest markets in the Middle East , and investing in it does very well .
We praise God that the daily value of the market has reached twenty - five billion .
This reflects the strength and solidity of the Saudi market .
Finally , he asked the CEOs of companies to apply the regulations issued by the Capital Market Authority at that time to maintain the rights of shareholders .
Al - Kanhal praised the regulations of the Capital Market Authority governed by His Excellency Mr. Jammaz al - Suhaimi .
The new regulations it had endorsed maintained the market 's balance .

Especially as he has a precedent in involving poor speculators with his previous statement some months ago . when he made the market artificially rebound . then he got rid of his shares and profited from the pockets of small traders after they were suspended .
or will the Authority prove its failure and confirm that it is only a scarecrow solely against the poor and the weak .

Riyadh - Fahd al - Marikhi : Photography by Saleh al - Jamia
His Royal Highness , Prince Al - Waleed ibn Talal , the CEO of the Kingdom Holding Company , has announced the pumping of more than 10 billion riyals into the Saudi share and property markets , explaining that over five billion riyals will be distributed to a number of sectors , these being : the banking sector , through the increase of investment in the Samba Financial Group to make its share larger than 5 percent ; the industrial sector through the increase in investment in the National Industrialization Company to increase the share of the Kingdom Holding Company to more than 10 percent ; and the food production sector through the increase in investment in the Safola Company to make its share larger than 13 percent ; and the media sector through a new investment in the Saudi Research and Publishing company of a more than 25 percent share in the company , in addition to the investment in a number of companies that will soon be publicly listed on the Saudi stock market , such as the Mid Gulf company in the insurance sector .
During a press conference held be him yesterday at the Riyadh headquarters of the Kingdom Holding Company , Prince Al - Waleed explained that the pumping of this money has taken more time than anticipated , but confirmed that it was not for speculation but for investment purposes
the relevant state authorities have been informed of these investments in accordance with the transparency principle in use
Prince Al - Waleed explained that the remaining five billion were invested in the property sector that included the Riyadh project which will be launched in the first quarter of the current financial year , and the Jeddah project which will be launched at the beginning of the coming year indicating that an area of 165 million square meters of land had actually been purchased by the Kingdom Holding Company in Riyadh and another area of 53 million square meters in Jeddah for the establishment of these two projects . and a study undertaken to turn these property companies in the future into ones publicly listed on the share market .
The total costs of the Jeddah project is expected to amount to approximately 50 billion riyals and will turn the map of the town upside down .
It includes a high multi-purpose tower ,
and the project will also include a residential district with an area of 2 million square meters , shopping areas and an educational area as well as areas for commercial offices , entertainment , tourism and hotels .
The possibility of developing a diplomatic quarter is being examined at present , while taking into consideration all the required specifications for this quarter .
The entire planning for this project is being done by a Canadian international company .
Speaking of the Riyadh project , Prince Al - Waleed said that it is situated on the Dammam road .
The project , the execution of which will start shortly , will include a tourist resort project managed by Fairmont
The total value of the investment upon completion of the project will be about 25 billion riyals , and it will include a residential quarter containing 135 thousand residential units .
Prince Al - Waleed reported that he had previously mentioned that the market was facing danger some five months prior to its collapse last February , pointing out that when the stock market surpassed the 20 thousand points , that was exaggerated and illogical because the Price Earnings Ratio in some companies were reaching a thousand riyals and that was not possible .
That collapse was expected , not to mention the speculation that occurred .
With the revival of the petro-market and the increase in the Kingdom 's revenue , both of the government or the citizens , there was a lot of money and limited investment opportunities ,
so inflation occurred , leading to the collapse and not a single Saudi family escaped being hit .
Even in the current market situation , if we compare to the Price Earning Ratio then it is still logical and realistic ,
He pointed out that current share prices were logical and reasonable . and demanded investors stop speculating because that leads to many bankruptcies .
He said that there are companies on the market in which profit potential was nonexistent .
He applauded the decision of the Capital Market Authority to suspend dealings of the two companies and said that it was a wise decision but it had come too late as there were fears from speculators of suspending the shares of other companies , and this is one of the state 's rights , to suspend dealing in the shares of companies that were hopeless .
He indicated that there might be other companies whose shares will be suspended and that investors should buy into companies that , it was hoped , would remain and continue .
Speaking of the timing of this announcement and the reasons for it , Prince Al - Waleed said that the undertaking to pump 10 billion riyals into the Saudi market was made last March and that the investment he had undertaken was not completed till two weeks ago and therefore it was being announced .
He hoped that the market had hit the bottom but without any mad rises as had happened in the past , as they were short - term paper profits .
He expected that the current year would witness the restoration of equilibrium to the Saudi market after reaching a kind of sensibility .
He explained that the Saudi authorities were insistent on driving out the speculators who were pushing the market into harming them and the small investors .
He pointed out that the market is looking for a bottom to hit thereafter to be able to rise in a logical and reasonable way
He indicated that the market was looking for a bottom at 7000 points or slightly less .
He added : " We do not want the Saudi stock market to return to insane and unacceptable figures as it did in the past the Kingdom Holding Company is investing in the market to restore confidence in it .
More importantly , the investor must be educated to invest in companies that have a good future . "
Prince Al - Waleed confirmed that the Kingdom Holding Company is continuing with its plans to list for sale a percentage of its shares agreed upon with the state , to reach a figure that serves the Saudi citizen and does not harm the future interests of the Company and its expansions .
He stressed that even in the current market conditions the company would be listing its shares on the market in the current year .
Speaking of the downturn on the stock market in light of the increasing petroleum revenues and the record budget achieved by the state during the last two financial years , Prince Al - Waleed said that the stock market is a mirror of the Saudi economy . but if the stock market was exaggerated then there would be a difference between the state of the Saudi market in general and the stock market and this is what happened .
He offered a number of suggestions to the Ministry of Finance and officials to help the companies , namely : to allow companies to buy their shares immediately which would give trust in the market and would reduce the number of dealt in shares on the market and thus increase the amount of profit ; to allow non-Saudi companies and corporations to enter the market by placing controls such as instituting sectors for shares and an ownership percentage ceiling ; and to oblige companies to disclose future expectations of the companies ' performances .
A discussion with the CEOs of Saudi companies has been initiated by the Kingdom Holding Company by sending them letters dealing with the disclosure of the companies ' future expectations .
This is done by all companies in the developed world with the aim of obliging the company to achieve the declared profit or something close to it and to re-assure the investor .
Finally , more disclosures between the company and the investor , since there are companies with specific profit achieving strategies not from its basic accredited activities , such as achieving non-repeatable profit .
He added : " We wish to remove the weak companies that do not represent the Saudi economy from the market and separate them from the companies with big profits . "
He confirmed that these proposals would be made to state officials to be applied to companies .
Prince Al - Waleed denied that the Kingdom Holding Company had liquidized any portfolio it had in the Kingdom ,
but on the contrary , it had increased its investments in a number of companies , and in addition did not enter into any speculation at all but is working on buying and keeping for investment .
He also denied that the collapse of last February was planned by any party , but it rather occurred because of the illogical prices reached by the market .
He indicated that the collapse was expected because of the inflation in share prices and said that any person familiar with the stock market will confirm that the collapse was imminent at that time .
He explained that the state could not in any way be made responsible for the losses of investors on the market and must remain neutral on that .
The role of the state is to prevent the manipulators from exposing the market to fluctuations , to punish them and to suspend bankrupt companies .
He pointed out that there is a study on dividing the market because it was difficult to place profitable , strong companies alongside weak loss - making ones , and this is where the Capital Market Authority plays a role .
He called upon the investors and not the experience lacking speculators in the market , to go to investment funds and banks to invest their finances in a professional manner , so as to avoid getting caught in market fluctuations and become exposed to losses .
As for the stagnation in Saudi economy , it is not probable , because last year and at the peak of the stock market collapse , the Saudi economy flourished and achieved a 6 per cent growth , because there is a difference in the course of the Saudi economy and that of the stock market .
He asserted that expectations indicate there will be no stagnation in the Saudi economy during the current year due to its strength , especially in the light of the serious strong steps taken by the government to not to concentrate on the petroleum factor .
Regarding the company 's competition for the third license to operate cell phones in the Kingdom , he said that they have an alliance with the Turkish Turkcell Company to compete for this license , and as regards the license for fixed phones , the company will not enter into such competition .
Regarding the investment in the Bank of China , Prince Al - Waleed said that the company had applied to invest as a representative of the Arab world and the Middle East , based on a request made by the Chinese authorities .
He pointed out that the company requested an investment of two billion dollars but had allocated only 300 million dollars for the company and the deal went through .
The profits gained from listing the company 's shares amounted to about 25 per cent .

The Skull - capped One
There is a number of questions whose answers would let us know what the course of the market will be ?
Is Al - Waleed 's view with his team of analysts and consultants that these sinking levels might form a bottom to the market ?
Do these growing profits and collapsing prices form an historic opportunity for investment ?
Will the major investors return with the entry of Al - Waleed as it is generally known that any market has its bottom with the investors and its peak with the speculators ?
Has investment become more advantageous in the medium and long terms ?
Will the course of the market and the method of dealing with it change after a whole year of collapse ?
The features of the answers to this questions will become evident during the coming period , starting from tomorrow .
There is no God but God and Mohammed is the messenger of God .

We are picking the condemnations of Al - Waleed from the news which the writer JARIR has added and providing a commentary in red .
through the increase of investment in the Samba Financial Group to make its share larger than 5 percent ; the industrial sector through the increase in investment in the National Industrialization Company to increase the share of the Kingdom Holding Company to more than 10 percent ; and the food production sector through the increase in investment in the Safola Company to make its share larger than 13 percent ; and the media sector through a new investment in the Saudi Research and Publishing company of a more than 25 percent share in the company , in addition to the investment in a number of companies that will soon be publicly listed on the Saudi stock market , such as the Mid Gulf company in the insurance sector .
During a press conference held be him yesterday at the Riyadh headquarters of the Kingdom Holding Company , Prince Al - Waleed explained that pumping of this money had taken more time than anticipated . but confirmed that it was not for speculation but rather for investment .
the relevant state authorities have been informed of these investments in pursuance of the principle of transparency being used .
Months ago Al - Waleed declared the pumping of ten billion riyals and specified companies that were " respectable " according to his claim .
He won the confidence of some and small speculators entered the market , whereupon an artificial surge occurred , then they were caught in the collapses which followed that made - up surge and which have continued until today .
Al - Waleed had lost his credibility on the market .
He had to change his rhetoric if he wanted to restore his credibility in order to continue his mission of beating the market -LRB- as some believe -RRB- .
Thus he had to specify in his present statement , in addition to the names of the companies , the percentage he owns in each company -LRB- more than 5 % in Samba , more than 10 % in Manufacturing , more than 13 % in Safola , more than 25 % in Research , ... etc. -RRB-
Speaking of the timing of this announcement and the reasons for it , Prince Al - Waleed said that the undertaking to pump 10 billion riyals into the Saudi market was made last March . and that the investment he had undertaken was not completed till two weeks ago and therefore it was being announced .
It is not possible to believe that Al - Waleed had been " only " collecting since last March -LRB- almost a year ago -RRB- until now . Because , if that had happened , then the rates of his prices would be much higher than the current prices .
This would be unreasonable behavior from an opportunist like Al - Waleed .
And so this explanation of his is untruthful .
" He expected that the current year would witness the restoration of equilibrium to the Saudi market after reaching a kind of sensibility . "
This expression seems to have two sides to it :
the first is to send a signal to the Market Authority that he does not want to create a very strong imaginary surge
and this might mean that the Market Authority is being informed that he will be satisfied with less profit than his -LRB- counterpart -RRB- and then get out .
The second : to win the dealers ' belief that the market might have hit the bottom and that they should safely enter with their cash and begin raising its index .
" He explained that the Saudi authorities were insistent on driving out the speculators who were pushing the market into harming them and the small investors . "
In this clause of the statement he is assuring the minds of dealers that does not intend to dispose of his shares to them through this action of his , and so they should enter and raise up the index of his companies .
" the Kingdom Holding Company is investing in the market to restore confidence in it . "
And " more importantly , the investor must be educated to invest in companies that have a good future . "
Here Al - Waleed confirms sowing of trust in the hearts of speculators but only if they enter and give a boost to his companies .
That 's why he finished by saying " educating the investor "
It is the pinnacle of education when the speculators enter into Al - Waleed 's companies and get stuck , since the blow might be final .

Doha -LRB- Reuters -RRB- -
Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres quoted the Prince of Qatar as saying the Islamic Resistance Movement -LRB- Hamas -RRB- would make peace if Israel would abandon the lands it occupied in the 1967 war .
Peres said he also discussed Iran 's nuclear ambitions with Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Thani , Prince of Qatar , during a rare visit to the American - allied Gulf country , his first in a decade .
" In his judgment , if Israel would go back to the borders of 1967 , Hamas would make peace with Israel , " Peres told reporters after the meeting .
" He -LRB- Sheikh Hamad -RRB- says Hamas was elected , and he thinks Hamas is more pragmatic than we think . "
Peres said about the Hamas movement , which won the Palestinian elections in 2006 and refuses to recognize the Jewish state , " I told him that Hamas has refused to meet .
Hamas has announced it will not recognize the signed agreements between us and the Palestinians . "
Israel " should , pay so much attention to their declarations , as they have to please another audience , " he reported Sheikh Hamad as saying in the meeting , which lasted for one hour , and which he described as " frank and amiable . "
Peres said the talks also addressed Iran 's nuclear program .
He said Israel would back increased " economic pressure and a psychological campaign " against the government of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who is a sworn enemy of Israel .
" I do not think Israel has a problem with Iran ; it has a problem with Ahmadinejad , " Peres said .
Peres said that there is " a great deal of dissatisfaction inside Iran " with the policies of Ahmadinejad .
" You can not feed your children enriched uranium for breakfast . You need something more than that , " he added .
Iran 's neighbors in the Gulf expressed their concern over Iran 's nuclear plans , and Saudi officials said that an Iran which owns nuclear weapons could spur a regional arms race .
Peres was the most senior Israeli official to visit Doha in 1996 when he opened a trade office in the country .
There are no official diplomatic relations with Qatar .
Qatar and several other Arab countries ended an economic ban on Israel after it signed interim peace agreements with the Palestinians in 1993 , but relations deteriorated after the outbreak of the uprising in 2000 .

The National Syrian Party in Lebanon , and Very Dangerous Facts
Al Shaheen2005
At a time when the Lebanese judiciary continues its investigation into the file of the detainees of " the Syrian National Social Party , " very important , and at the same time , dangerous , information was revealed about an attempt to blow up the location of a Phalange celebration in Al Koura , which was set to be attended by president Amin Al Gemayel , Minister and martyr Pierre Al Gemayel , and hundreds of supporters of the Lebanese Phalange Party , per an order from Parliament Member Asaad Herdan . That was " Cailion " restaurant in Al Koura on January 15 , 2005 , 29 days before the crime of the assassination of Prime Minister Rafiq Al Hariri , and three months after the assassination attempt of Minister Marwan Hamada , which would have raised the number of crimes and explosions to 16 .
Minister Gemayel was assassinated by gunshots in an armed attack on his procession in the New Jadida sector on the 21st of last November .
Information states that the security official of the Syrian National Social Party , Toni Mansour , admitted in the investigation that , after the Phalange Party set a date for the celebration to be held in the North with the attendance of President Al Gemayel and his son Pierre on January 15 , 2005 , he received an order from Parliament Member Asaad Herdan to " blow up " the celebration .
In implementing the orders , Mansour went with a group of his assistants on January 13 , 2005 , two days before the celebration , to the restaurant , where he started to plant an explosive package containing 15 kilograms of " T. N. T. " substance .
But he was surprised that the timer he had brought had a manufacturing defect , which forced him to postpone the mission for another day .
Mansour states that it was decided to replant the explosive package hours before the start of the celebration .
He went to the restaurant with his assistants , but he was surprised that a security siege had surrounded the place before the time set for the celebration , which forced him to cancel his project .
Yet the ongoing investigation with Mansour and his assistants did not reach a reliable criminal connection between the assassination attempt on President Al Gemayel and his son Pierre , which was postponed for reasons beyond their control in the North , and the assassination crime that was committed in New Jadida on the morning of a party tour by Minister Al Gemayel of the northern party members , which was described as having achieved excellent results .
The international investigation committee , under the leadership of Belgian Judge Serge Brammertz , was assigned to assist in revealing the assassination crime of Minister Al Gemayel .
The procedure the Lebanese judiciary will take against Parliament Member Asaad Herdan is not known , after he was proved to have given orders to Mansour to perform an explosive operation that was supposed to kill the Phalange leadership and its party members .
The Lebanese Constitution states that immunity should be removed from Parliament members if they are pursued for penal crimes , in case the council was in a holding round .
The normal -LSB- round -RSB- period ended at the end of last December without opening an exceptional round .
An explosive package of this size had exploded in several areas in the northern -LSB- board -RSB- , Ashrafieh , Jounieh , and Kasslik , between March 18 , 2005 and May 7 of the same year .
Also , in the framework of this judicial investigation , criminal experts stated that the explosives that were found in the houses of the arrestees of the Syrian National Social Party , together with two hundred kilograms of " T. N. T. " substance , entered the Lebanese market in the year 2000 , which refutes all that has been said , that the explosives and weapons go back to the eighties of the last century when the party was a brigade in the national resistance against the Israeli occupation in southern Lebanon .

Question : I would like to ask His Highness Prince Saud whether the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is ready to raise its production of oil , in case the Iranian crisis causes a reduction of the Iranian production or a rise in prices ?
In other words , is the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ready to use the oil weapon against the oil weapon ?
I would also like to ask with regard to the Iranian crisis , what is the significance of the initiatives that the group of nations , of which the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is part , I mean , the Gulf Cooperation Council , are undertaking in order to develop the project of the nuclear program ?
Is this , I mean , the preparation a group of Sunni Arab countries are undertaking as a warning directed at the Iranian leadership ?
Your Highness , the Minister : We are -LSB- handling -RSB- the issue of facing the oil weapon with the oil weapon , because we do not consider it an oil weapon .
It is wealth to be used , and we are using this wealth in consideration of our national interests , the interests of the producing nations , and the interests of the consuming nations .
His Highness the Oil Minister has very clearly clarified that the policy of the Kingdom is established on balance in the oil market .
The Kingdom has historically proven that in times of crisis , it does what it should do as the biggest producer of oil , in a way that guarantees the stability of the oil markets .
As for the nuclear program which the Gulf Cooperation Council has approved , I believe that among the most important reasons on which the Council agreed in this framework is to enter in this important industry , the importance of which not only includes a military aspect , but also a peaceful aspect , in order to establish an industry subject to strict controls that can not be violated , in order to guarantee its peaceful direction .
And it may be an example for all who want to have this industry and have no intention of developing it , other than establishing nuclear weapons .
This is the goal the Gulf Cooperation Council countries are seeking .

No doubt the political reading today differs from the situations in which the decision was made at that time .
The political situation of the world today has even become more complicated than before .
It ca n't be said that any oil producing country can use oil as a weapon to impose a certain political vision or political position .
It may be one of the most important reasons that the American presence in the region today has become a fact with which we have to live , not to face with any weapon .

It is very hard today to use oil as a weapon .
We will suffer more than the Americans in my belief .

Police and Investigation Authority Agreed to be Unjust to this Sheikh / His Picture
Abd al - Rahman 2002
During the vacation of the blessed feast of Bairam for the year 1425 A. H. , I traveled from Riyadh where I work to my relatives and family in Wadi al - Dawasir to spend my vacation with them happy and joyful .
I was not aware of what fate was hiding .
On Monday afternoon on 13/12/1425 A. H. , I went with my father and my eldest son to the Majid Organization to sell construction materials . Since my father is building a villa that belongs to me .
After we left the organization , we found a number of security men standing by my father 's car .
When I asked them , they said that the car was wanted .
So my father ordered me to go in the car with them .
My father took the child to his home .
At the police station I found a captain named Butayhan Munir who ordered that I be arrested without asking me any questions .
I objected to that asking for information on why my father 's car had been taken and the reasons for my arrest .
At this , the captain said " your father 's car has been reported . "
I asked to see the report and I found that it was for a 98 or 99 model car without a plate number .
I explained to the captain and informed him that my father 's car is a 2002 model and its plates are on it .
At this , the captain said that it was reported by a Sudanese .
Upon reviewing the report of the Sudanese I found that it was about a car whose model and plate number were not specified .
But the captain insisted on his position and quarreled with me and put me into detention .
At this , a call was made to the governor of Wadi al - Dawasir by my uncle on his mobile phone , " later my lawyer " thinking that he was at the Wadi , and an argument took place with him .
He called the captain and told him to put him into the cell and exert pressure on him till he confesses . Because they will raise a complaint against us , if his detention was without reason .
That evening after sunset , as soon as he received the phone call from the governor , the captain took me out of the group detention area .
He asked me to enter the cell and beat me with the assistance of the soldier Yahya Maghfouri .
I slapped Captain Butayhan on his face in return for his beating .
The captain stood up and lit his cigarette , and said , I will put it out in your eyes .
I said , you can not .
He took me into a dark cell with no water or electricity .
I did not know the know the direction of Mecca .
I remained in it for seven days without his asking me my name , or writing a record of my arrest .
Visitors were prevented from seeing me .
He kept my father 's car for a year , without writing a confiscation order for it .
This was contrary to all the regulations issued by the ministry of the interior and by the government , and it is contrary to the system of criminal procedures issued by the monarchy , which require the interrogation of the detainee within 24 hours .
As soon as the captain received the order of the governor , everyone coordinated with Lieutenant Colonel 'Id Matar al - Nafi'i to bring his relative , the aforementioned person who filed the report .
They called him after sunset that night .
He was in Khamis Mashit .
They asked him to come to them immediately because the reported car had been seized . And the reported person had been arrested .
So he went quickly , as he was told to do .
At one o'clock at night " he came to the captain and the lieutenant colonel and they told him that I was wearing a green garment . "
The detainees were awakened .
He took me out of my cell and they brought their puppet veiled so he would not be recognized , because he knew that he was playing a nasty role .
He said hastily " the one in the green garment , " and they wrote down what they called an identification statement , which was nothing more than an allegation , if it were separated from all the conspiracy and fabrication that was obvious from the context of the story .
The conspirators felt confident with their plot .
A week later I was interrogated .
I denied everything I had been charged with .
Then they showed me to the Sudanese people who cleared me .
They showed them my father 's car and they said it was not the one .
Then came two witnesses who were watching the chase between the car mentioned in the report of Saud al - Nafi'i and his car . The Caprice .
They testified that the car with which he had competed was a 98 model , according to his report .
They showed them my father 's car and they testified that it was not the car they saw , so they released me .
We complained to the governor of Riyadh in a letter -LRB- a copy of the letter is attached in the letters and documents section -RRB- , hoping that the conspirators be held accountable and the dignity of the citizen would be preserved .
A committee was formed consisting of the following : Abdallah al - Majyul of the municipality of Riyadh , Brigadier General Faisal al - Mandil of the Riyadh Police Department , and Investigator Faisal al - Ijyan of the Riyadh branch of the General Investigation and Claims Board .
In our complaint we requested to include a member from the ministry of the interior and a member from General Security , but the governor of Riyadh asked that it consist of the aforementioned .
In deference to his wish , a page from the letter of complaint was replaced by another page .
The committee undertook its work on Saturday 16/2/1426 A. H. The following is noteworthy :
1. Lieutenant Colonel 'Id Matar refused to appear before it .
His testimony was through the statement of the chief of police that he was coordinating with the representative of the Riyadh Police , Brigadier General Faisal al - Mandil .
2. The reporter Saud al - Nafi'i refused to appear before it .
3. Captain Butayhan and his other colleagues refused to appear together .
They insisted that the first would come , and then return to the police station , then the second one would come , and so on , so they could coordinate their answers .
4. The committee acceded to their wishes despite our objection .
5. The committee refused to let us see any of the documents of the proceedings and the charges filed against us .
6. The committee refused the request to impound the car of the reporter to confirm the truth about its collision and where exactly it was , especially since the documents of the proceedings are devoid of anything that proves that or proves that there was an accident , as the reporter alleged .
7. The committee refused to discuss with the reporter where he fixed the alleged damage to his car , or in what workshop .
Did he fix it in accordance with an official repair document according to the system , or not ?
Did he know who gave him the repair document ?
If he was given a document , the question is who gave it to him in violation of the system ?
8. The committee refused to discuss with the conspirators and the investigator whether they referred the car of the reporter to three workshops for estimates , in compliance with the rules .
And why did n't they do so , if they were telling the truth ? Especially since private as well as public rights are based upon it .
9. The committee refused to inspect the cell with us to confirm its unsuitability .
10. The governor made a lunch banquet for the honorable committee .
11. The next morning was designated for us to attend to discuss with the committee .
We thought that it would show us the answers of those it had questioned so that we could reply to them .
But we were surprised that it had left the day before for Riyadh .
On 29/4/1426 A. H. the committee returned to Wadi al - Dawasir .
We appeared before it .
It did not open the investigation file and it did not show us anything in spite of our request and our informing it that this was our right according to the system of criminal procedures issued by royal decree .
It claimed that it would show it to us soon , especially the representative of the municipality of Riyadh who apparently was the one who held and controlled the documents of the proceedings .
My father requested the return of his car that had been impounded in violation of all laws and regulations .
It was not given to him and no order was issued to hand it over .
The committee left for Riyadh that day and that was the last time we saw of it .
At the beginning of the month of Dhu al - Qada 1426 A. H. , the office of the head of the General Investigation and Prosecution Authority called me and told me that the head of the General Investigation and Prosecution Authority and the Authority 's committee had fired me from my job and had issued that decision on the basis of the following two reasons :
1. Incompetence during the period of the experience .
2. Lack of trust and consideration .
It mentioned that it was based on the letter of the governor of the area of Riyadh , and that it was appropriate that I submit to the head of the General Investigation and Prosecution Authority my letter of resignation so that my reputation would not be tarnished by that decision and so that I would be able to work in my field , because that decision would bar me from employment in the future .
So I traveled to Riyadh and refused to submit my resignation because this would be submitting to injustice and arbitrariness no matter what the consequences .
Our reputation , thank God , is honorable , and we are acknowledged in the circles of our whole community , and by colleagues in study , professors , sheikhs , and others .
Rather , just the opposite .
This decision would harm my reputation and the integrity of those who issued it , and it would weaken the credibility of the organization which they supervise .
The job is not the main goal , and the doors of livelihood are wide .
Thank God we are affluent .
The noble person does not bend down even if he is poor .
So how about if he is really rich ?
My representative , the lawyer , met His Highness the Governor of Riyadh , Salman Bin Abdulaziz .
We objected to the conclusion reached by the committee .
We told him that we were complaining to him to find justice from him regarding those who were unjust to us , since he is the direct authority of those unjust people .
But unfortunately we were surprised that he committed a greater injustice upon us .
He told us : -LRB- If you want to leave the job then Farraj 's job is with me , and you will be held against me . -RRB-
We said : -LRB- The results contradicted the facts of the proceedings . We were not informed until just now of the committee 's final decision . What is needed is to halt the decision of dismissal , especially since it is based on your instruction , until we are given a copy of the committee 's decision so we can respond to it . -RRB-
He called the head of follow - up and said : -LRB- Show them the proceedings . -RRB-
Then he said : " Give me what you have . "
We went to the head of follow - up , who said : -LRB- I do not have the proceedings , but they were issued .
We said : -LRB- You have the decision of the committee .
He gave us an appointment for the next day .
Then he refused to show us the decision of the committee and recited its results to us .
The results contradicted the facts of the proceedings and proved the truth of what we referred to in our main complaint .
So we submitted a letter to the governor of Riyadh in which we contested the committee and its decision , and we explained the reasons for that .
We stressed that the decision for dismissal should be halted .
-LRB- A copy of the letter is attached in the letters and documents section . -RRB-
He ordered the formation of a committee , according to what we were told .
It was explained that this committee was formed of the head of Follow - up Abdullah al - Qarni , the assistant deputy of the municipality , Dr. Ibrahim al - Subaihi , and two advisors of Salman , Faraj al - Asbali and Salih al - Dayf .
So far this committee has not reviewed the proceedings which is what it was supposed to do ,
and Salman has not responded to our request to " halt the decision of dismissal " until the case is finally over .
Then the head of the General Investigation and Prosecution Authority submitted the decision of my dismissal -LRB- for my incompetence during the year of my tribulation and for my lack of confidence and respect -RRB- to the ministry of the interior to get approval for it while he had promised us to reconsider the decision of dismissal and that the issue was still with the committee .
We learned the untruthfulness of what he said .
So we submitted a letter to the minister of the interior -LRB- a copy of the letter is attached in the letters and documents section -RRB- in which we explained that the decision of dismissal violates the system , justice , and the truth since my alleged incompetence during the period of tribulation was answered and refuted by the performance report in which I received the grade of excellent with a percentage of 96 , -LRB- a copy of the performance report is attached in the curriculum vitae section . -RRB-
And my alleged loss of trust and respect requires knowing the crime attributed to me . And whether or not it was a crime that entails loss of trust and respect as stipulated in the civil service regulations issued by decree of the cabinet and crowned with an order by the monarchy ?
It also requires knowing the final judicial verdict issued proving this crime .
Since all of this is incorrect and does not exist , it indicates the falsehood of this calumny .
The proceedings were returned to the head of the Authority with disapproval of the decision of dismissal because of its violation of the regulation .
When checking back with the head of the Authority he promised something good .
It became clear that he returned the proceedings secretly to the minister of the interior requesting approval of the decision of dismissal .
He refused to give us its number or its date , and he kept the issue a secret while he was promising it to us .
It was revealed that the proceedings were returned to him again . And that he justified his refusal of the previous instruction on the invalidity of the decision of dismissal which was according to the instruction of the governor of Riyadh and his insistence on my dismissal .
Then we found out that he had kept the previous decision and its proceedings including all the explanations in it , and issued a new decision through his committee terminating my services without mentioning a reason .
It was signed by the minister of the interior and it was submitted to the monarchy .
It turned out that the person who was refusing to approve the decision of the head of the Authority to dismiss me was His Highness the deputy Minister of the Interior .
Taking into consideration that since we knew that the head of the Authority had submitted the decision of dismissal to the minister of the interior , my lawyer tried to meet the minister of the interior more than once , but he was not able to .
He asked to make an appointment to meet with him and he was given an appointment for three months later .
Two days before the appointment he was notified of its cancellation without being given a new appointment .
He also tried to meet his assistant for security affairs but he could n't .
My lawyer presented to the minister of the interior our second letter -LRB- a copy of which is attached in the letters and documents section -RRB- .
It was referred to the head of the Authority with no outcome .

Ah my head ! I got a headache while I was reading I do not believe it at all .
Is this article the beginning of a tragic soap opera which will be broadcast in the coming winter days to force people to stay in their homes and get enthusiastic about this soap opera to forget this chilliness ?
Or is it a soap opera to demonstrate to the people the injustice in which they lived before the rule of the House of Saud over this good country ?
Or is it an actual picture in the country of monotheism and justice ?
The case apparently -- God knows best -- involves a biiiiiiiiig head .
God is greater than everything .
The case has hidden threads .
God knows best .
The case has something in it .
What it is I do not know !
The case has something in it which was not revealed to us .
They may be right in this or they may be first rate evil doers .
In general I 'll say you should do one thing .
If you go to Him and take refuge in Him your problem will be resolved .
Yes , it is God , the One and Only , the Glorious King of kings
Use the arrows of night .
They hit their target .
Peres says : All Qataris Want Hamas .
Al - Wajba .
Al - Wajba salutes you and says : Passing by the Saudi airspace , Peres arrived in Qatar for a short visit to the Qatar Debates program with a special invitation since there will be a miniature democratic seminar to study and discuss a number of issues and the ways of tackling them ...
The Doha Debates are considered to be a miniature source of democracy in a big oasis that gathers the Qataris in a unique mixture of intellectual openness to the world and awareness of all that is happening in an atmosphere removed from any twitching or nervousness in an attempt to solve issues in a totally calm way ..
Qatar 's reception for Shimon Peres came from this angle .. addressing the mind and conversing to create a solution for many pending matters and also to make the Qatari public in particular and the Arab public in general understand what takes place in a democratic atmosphere ..
In Qatar there are many independent universities , both Arab and international , and there are branches of well established international universities .
The invitation was from the Doha Debates program ..
This is a program that gathers together many intellectuals , scientists , heads of state , and others to discuss numerous topics with complete transparency and democracy ..
I was hoping that the Doha Debates program would invite Prince Sultan to ask him about the weapons deal or al - Walid bin Talal to ask him about waste and the launching of the songs channels , or Luluah al - Faisal and her future ambitions ..
Claiming power by being silent is something shameful for some countries as is deluding the people with their silence into thinking that they are powerful while in fact they are hiding their weakness .
I think that dialogue is neither a shame nor should it be rejected ..
You talk to your enemy and discuss with him ..
But the closed door policy .. this is a disaster for the people and a pretense that you are brave through a lying and trumpeting media while in the end you fail in the least confrontation ..
Back to the main issue .. we say who is Peres ?
No one denies that Peres is a criminal .
But who is Peres ?
Peres received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994 .
He shared the prize with both Yasser Arafat and the Israeli Prime Minister at that time , Yitzhak Rabin .
Peres has a special interest in precision electronics .
In 1997 , he established the " Peres Center for Peace . "
In other words , the man is looking for more peace than war .
There is a difference between holding discussions with a man of peace and holding discussions with a man looking for war ..
Peres is also a man who received the Nobel Peace Prize jointly with Arafat ..
Peres spent money establishing the Peres Center for Peace while Yasser Arafat spent money on his wife .
We have n't heard that he established any organization to support the Palestinian people with that money ..
When he took office as Prime Minister Peres concluded successful transactions to acquire weapons .
He also sought to establish a deterrent nuclear program since Israel owns the biggest nuclear arsenal in the world .
All this was during his tenure .
This means that the man thinks and plans .
This is due to his knowledge and studies in his field of electronics ..
Again we say that knowledge is a powerful weapon for any national progress ..
Peres attained this as a result of .. knowledge and proficiency .. in his personality , which helped give him an edge in confronting any situation by putting him in a position of strength , and not weakness ..
Conversely , we see the squandering of money on the other side for trivial things that do not serve the Palestinian cause and do not serve the Arabs and the Muslims .
We find numerous satellite channels financed by Islamic countries , and we also find numerous princes and kings and presidents who spend large amounts of money on their vacations .
We also find that most of the Arab people and some Gulf people live below the poverty line ..
Furthermore , most of the presidents of the Arab and Gulf states do not have any high scientific degree or any sound plan to build a strong country at the scientific level ..
They do not even have any interest in education or in establishing strong universities in the first place , except for Qatar .
Back to our topic .
Some of those who posted pictures in the forum did not mention the topic and did not refer to the reason for the visit .
They just posted the pictures and commented on the topic from their imagination ..
His Highness the Prince receives the man of peace in Israel in an attempt to bring Hamas and Israel together .
All this in consultation with Hamas in Syria and Palestine so as to bring views closer ..
I think that this approach of holding a meeting between Peres and Hamas without preliminary agreement by the leaders of Hamas basically holds no benefit for Qatar .
Al - Doha - Al - Rayah - Quna :
Yesterday morning His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al - Thani , the dearly beloved Prince of the country , received in his office in the government building , His Excellency Mr. Shimon Peres , the Israeli Deputy Prime Minister , on the occasion of his visit to the country at the invitation of the Doha Debates program .
The meeting was attended by His Excellency Mr. Ahmed bin Abdullah Aal Mahmoud , the Minister of state for Foreign Affairs , His Excellency Sheikh Abd al - Rahman bin Saud al - Thani , Head of the government building , and Ambassador Ali Fahd al - Hajiri , the Head of the European and American Affairs Department in the Foreign Ministry .
Peres admitted that his country lost the last war in Lebanon .
He said that this war was a loss for Israel from the point of view of many politicians .
In my point of view , every war is a loss because peace is the best option and is required in the coming period for all parties .
In a special episode of the Doha Debates program yesterday , he said that Israel tried to defend itself in the war which it launched against Lebanon recently .
He said that Israel did not have any ambitions there , and its aim was to deter Hezbollah .
He said that he considered the statement of former American President Jimmy Carter on Israel 's oppression of the Palestinians a grave mistake , and he stressed that Carter should withdraw these opinions .
He said that Israel does not have a problem with Iran but they are against Ahmadinejad because of his desire to eradicate Israel .
Peres admitted his failure to achieve full peace and stressed that he regretted that , and he stressed his desire that Arabs and Israelis should live in peace and that the cycle of violence , destruction and murder of innocents should stop .
..
Without dialogue , how would you know the thought of your enemy ? How would you know his plan ? How would you discern whether he is a man who is looking for peace or the opposite ?
An image from the Doha Debates ..
During the program Peres said that Israel lost the war in Lebanon ,, and that their attack was only to deter Hezbollah ..
In my opinion , every war is a loss because peace is the best choice , and is required in the coming period for all parties .
In a special episode of the Doha Debates program yesterday , he said that Israel tried to defend itself in the war it launched against Lebanon recently . And that Israel had no ambitions there and that its aim was to deter Hezbollah .

Peres admitted his failure to achieve full peace , and stressed that he regretted that , and he stressed his desire that Arabs and Israelis should live in peace and that the cycle of violence , destruction and murdering of innocents would stop .
Peres 's visit to the students ' hall so they could talk to him -LRB- as a man of peace -RRB- and not as a Jew or a war criminal .. that is something normal for any visiting official to be received by university officials .
I think that the picture is normal .
Discussion of the Arab - Israeli situation by the students in a unique democratic oasis in Qatar .
All sides are there .. debating , discussing , arguing in a democratic atmosphere difficult to see in any country ..
I think , in my opinion , that if democracy in some of the neighboring countries is non-existent in the simplest matters related to their personal rights and the demand for them . Then how could they reach to the level of Qatar in gathering this huge number of intellectuals , politicians , and heads of state to discuss sensitive issues that concern the Arab World ?
After Qatar went beyond local democracy and human rights in the country .. praise God and many thanks to His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al - Thani , who established democracy and freedom in the country .. and made Qatar a platform for dialogue .. so the discussion took place in Qatar .
There was disagreement and agreement , and that is something normal as a result of the present atmosphere ..
But on the other hand , we find different meetings without any outcome because of the lack of democratic basis for dialogue .
All that results from not accepting various opinions .
Conversely , as a result of the lack of freedom among the Arab people we find that it is America which is in the driver 's seat and steers guests wherever it wants and takes them on tours without any questioning directed at it .
All this marginalizes the Arab individual as though he had no -LRB- mind -RRB- or -LRB- opinion -RRB- , and you find that the areas he is allowed to talk about are women driving in Saudi Arabia and similar useless topics ..
I would like to explain something to the brothers : Peres 's visit is an internal Qatari affair .
It was announced in the newspapers that Peres would visit Qatar , and it was announced in the three Qatari newspapers .
There are writers in Qatar who have positive opinions as well as negative opinions .
This difference is good and something through which nations and people progress .
That is what happened in the forum .
While he was leaving the hall , a student addressed Shimon Peres with the word " terrorist " .. " terrorist " in English , which caused the accompanying Qatari security to intervene to prevent him from continuing .
But the question now is : Who is better .. Peres or George Bush ?
How many did Peres kill and how many did Bush kill ?
Goodbye .

Whaaaaaaaaaaat a shaaaaaaame .
The girls of Qatar shake hands with the dirty Jewish men ?
Grief for our Arabism .
Pictures published for the first time on the forum .
I have a comment coming next .
Starting from this date , the first of / al - Muharram / 1428 A. H. the identification was transferred to another writer .
The poor slave
Brother Jasim ... may Allah guide him .
There are at least three defects in this exposition of yours .
First - lack of vision :
You describe the contemporary Qatari situation as just a legitimate quest for scientific and technological superiority ..
If we could agree that we fall behind the Zionists and Americans in such fields ... however the problem lies in ignoring all this clear evidence that the scientific project is nothing but a small misleading part of a campaign meant to change the Islamic Gulf and Qatari identity and to remove its established fixed principles in which they surpass everything that the Zionists and the Americans have .
How can you reconcile the will of scientific and technological progress .. and hosting the Asian Olympics or a military base or a Zionist politician or a program like the Doha Debates ?
So ... the purely scientific and technological side can not justify what is happening in Qatar .
*****
Secondly , the contradiction of principle and the dominance of worldly interests .
In your article here , you justified the legitimacy of hosting Peres from the perspective of exchanging opinions , dialogue , and using intellect ...
Would you have held the same position if a terrorist or a well - known criminal were hosted under the slogan of , the language of reason , friendly media dialogue , and openness to the other ?...
Would you accept it if your neighbor hosted someone who had attacked you ??
So ... there are principles that must be adhered to ..
The most important of them is supporting the truth and loyalty to Muslims even if it goes against narrow personal interests ... and the relationship of Saudi Arabia with the Americans ...
Despite my being convinced that it should be limited after the latter 's aggression , it does not in any way reach the level of the relationship of Qatar with the Americans themselves .
-LRB- The tension in the relations with Saudi Arabia recently and the military base on the Qatari territory despite the state of peace in the region are evidence of that -RRB- ...
So how come Qatar is now adding to this with intimate relations with those whose existence and history and reality are entirely connected to aggression against Muslims .. namely the Zionists !!?
A mistake can not be justified by committing a bigger mistake or proceeding further in it !! .
****
Thirdly , going overboard with freedom :
There is a kind of mania in the field of freedom that makes many people think that every freedom is commendable .. While giving free rein to freedom is a recipe for chaos and corruption .. even in the field of speech or science ...
For example , there is no room for freedom in talking about God and His Prophet and His verses since it comes in the context of what brought the disbelievers to hell .
But we used to embark boldly with bold talkers ..
There is no room for leaving the door wide open for discussing or teaching " science and technology " as the theory of development .. or the theories of Darwin .. or how to make bombs or liquor .. or the creeds of polytheism or excessiveness in regarding others as unbelievers .. or the sciences of judging with anything other than the revelations of God -LRB- except by the way of warning against them -RRB- ..
So ... imposing censorship and certain regulations on the work of educational and media institutions is not a matter for censure or a sign of backwardness ... rather it might be a necessary and urgent requirement ... especially if those in charge of theses institutions are non-Muslims .. or if the ones exposed are our younger generation and the treasures of our nation !!.
You might even be filled with admiration of the contradiction in attitudes when you see the " supporters of freedom " demanding the imposition of government censorship on courses in Koran memorization , charitable institutions , and the pulpits in some of our countries !!!!.
+++
What is happening in Qatar is a political and intellectual penetration in the countries of the region in every meaning of the word ..
The danger they face is very serious ...
Of course , those who want to penetrate us will not declare that ...
Rather , they will hide their aims behind sweet words or promises of providing limited or imaginary benefits ...
Otherwise , we would not be deceived by the trick ...
For many Muslims today their priorities are confused ...
So they weigh things without the guidance of God ...
This is the real reason for our present situation .. not just because of scientific or technological backwardness .
-LRB- You will find the Jews and polytheists the ones most hostile to the believers -RRB- .
-LRB- God forbids you to turn in friendship to those who fought against you with regard to your religion and who drove you out of your homes and who helped others drive you out .
Those who turn to them are evildoers -RRB- .
There are four types of men :
The man who knows and knows that he knows .
He is a scholar , so ask him .
The man who knows but does not know that he knows .
He has forgotten , so remind him ...
The man who does not know and knows that he does not know .
He is ignorant , so teach him ...
And the man who does not know and does not know that he does not know .
He is a fool so reject him ...
Abu Karam
I am a programmer and a computer systems analyst ..
I took a course at the General Administration Institute in the field of computers and Qatari trainees attended the course with us ..
What happened was that after two days those Qataris disappeared and I never saw them again ..
I saw them a week later in the restaurant of the institute .
I asked them " I hope that nothing bad has happened . Where have you been ? you have n't attended with us .. "
They said ,, The lecturer comes in , gives the lecture , and leaves but we do not understand anything even though he is an Egyptian Arab ..
We decided to transfer to a course that is easier than this one in the field of administration .
The director of admissions understood our situation and accepted the transfer to a program in administration .
So why should we go back to Qatar without getting a degree ? "
But you , al - Wajba , are sitting here philosophizing , telling lies , and saying that you have an advanced educational system .
And by the way , there were also Omanis with us , and they completed the course normally with us ..
In the first place , the course was in the C++ language , which is easy , but such is your education that maybe you do , even know anything about Access ..
Anyone who heard you would say that you went into space or that you had separation surgery for Siamese twins ..
I say God have mercy on Mazna .
Assistant 1
Shalom , al - Wajba ... It is really you and not the Qatari people ...
You are a rich meal for every enemy of the Arabs and Muslims ...
Congratulations for having Peres , and shalom to you from Sharon whose health you pray for so he can finish off what remains of Hamas .
Shalom to you and to Peres , but do n't lie and say he came to you through Saudi airspace .
But you are excused since it seems that you do not know where he came from .
I do n't blame you if those who are greater than you do n't enter the American base ......
It is enough that he reached you and you were careful about his security and comfort .
Here is this link .
It will be useful in situations like yours ....
God bless the sheikh , the father whose hand was not polluted by the hand of the " man of peace " as you say , Peres , and remained honorable and dignified .

That idea of the Saudi airspace is nice , but what is nicer than that is playing host to the democratic enemy in your land ...
But my opinion is for you and the Qataris to discuss with him the issue of murdering innocent children and usurping the rights of others .
Or more clearly , you should ask him to explain to you how to hate your neighbors and maybe he would train you in usurping their rights or train you in killing and shedding blood ...
The phrase " away from any prejudice " is also nice .
Do n't you have any feelings of group spirit , my friend ?
What the Jews are doing does not call for any prejudice or bias .
I believe what runs in your veins is not blood but cold water ...
You justify this visit by this person , whose hands are stained with the blood of the Muslims , and you criticize the weapons deals .
This is normal .
These weapons are for defending ourselves against our enemy whom you receive with hugs and so on .. While those who you say are strong are strong indeed , but not with Peres .
They are strong and we wo n't invite them to our country to discuss their culture which we know and you know .
But you are weak , weaker than a fly .
Therefore you are feigning strength with the descendents of monkeys .
Why should we go that far ?
Previously , your foreign minister likened your small country to Israel .
What a bad comparison and what it was compared to !
You greatly admire the Peres 's education and his academic degrees .
Who else other than you would admire that ?
He is your highest ideal ...
If you were a Muslim , and had an atom of religion , you would not have written this article .
I grieve for myself while I am replying to you , but people like you will not be spared because you are a shame to Islam and Muslims .
The most dangerous agreement that disinherits Iraq from its oil resources is being signed whilst the world is occupied with the execution of the presi-
The Killer of the Killed
The most dangerous agreement that disinherits Iraq from its oil resources is being signed whilst the world is preoccupied with the execution of the Iraqi president Saddam Hussein .
The timing of the American administration 's decision to deliver Saddam Hussein to the gallows to coincide with the announcement by the deputy prime minister Barham Salih of the endorsement of the new draft bill on oil resources aroused interest .
The announcement raised fears that the implementation of the death sentence might be used to cover the issue of oil at this time .
The draft of the law was formulated in complete secrecy , away from Iraqi public opinion .
The draft has been in the possession of the American government for some months according to what the US Secretary of the Treasury said during his visit to Baghdad last autumn .
Furthermore , the Baker - Hamilton report about US policy in Iraq stressed that on pressuring to get the new bill issued .
It seems that the endorsement by the US government of the draft bill on the exploitation of the Iraqi national oil resources is much more important to the Iraqi government than showing the draft to the Iraqi people and having it debated by their independent organizations , its intellectuals , its professionals and the general public .
Unfortunately , the government is concerned with consultations behind the scenes with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and with the American advisers more than it is interested in bringing about the right climate inside Iraq for exhaustive discussions ending with a calm decision in the interests of the nation .
If this climate was impossible in the light of the Occupation and the savage terrorism circumstances and in the light of the lack of the state 's sovereignty , it would be wiser to postpone the issuing of a new bill incompatible with the precepts of the national oil policy , which has been in existence for half a century , until a time when conditions are suitable for a serious debate and for a wide - scale public participation in the formulation of any serious decision to be taken in this sphere .
However , the government seems subject to the United States ' dictates that have expressed in various ways its insistence on handing over the Iraqi oil resources to foreign companies as one of the main aims of the Occupation .
The government of the previous prime minister , Ibrahim al - Jaafari , made an undertaking to the International Monetary Fund to issue a comprehensive law governing the exploitation of oil resources by the end of 2006 , in preparing for soliciting foreign corporate investment in the Iraqi oil industry with long - term contracts .
Exploration and Joint Production contracts adopted by the new draft bill grant companies immunity from other national laws .
It is well - known that the law drafting peddled by the international " houses of expertise " and organizations such as the World Bank market are usually loosely worded and weak , relegating details of the relationship to the sphere of drawing up contracts between foreign companies on one hand and the government on the other as equal sides .
This takes us back to something like the framework of concessions which were abolished in different oil - producing countries by the nationalizations in the seventies with some important exceptions that relied on the then government 's negotiating ability .
This is what arouses worry at the time of Occupation and in the light of the general collapse , the prevalence of corruption and narrow interests , and in the light of the torn national unity .
The issuing of the new oil bill at the present time represents an introduction to the privatization of the main part of the national oil resources in accordance with the conditions drawn up by the Occupation and the International Monetary Fund .
It is not in the interest of Iraq to submit to these conditions under threat and intimation of demands for the former regime 's debts .
The Occupation has brought Iraq nothing but destruction and corruption and it is impossible to confront except by the strengthening the internal front and the position defending the nation 's rights .
Much journalistic noise was raised abroad about the subject of the oil and the distribution of its revenues to the different areas of Iraq .
This is a cause for caution , because the subject is dealt with on the basis of sectarian or ethnic ownership of the oil revenues , at a time when the question of public participation in the oil revenues is a matter almost decided in the constitution despite the deliberately obscure wording of its paragraphs .
It is clear that the agreement of the current regime forces occurred on the basis of general participation in the oil resources according to the proportion of the population in the regions .
Even the two Kurdish national parties know that the greater part of the resources is situated in the South and that their guarantee of obtaining a high level of the revenue will only happen through the sharing of Iraqi resources as a whole .
As such , the exclusion of an area or another is not the main question .
The fact is that the oil revenues are still passing through " The Iraq Development Fund " under the supervision of the United Nations and the United States in accordance with the Security Council resolutions and , consequently , any agreement between the central government and the regions about the distribution of oil revenues will be subject to the guarantee of the US hegemony .
The subject of oil from a sectarian or regional point of view was not presented except as a cover for the important main questions about the oil policy , these being Firstly : the abrogation of Act 80 -LRB- 1961 -RRB- and its cancellation , by successively handing over unexploited oilfields and areas to foreign companies on the basis of long - term participation in production contracts , instead of developing them nationally by supporting the national oil companies and making use of foreign expertise through short - term service contracts that would leave the wealth in Iraq 's hands . Secondly : the weakening of the Iraq 's negotiating power by weakening the centralization of contracting for the national resources with foreign companies and the instruments of such contracting ; not distinguishing between the need to expand the administrative powers of the companies and institutions on the one hand , and the need for the centralization of the major national economic decisions on the other .
It is illogical for the decision about a specific oilfield to be made centrally and the decision on another oilfield to be made locally , as this mixes jurisdictions and divides power solely at the expense of public interest .
The privatization of the oilfields and new oil areas weakens the currently existing national oil industry .
The issue is not just that of the provision of financial capabilities for investment in the national sector or lack of them , but extends beyond that to reliance on policies for developing Iraqi technological and administrative capacities instead of relying on foreign companies .
Technology does not develop in isolation from the ability to make decisions and in isolation from its relation with society and its institutions .
Foreign companies can come and go without any advanced technology establishing itself in the country .
What is therefore needed is a national oil industry , including a national private sector offering technical oil services , and this is what was not developed during the previous regime and what will hamper it as well is the reliance on foreign companies .
Fourthly : achieving an integrated oil policy in regards to the exploitation of the national gas resources and linking it with the production of electricity , oil refining , the development of different petrochemical industries , and industries reliant on intensive energy use .
On this basis , one must caution against companies that try to invest in the production of crude oil without being prepared to invest in the associated and complementary industries .
Iraq suffered a lot from this situation before nationalization .
Fifthly : the crude oil production sector is not just that of the production fields , but that of facilities and complex production services and of cargo and transport services that require a wide inter-governorate network in which different production units in the country participate .
This requires a national oil policy .
Practical experience shows that following the market system in the sphere of public facilities is an extremely difficult administrative matter and failure in it is almost certain .
It is better to keep these facilities under public administration in all circumstances , and work to develop the administrative capabilities .
A unified national policy is an unavoidable necessity , and regressing on it would compromise national interests .
Sixthly : Break the relationship between oil and national economic development , because bringing up the question of distribution equity on the basis of dividing oil revenues among the regions in accordance with population ratios is a concept to a large extent incompatible with that of exploiting oil resources for development .
The important thing is to move towards investment in a way that will encourage the unemployed production capacities , and that will provide the necessary conditions for an effective , private national activity , not one that relies fully on deals and contracts with the government , whether local or central .
This kind of developmental activity can not be based in a single region or governorate ; instead it requires coordination in accordance with a general national program .
The important thing is not the equitable distribution of investment but the equitable and fair distribution of the benefits of the investment .
As we know , most of the financial investments made by the Reconstruction Council were in the northern region but the most significant impact of its benefits was on other areas .
This was also the case with many of the investments in the seventies , as the greatest part of the major oil and industrial projects , the oil projects and the ports are in the southern region .
Nevertheless , the benefits would have encompassed all if it was n't for the destruction that resulted from the wars started by Saddam Hussein .
The most important thing then is integration and striving to provide the minimum level of basic needs in terms of food , accommodation , education and health for all the citizens without discrimination .
It is unreasonable for us to seek solutions to the electricity problem for each governorate , or that we have local water policies in Mesopotamia .
Seventh : discussions are to be held about the cash distribution of part of the oil revenue ,
and this too will not lead to equity , nor to development and attaining public interest .
It is well known that the notion of the individual cash share from oil revenues is an alternative to the provisions ration , and not a supplement to it .
On the other hand , the effect of this change on inflation and on the extent the minimum level of basic needs would be provided for the poor sectors will be negative , and will have inherently harmful economic effects in the present period due to the lack of conditions for productive economic activity .
Also making this change could provide an additional opportunity for corruption in implementation .
The idea is drawn from the experience of the US State of Alaska , and it means moving away from public investments even in the vital sectors , as it is an alternative to providing electricity , water , health services and public education at affordable conditions and prices .
Finally , oil policy will be an important part of the Iraqi national state reconstruction and its rise from the present destruction .
The invitation is going out to all Iraqi patriots of various political and social hues who believe in the current political process and those who are outside it , and to the local and civil community in general , to reject the idea of a new oil bill being issued at the present time and for it to be postponed for at least a full year to start the debate about the future of the oil policy that stresses peace and the ending of the occupation as the basic requirements for a national oil policy .
As for bringing up hopes of speedy prosperity by accelerating production using foreign companies , that is a mirage as the companies will not come except under favorably secure conditions .
Also , the main economic problems in Iraq currently do not lie in the diminished oil revenue , but in the occupation , the security situation , the widespread corruption and theft , the dissolution of the state , the loss of the oil resources and the breakdown of economic activity .
How similar is present to the past .
The responsibility lies in particular on the shoulders of the members of the current National Assembly , notwithstanding their loyalties , and they must ask themselves : if the Kuwaiti National Council has been opposing for years the foreign oil investment project in Kuwait , and if Saudi Arabia and Iran are still holding to the nationalization of oil in their countries , are they ready to revoke Act No. 80 ?

75 % of Iraqi oil to foreign companies and 25 % to Iraqis .

After Forcing Her to Get Divorced , Saudi Woman Prefers Prison to Returning to Her Family
Sarah al - Hamad
The divorce case for inequality in lineage took a new turn , yesterday morning , when the wife refused to be handed over to her relatives in the police station of the governorate of al - Khobar , especially since the Saudi public , which has been following the case , was expecting that it would end after the Supreme Court , which is considered the highest judicial authority in Saudi Arabia , reached a verdict confirming the separation of the couple .
Al - Watan has learned from security sources that the police of the governorate of al - Khobar submitted an official request to the administration of the prison at al - Dammam to bring the inmate Fatima on basis of the verdict issued by the Supreme Court two days ago , and the demand of members of her family to hand her over to them as her sole means of support .
The sources added that when the wife entered the police station of the governorate of al - Khobar accompanied by some female prison guards and security men she was received by some of the members of her family and her mother with the aim of receiving her .
The surprise was the refusal of Fatima to go with them .
In spite of the endeavors that lasted for several hours , her brothers were unable to convince her to go with them to the house of the family in the governorate of al - Khobar .
Officials in the police station of al - Khobar were embarrassed by the situation , because of the wife 's insistence not to go with her relatives .. While the law stipulates that the wife be handed over to them .
So the officials just returned her to the al - Dammam prison to end the issue , and try to convince her in few days .

Previously an article about the conduct of the husband was published in this forum .
The posting of the article revealed other aspects .
He published copies of legal documents because he wanted to use them to prove that the issue was not based on inequality in lineage , but that it was related to behavioral aspects of the man ,
foremost among them is desertion and abandonment for a long time .
Now the newspapers , which I do not trust , still declare that inequality in lineage is the reason .
In fact , a lot of talk is circulating among people about this issue , because accepting the notion of the possibility of separating a wife from her husband by a decision outside the relationship -LRB- or even inside it -RRB- on the basis of disparity in the relative streams is a matter that robs the society of sleep and causes an exploding moral and social crisis which will have no end .
If what was previously published in the forum is true , that the man was separated from her for other reasons , that would be reassuring .
ِAnyway , transforming tradition and calling ignorance a legitimate basis for a verdict in a certain case is a matter which can not be accepted , believed , or trusted to be connected with Sharia .
Sharia is unequivocal and straightforward .
No one was forced to accept and consent to any marriage .
The glorious legislator would not have placed the decision of matrimony in the hand of the guardian and put conditions on it , and facilitate a legitimate alternative for him in case of his absence , unless the decision was final .
Then would someone come afterwards to annul this and lean on the -LRB- Revelation -RRB- in such a thing ???
As I said : if it was true that equality in lineage was the reason for the separation then may he perish , may he perish , may he perish !
This is a first and last point of view ...
Al - Ahnaf bin Malik
There is no doubt that Abd al - Rahman al - Lahim and his entourage of pretenders of liberalism are dancing with joy at the judge 's verdict .
They will be eager to exploit these former couples to bid on justice in our country and on our country in western organizations , so political pressure will increase on us to incapacitate the legitimate judiciary .
The problem with al - Lahim and the pretenders of liberalism is that they want to judge our Islamic values by western standards .
That 's why we found al - Lahim impertinently declaring to the newspaper Al - Hayat that this verdict contradicts the articles which the kingdom signed in the memorandum on human rights ...
In the countries of the west , any man is taken to prison when he marries another woman in addition to his wife or when he marries a woman less than 18 years old .
Any father is prevented from interfering in the affairs of his daughter , even if his daughter works as a prostitute , after she is 18 years of age .
In the countries of the west , you are not granted citizenship until you promise to respect the rights of gay men and lesbians .
You are even given a written exam on your attitude towards them ... and much more than that .
The pretenders of liberalism want to exploit our country 's signature on some human rights treaties in order to force our society to accept values and habits they do not recognize .
The case of this couple was exploited by our press which is controlled by the pretenders of liberalism in order to outbid on our judiciary and tarnish its image in front of the people here and abroad .
The judge who tried this case was frank when he based his verdict on the benefit and harm resulting from the continuance of this marriage .
There is no doubt that many sympathize with this woman , and I am one of them .
But there are other girls in her tribe who are not married .
It is our duty to sympathize with their tragedy when suitors shun them .
If the pretenders of liberalism who undertook the defense of this couple have one atom of credibility , they would have exposed to us the other face of this lying and deceitful husband who was exposed by his first wife .
But as usual they do not know credibility .
Rather it is incredibility as long as the margin of freedom available to them to criticize our religion , our values , and our scholars is very wide .
Considering benefits and harms is applied by many countries in their positive judiciary .
But fifth columnists and the allies of foreign embassies who get paid in dollars by western organizations have an agenda and jobs they must do .

Separation of the couple for inequality in lineage .
Saudi public opinion has not been occupied lately by a social case as much as it has been by the case of the separation of a couple for inequality in lineage after they had two children and desired to continue their conjugal life .
Days ago the Court of Appeals in Riyadh confirmed the verdict issued by the court of al - Jawf for the couple to separate ..
According to the defense attorney , Abd al - Rahman al - Lahim , this means that the case is closed as far as the judicial aspect is concerned unless new and productive facts come into existence in the case .
I am not here to discuss the judicial verdict , or to proceed in the context of the different viewpoint of the defense .
There is total respect for and confidence in the verdicts of the judiciary .
But what I would like to refer to in connection with this issue has to do with the necessity of educating people about equality of lineage in marriage before one finds oneself involved in the same fate as that of Fatima and Mansour .
There is a large portion of people who get married without keeping in mind - out of ignorance - this issue , which can threaten their family life at any moment when a member of the wife 's family objects to the lineage of the husband .
I declare that I have attended many marriage ceremonies during my lifetime .
But I do not remember even one marriage official who brought up this issue by asking the groom about his lineage before finalizing the contract .
He ought to have done so as long as this issue has such a level of consideration .
It can threaten the family life of the bride and groom at any future moment .
Therefore , the educational and religious institutions in the country are obliged socially to educate the society in a more profound way .
There is no stronger evidence of the ignorance by a large sector of the possibility of separation because of inequality in lineage than the social debate stirred up by this issue , which was not limited to the common people but extended to writers , cultured people , and lawyers , foremost among them the defense lawyer who issued a statement after the verdict was issued by the Court of Appeals expressing that he would continue to stick to his position with regard to the verdict that was issued .
Maybe it is also the duty of our media institutions which presented this case to the public opinion by following the verdict issued by the Court of Appeals with intensive interviews with a number of jurists and scholars concerning this and other issues .
This case revealed that there are many things that we lack knowledge about as a society before we plunge into the debate of issues with others .

Assuming that the couple 's order of separation is traced to what are referred to as " behavioral aspects " such as the desertion of the husband and a long - term conditional divorce , what should the wife do , I wonder .
Hold on to her husband and prefer prison to going with her mother and siblings ?
Then ... is the court entitled to interfere between a husband and his wife for flimsy " behavioral " reasons which the wife accepts ?
It seems that the supposition to which you referred in your participation is illogical .
And what is " behind the hill " is the issue of " equality in lineage , " nothing else ...
I do not think that there is one Muslim who accepts the verdict of the Supreme Court because it is a racist verdict and blatant interference between a husband and his wife for trivial reasons .
It is really shameful that the judiciary system in our country works to entrench racism in the name of religion .
The Islamic religion is innocent of this ignorance , as we know .
It is also shameful that the poor woman is alone in the dark prison instead of with the relevant charity associations extending a helpful and caring hand to her .
Since when has prison been a social services center ?
Then where is the Saudi Human Rights Society , considering what is happening to this woman ?
Do n't those in charge of the society know that what is happening to the -LRB- Muslim Arab Saudi -RRB- woman harms us all , not to mention that it is a blatant violation of human rights ?

God suffices for me , and He is the best agent .
Mansour al - Taymani , according to his former wife Ahlam , is a man with drug - related cases against him by the police of al - Jawf .
And morals cases .
The wife appeared on Al - Ekhbariyah channel to expose the man .
Why all this sympathy ?
God suffices for me against you liberals who defamed Fatima .
A question : do n't you think that Fatima was subjected to sorcery by this al - Taymani ?
And say , my Lord , increase my knowledge .

Mr. Ta'abbata Shayan
The former wife is not a trusted source of information for a very simple reason , namely that she most likely still bears some grudge against her former husband and against the woman who " stole " that husband from her .
Really , what would urge this woman to say what she said about her former husband in a program watched by everyone ?
Does her conduct have any connection with noble morality ?
The ones who defamed the wife , my dear , are undoubtedly the racist judges and the relatives of the wife .
By the way , Ta'abbata , can we say -LRB- by analogy with what you mentioned -RRB- that the racist judges and the wife 's relatives were exposed to the sorcery of the former wife , Ahlam ?
and why not ?!!...
Have n't sorcery and liberalism and other amazing concepts become worn out excuses used by some to avoid facing reality frankly and courageously ?

Saddam Hussein was able to prove to the world the stupidity of the Rafida .
Talal
Peace be upon you and the mercy of God and His blessings
Yes , Saddam Hussein was able to prove to the world the stupidity of the Rafida .
Do n't you agree with me that the Safavid Rafida revealed to the world their stupidity when they showed the Arabs in general , and the Sunnis in particular , their hidden hatred and limitless detestation , and revealed their dirty plans and policy .
Yes , they are stupid because they revealed their true colors and proved to all Arabs that there are plans for major loathing and hatred for all the Sunnis in the world .
Yes , they are stupid otherwise what is the benefit of executing Saddam Hussein at this time ?
For Saddam Hussein , there was no difference whether he was executed today or tomorrow or on a feast day or otherwise .
Yes , they are stupid because they did not harm Saddam but themselves , as they revealed their wickedness , their cunning and their coming danger and to all Moslems , Arabs and Sunnis .
They were so ensconced in their deep hatred that they did not observe the holy months or at least the rule of law .
Yes , they revealed to all the Arab peoples in Egypt , Saudi Arabia , Libya , Jordan , Sudan , Yemen , Morocco , Algeria , Tunisia and Syria their treachery , loathing and hatred for them .
The idiots gained nothing but the hatred of the nations for them .
Rather they made Saddam Hussein a believing martyred hero .
Why are we sad ?
Many Arabs did not like Saddam and were not happy with many of his deeds , but after his execution in this way everybody sympathized with him .
No one blames Saddam for what he did with those traitors , sons of temporary marriages , Safavids , whose noses he rubbed in the ground .
Yes , these traitors proved that no one but a ruler like Saddam Hussein can make them act straight and control them .
Why do we grieve for a man whose last words were " I bear witness that there is no God but God and I bear witness that Muhammad is the prophet of God . "
All witnessed the execution of the genius brave leader Saddam Hussein , and witnessed his bravery .
Those Safavid Rafida crowded together in front of him , cursing and mocking him as if they were children .
But he stood pround and strong as we were used to him being .
I swear by God if any of these traitors had been in Saddam Hussein 's place you would have seen him weeping , begging or at least fainting more than once .
These idiots did not know that they had made a martyred , believing hero out of Saddam .
They only proved to the world his bravery and his might and , on the other hand , they proved to the world their hidden hatred and their lack of manners .
The mentally deranged Moqtada Perfidy -LRB- one becomes aware that he is a child if he speaks -RRB- also al - Hakim -LRB- the greatly malicious one -RRB- and Al - Jaafari and Al - Maliki and Muwaffaq al - Rubaei and many of those traitors were also preent so that they could satisfy their thirst for revenge on a leader whose bravery and struggle the world attested . and who suppressed those traitors who only worked for the interests of a hostile foreign state -LRB- such as Iran and America -RRB- .
Why this mockery and shouting of petty slogans such as " Saddam go to hell " and " down with the tyrant " and others ?
Was n't there a sensible man amongst them ?
Yes , those Persian Safavids proved without doubt to the world that they do not use reason in their dealings , but that they deal in hate and loathing .
Yes , those idiots proved that they are behind everything that is happening to the Sunnis in Iraq and all this is no one 's setup but theirs .
Do n't those stupid traitor Safavid Rafida collaborators know that they have not hurt Saddam but themselves ?
For they proved to the world that they are a stupid people , a people of hate , a people who loath the Sunnis all over the world .
We know that Saddam was not ever a traitor or lackey but that he was a brave militant leader and died a martyr .
We know that an offer was made to Saddam to save his skin , leave Iraq and live as a political refugee in any state he wanted but he considered it a betrayal and continued struggling until he was martyred .
We know the Americans offered Saddam Hussein his release when a prisoner , to go to any state he wished in return for stopping the Mujahideen but he refused and considered it a betrayal .
We know that whoever overthrew Saddam Hussein was none other than your crusader masters and that you are too small to overthrow Saddam Hussein , and that you are nothing but lackey traitor scum .
We know that your hatred of your master and executioner Saddam Hussein only comes from the fact that he is someone who knew how to keep you in check and trampled on your necks with his shoes for more than thirty years .
That 's why all nations of the world do not blame Saddam at all , and realize that it was the hidden hand of the Rafida and the Persians of Iran that were behind what happened in Halabja but Saddam struck them with a fist of iron .
The Rafida and the Persians of Iran were the hidden hand in the assassination attempt against him in Dujail but Saddam struck them with a fist of iron .
The Rafida and the Persians of Iran were the hidden hand behind the failed coup attempt in '91 but Saddam struck them with a fist of iron .
The Rafida and the Persians of Iran were the hidden hand behind the al - Khobar explosion in '96 and also the Lebanon War in as well as the current sectarian war in Iraq .
Only an ignorant human being would blame Saddam .
Praise be to God that the way of executing Saddam Hussein was the most clear message to all Arab leaders and peoples that the Rafida and sons of temporary marriages are evil and danger has come near , take care , take care .

A Saudi woman issues a voice recording in which she mourns her brother and demands the punishment of his killers .
HAD1999
In a unique way , a young Saudi woman has resorted to issuing a sound tape in which she mourns her brother murdered in Hafr Al Batin , in the hope of rekindling interest in his case , in which 3 young men were accused of killing him and which has not so far been resolved .
The tape contains excerpts of poetry , dramatic voice recitals , detailed accounts of the young man 's murder circumstances of the background to the investigation of the case for which the young woman is demanding expedited proceedings and punishment of those involved .
The details of the case go back 4 years to the time when the girl 's brother , Abdullah Khaled al - Harbi -LRB- 18 years old -RRB- , and his friend were murdered on the first day of Eidul Adha 1423 H .
3 young men were accused of killing both , and were investigated .
Incriminating evidence was found despite denials by two of them and a confession to the crime by the third , according to the report prepared by colleague Safr Al - Azman and published by the Saudi paper " Al - watan " .
The girl said that the idea of the tape was born following failure to obtain response to her demands that the investigation proceedings be expedited and the accused tried .
She indicated that she had been working on the tape for about a year , writing its poems .
She also wrote stories based on the incident and backed them up with religious hymns , chosing " A Cry of Pain " as its title .
For his part , an unnamed source from the Public Investigation and Prosecutor 's Board in the Eastern Province explained that the case in question had been brought before the authorities concerned after it was returned from the Hafr Al Batin Court , indicating that the case had the attention of both the Prince of the Eastern Province and his deputy and that they were following up on it .
The source disclosed that the case against the accussed had been re-opened following the formation of another high - ranking board that includes a number of investigators from the Ministry of the Interior who were moved to Central Investigation in the town of Dammam .

Ten ways to build a flexible personality -LRB- not to be missed -RRB- .
Grinch
In the name of God the Compassionate , the Merciful .
Blessings and peace be upon the most noble of prophets and the messengers , our Lord Mohammed and on his family and all his companions .
Peace be upon you and the mercy and blessings of God .
I found a splendid subject during surfing the world of the Net .
I hope you like it .
It is called " Ten ways to build a flexible personality " .
What distinguishes us as people is the independent personality whether strong or weak , hesitant or fickle , balanced or extreme .
The building of a strong flexible personality is considered a personal journey in itself as it passes through a number of phases and stages , and is done through strengthening and building and refining .
I do not believe that one possesses a strong personality by nature , but one does possess the basics .
This is necessary because what comes later is the real basis for determining personality .
The American Psychological Association produced a guide called " The Way to Flexibility " aimed at building and reinforcing the flexible personality and training people wanting to attain such a personality easily .
Here are the most important of points for you :
1. The creation of social relationships : the establishing of good relations with members of the family or friends is considered to be a very important matter , as well as the acceptance of help and support from those who care about you because it acts to strengthen flexibility .
Many people also find that joining and entering civil and the other local groups that support the community helps them regain hope , and also helps other individuals in society .
2. Avoiding seeing crises as insurmountable problems : you might not be able to change the fact that annoying incidents happen but you can change the way you interpret them and your reaction to these incidents .
Try to see beyond the present and think that the future circumstances will be better .
Always put your confidence and your belief in a better tomorrow , this day will surely come .
3. Accept that change is part of life : you might not be able to achieve some of the aims because of certain circumstances but accept that the current situation and the fact that you can not change it may play a part in your acceptance of reality and pay attention to other projects in life .
Do not stand and cry over the ruins .
4. Move towards your goals , develop some realistic goals .
Do things systematically - even if it seems like small achievements , they are nevertheless some sort of steps on the way forward .
Instead of concentrating on tasks which seem unachievable , ask yourself : " What can I achieve today ? "
5. Take decisive steps : take decisive steps instead of withdrawing completely from problems and pressures and fleeing from them .
Decisive decisions will cut the doubt with confidence , strengthen your determination and make you tougher in dealing with the consequences and in benefiting from mistakes .
6. Look for opportunities to discover yourself : people are always discovering new things about themselves , they realize that they have matured in some way or other as a result of their previous experiences .
Most of the time people who have gone through harsh experiences say that they have gained from their experiences and have become better people , their personality has grown stronger and their feelings have grown stronger as well as their confidence in themselves .
7. Nurture the positive point of view in yourself : we are not asking you to become over - confident in yourself , proud and arrogant towards others , but that you become confident in your abilities to work and achieve .
Do not blame yourself too much because you will collapse at the slightest problem .
Keep things in perspective : even when you face very painful events , try to consider them an exhausting phase in the course of life , and that life is bigger and wider than this problem .
Avoid exaggerating events and problems , keep things in perspective so as to be able to overcome them easily .
Keep an optimistic frame of mind : even if the room for hope has faded in the eyes of many and you too , keep a positive frame of mind vis-à-vis the future , try to imagine what you want and not the problems that will hit you .
Take care of yourself : pay attention to your own needs and your feelings .
Take part in activities which you enjoy and in which you relax .
Practice sport regularly to obtain the physical benefit , maintain your mind and your nutrition and your health to guarantee that you reach the highest levels of personal flexibility .
The beloved Prophet , the best of blessings and peace be upon Him , said " Your self has a claim upon you . "
May God grant you success .

Bengalis Rape Minor Sudanese Girls
The Truthful Dawn
A group of Bengali soldiers participating in the United Nations forces in southern Sudan raped several minor girls .
This news was published by a British newspaper months before it was published in a Saudi newspaper : A Bengali guard at a mosque raped a Saudi child in addition to dozens of crimes which are committed by Bengali workers in Saudi Arabia .
These people are really strange .

Urgent : An Overt and Direct Message of Threat to Saudi Arabia and Saudi Arabia Replies ..!!
Al - Fahlawi
Al - Arabiya :
Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki considers the execution of Saddam as an internal matter and threatens to reexamine relations with any country that refuses to respect the will of the Iraqis in carrying out the execution on the holiday .
_________________________
I remembered after this news the saying of the fly to the mountain : Hold on well because I intend to fly .
Really the worst misfortune is that which calls for laughter ..
As if I know , you are complaining about the headline of the subject which contains resounding words such as " urgent " and " threat . " !!
In fact I do not blame you because that government which is called the Iraqi government does not reach the level of attracting the attention of the Arabs . And because its positions are known beforehand -LRB- acting as an agent .. filthiness .. vulgarity of words .. political ignorance ... etc. -RRB-
The evidence of that is that the Saudi Crown Prince replied to this dirty message before its declaration . Since he declared yesterday that Saudi Arabia will not interfere in the affairs of Iraq and encourages its sons to reunite .
______________
What quasi-men is Iraq afflicted with ?
What dirty agents are those who turn the rudder of governance in Iraq ?
Let this quasi-man called Nouri al - Maliki know that when troubles come , after God , Saudi Arabia and Egypt are the impregnable dam for everyone in whose heart throbs an atom of faith and manliness and Arabism .

Nouri al - Maliki 's situation will be like that of Ibn al - Alqami after his great treason in the murder of the Caliph of the Muslims al - Mustasim .

Your government does not honor any Arab state by having relations with it ...
The day will come when you will be gone as a result of this deed of yours .
As for the relations with the Arab states and your government under the shadow of occupation , let them be gone unmourned , you subordinate Safavid executioner ...
By the will of God , your government agent will soon not exist in the land of Mesopotamia ...

Leader of the great legions
I have never in my life seen a president of a country more stupid than the president of the United States ..
A stupid president in every meaning of the word ...
He dragged his country and the Arab region into a quagmire ... and stupidly gave Iraq to Iran in such a way that would make a reasonable person think that there was a secret agreement between Bush and Iran to deliver Iraq .
I am telling al - Maliki and the other henchmen of Bush .... not to overstep his status ...
He is just a weak and powerless person ...
His country is being run by the mullahs of Iran and he is just a trivial toy in the hand of Muqtada al - Sadr and al - Khomeini ... like it or not , despite Bush ...
The evidence is the trial of Saddam which God exposed to everyone , Arabs , non-Arabs , and Westerners ....
I really see destruction and evil spreading , encompassing Iraq .
We are on the verge of destruction and ruin , very close in Iraq , incomparable to what happened to it in previous years ...
Rather , Iraq will be a theater of major war operations which may be nuclear , burning the green and the dry , and turning Baghdad into the remains of a city inhabited by crows and the riding animals of the graves .
I call upon my Sunni brothers to leave and avoid the fire of civil strife with the impure Shiites .
May God fight them until God accomplishes with them what happened to the Rafidites and Shiites of Satan , and with His might may He use the transgressors to destroy the transgressors .
Thanks to al - Fahlawi ....
I enjoyed the simplicity of exposition and how close the words were to the heart and mind ...
Many happy returns each year .
On behalf of the leadership of the great legions ....

What 's happening now reminds me of the film Fahrenheit 9/11 by the director Michael Moore which revealed the real personality of the cowboy and spoiled child of the Bush family , George W. Bush , on behalf of the leadership of the great legions ....

Sorry brother -LRB- al - Fahlawi -RRB- .. I was late in entering a comment ,,
We tell al - Maliki .. The execution of Saddam is not an internal matter ..
Those who overthrew his regime and arrested him are the armies of the coalition , and not the army of the government of al - Hakim and Muqtada .
Thus the debate on the issue of his execution and his trial should have been an international matter for which an international court was formed ..
Even the moderates among the American politicians have stated so ..
Anyway .. al - Maliki .. knows the disgraceful situation over which he presides ..
After his ratification of the implementation of Saddam 's death sentence .. he sensed the danger and fear of what he had done , which al - Hakim and Muqtada had involved him in , and behind them the Safavids .
In a press interview conducted with him immediately after the ratification , he expressed the wish that his tenure would end soon and that he would not accept renewal .
The bitter truth is that .. this government came through a forged legitimate way .. whose mask will be revealed in the near future ..
God is the one from whom help is sought ..
Above all those who have knowledge is the All - Knowing ..
Al - Fahlawi
Al - Asha :
May you be safe and healthy every year , my eminent brother ..
You are really truthful , my brother al - Asha , but I wish they knew ..
There is much evidence against the Rafidites in particular ..
Perhaps the most important of them is the " Shah of Iran " and how he " spoiled " after they ate his flesh and threw away his bones ..
God , hasten the destruction of America and its agents ..
Thank you brother al - Asha and I was happy to see you and your participation

A New Scandal : The Lebanese Hezbollah .. Buying People and Exploiting Their Needs .
My head is raised
Although snakes may be soft to the touch , ...... when turned over they have harmful fangs .
Some were astonished by the number of people who are staging strikes in Lebanon and who oppose the legitimate government of al - Siniora , and who considered this as mobilization on the part of Hezbollah and its supporters and a confirmation of the strength of this organization .
But the truth is completely different from that , since the majority of strikers are jobless and they have found in these strikes something that provides them with money , shelter , and food . Especially after it became clear that these strikers are paid money by Hezbollah .
Each striker is paid $ 20 a day .
Imagine a Lebanese family on strike .
There are five members , for example , so they will get $ 100 a day , which is a large sum for them that they would not get under any circumstances , except through this strike which they wish would last forever .
Hezbollah buys these people and exploits their needs to achieve a goal and political aims ..
It is noticed that the officials in Hezbollah prevent any stranger from entering the places of the strikes or trying to get in touch or talk with some of the strikers for fear of revealing these secrets .
The senator ..
Nothing new my brother as implied by the title of the subject , because Hezbo Allat trades at the expense of the Lebanese .
And the most important thing on its agenda is to take over the reins of power to continue the march of its service to Iran .
I am Muslim
Hahahahahahaahahhahahahahahhahahahahahahahahhahahah . hahahahahahahahaha
And you -- how did you find out the secret , you dangerous person ? Zzzzz
And not the Mossad , sheikh .
The senator ..
The habit of Shiites is lying and trickery , and deceit .
My head is raised
My brother the senator . Yes , this is the truth .
Hezbollah is trading in the Lebanese people to serve its aims and the aims of those who stand behind it .. the interests of the party today are with Iran and Syria , and here it is serving them with all its strength ...
Accept my respect .
My head is raised
My brother . The facts are clear and do not need further explanations .
Last week I was in -LRB- Beirut -RRB- on a special visit .
I have relationships with many Lebanese -LRB- Sunnis and Shiites -RRB- and I saw what is happening on the ground of reality .
The thing is no secret , and any visitor who is eager to know these facts can reach them .
I'll mention to you a report written by an American writer who speaks about some of these issues , particularly the attempt of Hezbollah to obscure the facts related to the strikes and prevent their disclosure .
My regards to you .

How cheap by God !

Brother , my head is raised .
Peace to you and God 's mercy and blessings .
Yes , we have heard such talk more than once , in addition to the sums of money they are being provided with clothes .
They try to recruit them from the areas of the south known for extreme poverty .
All these expenses are paid by the Iranian government which is trying to control the region , whether in Iraq or Syria or Lebanon .
This is a new scandal for this party which is exploiting the needs of the people to implement its plans .
And peace to you .

Oh God the Protector -LRB- Hell in an Egyptian Village and Gas Bottles Flying Around -RRB-
Hani Ghazal
Hell in the village of Maniat Samanoud .
A gas bottle vehicle exploded and turned the town into a mass of fire .
Sahar died from a heart attack , and the officials moved six hours after the accident .
.
The vehicle totally burned , and behind it the bottles .
Reporting : Mohamed Badra
At three - thirty in the morning , the residents of Maniat Samanoud village came out to sounds of tremendous explosions , as if a battle of a war had been launched .
They were surprised by the gas bottles flying in the sky and falling over nearby houses , which led to fires and cracks in the houses from the power of the explosion .
Sahar Mohamed Al Baqtarsi - 35 years old - died , suffering a sudden heart attack from the horrendousness of the surprise .
Al Wafd met with a number of residents .
The accountant , Ibrahim Abu Seif , says that the village warehouse bottle vehicle was coming , loaded by one of the gas companies in Samnoud city .
Village residents were surprised as it entered from the side of the bridge when fire came out from the back of the vehicle .
They informed the driver and asked him to take the vehicle outside the residential block and leave it before any explosion could happen .
The driver sped up , but he noticed the intensity of the fire in the back of the vehicle .
So he stopped the vehicle in front of traffic at the end of the residential block , in front of some houses and the mixed Nasser Preliminary school .
He left it there , fearing it would explode while he was inside .
Immediately after he left it , the explosions started , and the residents came out with the sound of loud explosions .
Everybody trotted outside their houses to Samanoud city , fearing another disaster .
" The village residents went out before dawn to the sound of explosions and learned that the bottle vehicle of the village bottle warehouse was on fire and that there were bottles in it .
The bottles started to fly over the nearby houses , which caused cracks in the houses , " said Ihab Abu Shehata .
Abd Al Hamid Jaber Abu Ghoneim , the owner of a grocery booth , says several flaming bottles fell over the booth , set it on fire , and totally destroyed it .
Mahmoud Mahmoud Al Belehi , the owner of a house close to the fire , confirms that the house was cracked when a charge of bottles entered the house and a fire started in it , cracking the ceiling and walls .
Sahar Kamal was the owner of the house facing the fire , which was totally destroyed , because more than one flaming bottle fell on the two - story house , one apartment on the first floor and two apartments on the second floor , and caused a fire that destroyed all the contents of the house .
She became homeless .
One of the charges hit the village water tank , in spite of the tank 's height .
The village residents also confirmed that none of the executive agencies moved , although the residents called the Aga City Council .
No one moved .
They stayed asleep until the morning , 4 or 5 hours after the explosions , fires , and the disaster ended .

May God have mercy on those who died .
We ask God the Glorious for a quick recovery for the injured .

Hey , folks in Al - Qasim , is the news I heard true ?
Honestly , I did not believe it .
Nasri
I was talking to a young man from al - Qasim this afternoon on the Messenger ,
and he gave me this news that hit me like a bolt of lightening .
He said : there is a women 's coffee shop in Barida , and he gave me its name - " Jothun " .
What 's going on , folks ?
A women 's coffee shop , and where ! In Barida !
Anyways , I did not believe it .
I sat down in the evening to read a book , but I could n't .
" A women 's coffee shop in Barida " just locked into my mind .
as if I could feel the sights of the Barida people on that coffee shop -LRB- with a disco -RRB- I sat imagining that coffee shop .
As soon as you think of that coffee shop , the modern means of doing something sinful comes to your mind -LRB- text messages -RRB- , sealed with the words -LRB- sin and spread it -RRB- .
I sat imagining that coffee shop in its place
I imagined the organization surrounding it ,
I imagined the bearded ones speaking about women who came to sip cappuccinos ,
Drinking that coffee is forbidden by its very name , as everything that is unknown is forbidden .
You will not find " mocca " you will find the Al - Rasini blend .
By God , please , -LRB- a male reciter of the Koran who blends coffee -RRB- , I mean , a male coffee blend .
What will they offer there ?
Will it be the Qasimi kalija fresh from the bakery to the table ?
Will fatit take the place of gateau and tiramisu ?
We will not find croissants , to be replaced by the same letter -LRB- " carath " -LSB- = leek -RSB- and hot bread -RRB- ,
Will a bunch of be-socked and be-gloved ladies storm that place to report back to their husbands what is happening there ?
Will they volunteer to spread revivalist consciousness among the women -LRB- take your copy -RRB- made up of a bag containing books of horror stories + gloves + socks + the Virtues of Staying Home tape or the tape on Forbidden Acts in Shopping Malls ,
And so you will not smell the scent of perfume there , perhaps the fragrance of agarwood and frankincense , and maybe henna , the make - up of the women from the revivalist movement
and given the hallucinations of the revivalist women about the Evil Eye , there is no objection to a young girl doing the rounds with a cup into which all present will spit because a girl who visited the place yesterday evening had developed a headache and minds veered towards the illness of the revivalist women -LRB- the Evil Eye -RRB-
Aaaaahhh , how I wish to be standing now in that place

He presents the liberals ' annoying and distressing subjects , then searches in Google to see who copied a subject and who spoke about it ...
The most important thing for him is to become famous ... even at the expense of his honor , if he has any

Our sister Hissa Machiavelli It seems that your aspirations are in conflict with your desires just as the first part of your handle cancels its last out .
The disadvantaged wishes and the strong acts , and you have disadvantaged yourself to satisfy others .
However , your contradictory handle has enabled me to invent myself a contradictory handle and call it The Unfaithful Divorcee .
It is shameful to decide that our desires are the correct act , and that they are the ideal for life .
Perhaps this is as a result of a concealed pride , but why do you judge the acts of others as sick and yours as perfect ?
The same rationale that allows you to judge the acts of others has allowed us to judge you !!
My brother Misu It seems that your insults are of two kinds : one encoded and the other decoded .

Stay away from the sophisms of the Black Bat and read the opinion of Salman Al - Ouda on Saddam Hussein .
The Arabized Arabs
The well - known Sheikh Salman Al - Oadah in his fair talk about Saddam Hussein , his trial and execution in such a brutal manner , crossed the t's and dotted the i's . and put an end to the argument regarding the deeds of this man
Here is what the Sheikh said as quoted from his website Islam Today : --
Then His Excellency was asked about the execution of the former Iraqi president , Saddam Hussein
He responded that " he was greatly sympathized with by the Arabs and Moslems as his execution came at an outstanding time .
If it had been asked to chosen a time , he would not have found a better and more outstanding one than this one .
and he said that he was a Sunni Moslem from the community of Moslems and that he prounounced the Testimony of Truth at the last moment of his life .
So may God have mercy on him and may God 's forgive us and him .
As it is said in the Hadith , whose last words in this world were ' There is no God but God ' will enter paradise .
He also quoted the hadith of Ibn Masud in Sahih al - Bukhari : " a man amongst you may do evil deeds till there is only a cubit between him and the Hell Fire , and then what has been written for him decides his behavior , and he starts doing deeds characteristic of the people of Paradise . " .
Then he added that Saddam was not tried by a legal or Sharia court but by a sectarian court .

By God , it is with subjects such as these that you lose more than you gain .
" Thought is integrity and pompous rhetorical writing is vanity , so chose which ever you want "
The Revivalist Youth
......
The title is very bad
Salman Al - Oadah made a general statement that even the Black Bat himself agreed with .
But when the talk is about Saddam Hussein himself and his deeds - or rather say his crimes - no two people differ about him deserving liquidation and execution .
But we have to contemplate the way in which he was tried and the mechanism for carrying out the sentence and the interfering and controlling Rafida hand in this aspect so that he was only tried for his case against the Shia .
I acknowledge his manliness , his steadfastness and his courage in going to the gallows and his response to those around him .
I rejoiced greatly that he ended his life with stating the creed , but that does n't make me consider him a martyred hero , and his history bears witness to tyranny and injustice !!!

The opinions of Al - Oadah 's or the Bat about the crimes Saddam committed during his life do not concern me .
What concerns me is this enormous difference in the etiquette of the two men when talking about a man who has died and arrived at the afterlife ..
See how polite Sheikh Salman is in his talk about Saddam following his execution ? And how he refrained from disparaging a man who ended his life bearing witness that there is no God but God , and how he left his judgement to God and quoted al - Bukhari then concluded his talk by praying for him for mercy and forgiveness ?
Compare those polite words arising from a heart beating with piety and righteousness and faith and the harsh statements of the Bat about Saddam after his death on which he kept insisting and whose arrogance prevented him from confessing to the repulsive and perilous error to which his arrogance and conceit had led him ..
Here is revealed the difference between the scholars and the clowns

Scandal of Hiring Wailing Female Cheerleaders : Would They Have Made Them Brunettes ?
Fayiz al - Humaidi
Anyone who is acquainted with soccer is aware that cheering is not necessarily by the cheerleaders belonging to a team or a national team .
You can provide a group of mercenaries ? To spread enthusiasm among the players ?
I remember that few years ago the national team of Saudi Arabia was participating in an Asian championship held in an East - Asian country -- I think it was Thailand !
The grandstand of Saudi Arabia was crowded with Thai girls , maybe some of them were Saudi !
As a result of the attacks of young men and some old men in the past !! Throughout the match they were repeating the phrase " Saudi hah hah , Saudi hah hah , " and they would not stop repeating it until the lights of the stadium were turned off !!
Today cheering has become a profitable job .
The professional cheerleader may be paid a higher salary than the player .
I recall a Saudi club entered into contract with a cheerleader of a competitor team !!
His job was only to repeat the name of the club in a loud voice throughout the match !?
In the Gulf championship which is held in Abu Dhabi , wailing female cheerleaders were hired to support the Saudi Arabia national team !!
This was also done in all foreign championships in which the team participated .
Because we are a conservative nation that does not accept mingling between the two sexes , women and everyone like them were in another grandstand -- not the one for the cheerleader group -- so that nothing with non-praiseworthy consequences might occur !!
The scandal is that the person who chose them did not take into consideration the disparity in specifications ?
We were shown girls who were dressed in a revealing way , bending and drawing people 's attention , blondes with green eyes .
With my own eyes , I saw one of them with the lower part of her abdomen revealed out of increased enthusiasm !!
And the funny thing is that some of them tied the kaffiyeh on their heads !!
Maybe prior to that they were in the Yemeni team grandstand , before they moved to the Saudi team grandstand .
What makes one weep is that the flag of monotheism which King Abdul Aziz carried in the fields of jihad and with which he unified the country is wrapped around the waist of one of them swaying with it !!
This degradation of the flag of monotheism is a continuation of the act done by some silly people when they hung it in the house of prostitution and vice !!
The wall posters of the kingdom of dinosaurs did not believe the news and they started publishing color pictures of the charming cheerleaders on the pages of their newspapers -- on the front page !! Announcing the good news of a good era !!
The scandal sheet Shams , the adolescent dinosaur , did the most , and it was happier than others .
What made me laugh about it was nothing but a piece of news saying . " A number of photographers working for a number of Saudi publications received harshly worded threats from their wives if they disapproved of taking photos of the sweet sex at the championship . "
The truth is that most of the newspapers stopped saying that the girls supporting the Saudi team are Saudis , since the features and complexions of those girls are not in keeping with the Saudi climate !?
But Jasir al - Jasir , the writer for the newspaper Shams , refused to do anything other than make fools out of us by insisting that they are Saudis .
If he was asked to swear , he would not hesitate because of a need in his sick soul .
He undoubtedly knows that they are hired .
He says -LRB- may God guide him -RRB- : " The Saudi woman is no longer ashamed of herself , or perhaps more correctly she has been freed from her fear after the shrinking of the spheres of punishment , so it became common for her to show up in the grandstands in the stadiums to cheer for her country 's team . "
Then with the utmost stupidity , insolence , and ridicule he says : " By the way , painting the whole face constitutes a kind of veil " .
What confused that poor man is that this audience has so far not stirred up the expected storm !!
The most amazing thing is that Jasir claims that the adversaries of al - Qusaybi have thwarted his conservative project for women 's work , and today al - Qusaybi states that businessmen are the cause of the project 's delay !!
So who is lying ?
Al - Qusaybi 's conservative project for women 's work has made a decision which decreases the rate of Saudization in women 's workshops !
That sick Jasir is lying and he knows he is lying , yet he lies !
And he insists with utmost foolishness that the female cheerleaders are Saudi !!
Not only that , but he claims that they traveled to Abu Dhabi to attend the matches of the national team !!
Using a funny expression he says : " The difficulty is that no one can prevent women from traveling to Abu Dhabi , so there is nothing left to do but to pray that the team loses in the worst defeat so that the flow of women will automatically stop or that the cheerleaders become afflicted with paralysis or rickets . "
He composes a bad thing , then imagines the reaction , and then he designs funny plans for disclaimer .
The goal is ridicule and ridicule alone !!
Apologies for publishing the photos because of their necessity .
Whether the female cheerleaders are Saudis or not is not important to us .
Thankfully , they are few .
We have 8441000 women who are all good , keep their religion , morals , and their veil , and they wo n't be harmed by the emergence of a group which represents no one but itself .
But what is disgraceful and shameful is to welcome such dishonorable sights , shameful clothes , unrestrained hair , and swaying , while we see girls from the UAE and Kuwait in the grandstand of their teams looking respectable and modest , with some of them covering their faces !
What burns the heart is the eagerness of some cultured people and writers to harm their country whether they are aware or unaware ?
They made fun of us in front of all the nations of the world when they spoke about Saudi women .
A British research center -LRB- STARSH -RRB- was fair to them in its annual report when it described them as the most beautiful and flirtatious women in the world , and that they are queens of the world whose demands are fulfilled without any trouble , that they are always being served , and that they do not need to work because their expenses are provided by their guardians .
May the nobles excuse me , we are asking Jasir , Will we see your wife and daughter in the grandstand of the national team ? Did you give them freedom and liberate them from their fear , and free their soul from shyness ?
Will you say what your leader said ?
My daughters will be the first to drive a car !!?
.
I am completely reassured that the liberal project will not succeed in this country , praise God .
For no matter how far the liberal ideological lunacy has affected some brain cells of the young , it will never be able to affect the part that controls the sense of honor , otherwise man would be stripped of his values and would become like an animal , a cuckold .
He wo n't enter paradise or even find its scent !
That 's why you find them the most caring and the most solicitous of their close female relatives .
You will never see in the near future a daughter or a wife or even a sister of a writer or a cultured man leading a grandstand by cheering for her team .
And she will not be the first to drive a car , and she will not work , according to al - Qusaybi 's rules , not to mention going out with her face and hair uncovered !!
They want to see the features of freedom and emancipation in women other than theirs .
How happy they will be the day they see a Saudi or part - Saudi woman in all her finery , having given up her veil and restrictions , and having freed herself from the authority of her father , her brother , and her husband .
They spread her news and praise her deed .
Maybe they will change her name by adding the definite article -LRB- al- -RRB- to emphasize her affinity and relationship to the most deeply - rooted Saudi families such as : -LRB- al - Nasr , al - Sharikh , and al - Imran . -RRB-
Spotlight : If the nation were not preoccupied with its major issues -- namely the fundamentals of its religion -- then it would occupy itself with the differences with which they will eat each other up , it will become weak , and it will appear sick to such an extent that the nation will have no more strength .

My honorable brother , how did you weigh this need to publish photos of the female cheerleaders ....?
Usually , money is wasted .. in search for money .

My noble brother , Fayiz al - Humaidi First , I say thank you for your sense of honor and concern for your countrymen .
Second , a proverb says -LRB- For every prostitute there is a customer -RRB- meaning if we want to look for a female Saudi dancer we will find one , and if we look for a female Saudi singer we will find one , and if we look for a beautiful Saudi woman we will find one .
Evil is not restricted to a certain class of people , and Satan entices people .
But because there is a little discord in Saudi society , it certainly does not represent the whole and it does not represent the opposing public opinion .
Rather , it represents itself and those who belong to it .
I say this because displaying the photos of the female cheerleaders whether they are Saudis or hired , and anything is possible , though the latter is more likely , does not make us think that all are respectable .
Of course , what we saw does not honor us Saudis -- cheering for the team in this way by rebelling against our noble values and morals ..
This is not cheering , but rather it is removing the veil for its own sake .
It was something done by those who wanted to do it .
Female Saudi cheerleaders or hirelings -LRB- anything is possible -RRB- previously cheered for the team in Kuwait , but in a more decent and better way than what is happening now .
This is a photo of Saudi female cheerleaders in Kuwait .
If we assume that someone said , " Why the twitching and condemnation about the female cheerleaders when they have done something patriotic by cheering and supporting their team ? " -LRB- This is the custom we are familiar with from Akhzam Zanim . -RRB- We would say that cheering does not at all mean renouncing virtue , and it does not mean candor and challenging values and morals .
Rather , it is possible to cheer without being exposed to that at home because the matches are broadcast .
If it were said , " But we see all the teams of the world , including the Arab teams , cheered by their citizens , males and females . " We would say , " First of all , we are Muslims who have our own beliefs and our own way of doing things which differ from those of others . We have to pay attention to them as long as we are among their people just like Hindus with their cows , Buddhists with their idols , Judaism , Christianity , and others .. "
From this perspective , we are not forced to imitate others , and no matter how we justify this as civilization and progress it is a justification from the dictionary of Satan who swore " I will beguile them all . "
To conclude : In every nation there are Banu Saad , meaning that there are good people and bad people .
What the female cheerleaders did is not accepted by their fellow citizens even if they were encouraged by those who are like them , whose hearts and minds have become secularized and whose mania became the imitation of the Semites in every big and small way .
Discuss with me and tell me your objections but do not ignore and delete what I said -LRB- No for deletion -RRB- Yes -LRB- for discussion -RRB- .
Fayiz al - Humaidi Able by God
Fayiz , really , no one replies to those ....... the likes of Jasir except people like you and Sharwak .
We hope to see your creativity in writing on other subjects .
May God make you useful for the religion and the homeland .
All love and appreciation to you .
Your brother , Abdullah al - Qarni .
Note : I am not one of those who like to correspond with authors , but really , your wonderful article compelled me to thank you .
I ask God to make you happy in this life and in the hereafter .

Brother Abdullah al - Qarni : May God reward you with good and elevate your status .
Thank you for your good thoughts about me .

Brother Fayiz .
The scandal of hiring wailing female cheerleaders : they made them brunettes .
We do not deny that there are Saudi women who go out and show us how pretty they are .
But those who appear in the photo -- only God knows whether they are Saudi women or not ?
Perhaps some of them are Saudi and some were simply hired to support the Saudi national team .
Of course the newspapers published the photos by way of another thing which is making people accustomed to the emergence of Saudi female cheerleaders .
In the past , we did not see Saudi women appear on television .
Then Saudi women gradually started to appear on Channel One , and on the news channel which originally specialized in allowing Saudi women to appear , and it became commonplace .
You find them presenting girls and women in their homes unveiled . One may be an engineer , and another may be something else . Until the appearance of Saudi women on our television channels became a very ordinary thing .
The problem now is that even women wearing the veil and who are fully covered appear on the news channel .
Take for example , today 's silly question which they primarily and continuously focus on the appearance of women and girls in interviews .
In the first place , since when do women appear as far as we are concerned ?
At first , the man was shy when he appeared .
But now we see women appear and talking boldly , exceeding the limits .
I really become shy when I see them -LSB- -RSB- on their men who let them appear on the Al - Ekhbariya channel and it is well known that this channel deliberately does this thing by encouraging the liberation of women through interviews .
I remember that once Qatar hired Moroccan women in one of its celebrations in order to play the role of Gulf girls , meaning that in each song about a Gulf state , they let girls dance . As if they were from those states , although in some of the Gulf states -- Bahrain , the Emirates , Oman and Kuwait -- their girls have appeared on television and sung and danced for a long time , except for the girls of Qatar and Saudi Arabia .
A reply to the writer ' I am the Arab . '
Again , respect yourself and do not describe .
Our society is more honorable and nobler than a nobody like you talking about it and describing it using the worst adjectives as if you are talking about the societies of the West .
It is nice to say that they are well - born Saudi women and from well - known tribes .
This is one of your lies .
Why ?
Did you see their identity cards ?
Or just to say " Look , this is the reality of your girls . "
By no means do we deny that there are unveiled Saudi women , and we do not hold our society to be free of faults and corruption .
But thank God we have more good than evil .
But your problem is that you are looking with only one eye , the eye of evil and defects .
-------------------------
Noble brother , may God reward you with good and elevate your status .
Perhaps there are Saudi women among them but the majority of them are not .
Moreover , I do not find it easy to swallow that a Saudi woman would uncover her belly , God forbid !!
Anyway , the aim of the subject is to reply to Jasir al - Jasir , this poor wretch who has shown his malice , and was among the happiest about these disgusting scenes .
-------------------------
In the name of God , the Merciful , the Compassionate .
My beloved brother .. may God reward you with good .
You really are a Saudi citizen .. you fear for your country and your society from the male and female corrupters .
May God grant success to you and to everyone else who are earnestly concerned about what He loves and approves of .
May God take revenge on those who are scheming night and day , secretly and openly , to seduce women in this conservative Muslim country which sent the Spanish minister of justice away in failure after the men stopped him when he set conditions -- and in our country which hosted him .
When he became impolite , he was halted in the most polite and reasonable way .
During this ... comes the match between our Saudi national team and the national team of our brother country Qatar ..
Like it or not , the Qatari people are the twin of the Saudi people .
Actually they are one people ...
The elite are the people of Qatar .
They have the blessings of a conservative and zealous Muslim people .. even if something else is wanted for it ..
I watched the two matches that day ...
The first match was the Iraqi national team against the Bahraini national team ...
The logo of the Iraqi team was green and white , like the Saudi team , and they were in the same grandstands , and they were the same female cheerleaders .
That is , the one who hired them - for something in his mind - brought them more than one hour before the first match of the Iraqi team against the Bahraini team , and they did not leave the stadium until after the match between Saudi Arabia and Qatar .
That is , they stayed at the stadium for at least five hours ..
I do not say that all of them were hired , but rather , perhaps there was one or two or even ten Saudi women .
But the one who rejoices when the camera passes over her and stands up and jumps and shouts is either one of two : .
The first : not a Saudi .
The second : a Saudi woman devoid of bashfulness who has not been brought up well by her parents and lived outside Saudi Arabia more than she lived inside it .
I say this because I am a Saudi and I know well the girls of my country .
No matter how reckless a Saudi girl is she has limits at which she stops ..
Those in the grandstands crossed the red , yellow and green lines .....
This is not done by Saudi actresses and singers who left the world of purity for a corrupt world which suits the life they have chosen for themselves ...
It is well known that actresses and singers are less shy than others .
Has anyone seen a singer or an actress with such shamelessness ?..
Despite their shamelessness they do not reach this degree ..
Finally , I say : -LRB- The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was established on the basis of the words of God , on the words of His messenger , and on the application of the religion of God and the Sunna of His messenger -LRB- may God bless him and grant him salvation -RRB- . This way of doing things will not change in spite of the liberals , so it is better for them to pursue al - Qusaybi , Khalid al - Harbi , and others whom purity and virtuousness do not suit , and who want to graze like cattle in every corrupt world . -RRB-
-----------------------
Noble brother : may God reward you with good and elevate your status .
The media should have disapproved of what happened in the grandstands , but unfortunately newspapers have vied with each other to publish the photos as though they were heralding a new era !
-----------------------
My outstanding brother In fact , I am displeased by your choices -- you and Aba Lujayn -- for instance ... of specific subjects .. meant apparently to promote your earnest concern which you lack in your heart -- you and him . Because you choose only the subjects which get the interest of the common people , and you stir up instincts in them to find enough drum - beating to satisfy your illusion -- you and Aba Lujayn along with several writers ..
You write for something in the soul of Yaqub and you leave the real issues which threaten Islam and Muslims .
You even avoid replying to them as if birds were on your heads ....
You have been exposed to everyone ...
This is a subject about a prince ..
And this is a subject about a disreputable cheerleader ..
And something else is about a trivial issue which is read only by a trivial person or one deluded by a false reputation about you ..
You made a sparkle for yourselves ..... and you were burned and the light burned you because you are mere darkness .
Advice for the sake of God ......
Share your nation 's real concerns ... over the dangers surrounding it from all directions .. over our enemies ... over the conspiracies woven against us in secrecy .. over encroachments on our values and our true religion .... not on disreputable prostitutes , whether they were Saudis or not ; they are vulgar whores ..
In the kingdom and in the public streets and on the televisions and satellite stations we have more than those who dress in a revealing way among our fellow citizens ...... or do you deny that as well , like your amazing selectiveness which stirs doubt .
The main point .....
This is your habit and this is your style ....
My brother , get acquainted with a prince or ask Aba Lujayn to introduce you to one of his friends the thieves .. so you and him along with the gang of merry - making can become like the economic analysts who are paid for what they say on the satellites to deceive the common people so that their masters and the providers of their livelihood may profit ......................
May God guide you .. no and after you put their picture .... go just .... peeling onions is better for you than quackery and hoodwinking , you bankrupt ... like the poor of the Jews .
------------------------------
My outstanding brother : May God guide you and lead you back to the right path .
You began your message with grace and ended it with name - calling !
There is nothing greater than sharing the concerns of the nation , than denouncing a vile deed .
What happened is among the encompassing dangers about which we must not keep silent .
It is not for promoting a sense of honor !!
At whom ?
Thank you for putting my name beside that of Abu Lujayn .
This is an honor for me that I am unworthy of .
Whoever is like Abu Lujayn has succeeded .
-------------------------------
Greetings .
You said in your subject on the site of the forum entitled " Scandal of Hiring Wailing Female Cheerleaders : Would They Have Made Them Brunettes ? " -LRB- In the Gulf championship , which is held in Abu Dhabi , wailing female cheerleaders were hired to support the national team of Saudi Arabia !
This was done at all the foreign championships in which the team participated .
Because we are a conservative nation which does not accept mingling between the two sexes , women and everyone like them were in another grandstand -- not the one for the cheerleader group -- so that nothing with non-praiseworthy consequences might occur !
The scandal is that the person who chose them did not take into consideration the disparity in specifications ?
For we were shown girls who are dressed in a revealing way , bending and drawing people 's attention , blondes with green eyes .
With my own eyes , I saw one of them with the lower part of her abdomen revealed out of increased enthusiasm !
And the funny thing is that some of them tied the kaffiyeh on their heads !
Maybe prior to that they were in the Yemeni team grandstand , before they moved to the Saudi team grandstand .
What makes one weep is that the flag of monotheism which King Abdul Aziz carried in the fields of Jihad and with which he unified the country is wrapped around the waist of one of them swaying with it !!
And this degradation of the flag of monotheism is a continuation of the act done by some silly people when they hung it in the house of prostitution and vice !! -RRB-
My brother , what does Yemen have to do with the issue now ?
Or do you think that the girls of Yemen are loose and lost ?
Think the matter over .
If you think that , you were wrong , please apologize to all Yemenis in your same subject .
You defend the girls of Saudi Arabia by insulting the girls of Yemen .
Why ?
You do n't like it for the girls of Saudi Arabia , but you like it for the girls of Yemen ?
I have been a follower of the forum site for years .
Your topic is the first one I have replied to .
Because of your replies to the participants , I respected you and I still respect you .
But the lapse was uncalled for .
May Allah forgive you in the protection of Allah .
-----------------------------
My outstanding brother : May Allah reward you with good and elevate your status .
You seem to be from Yemen !
Anyway I did not mean that that girl was from Yemen , but rather that she was hired for cheerleading .
Because she tied the kaffiyeh on her head the way the people of Yemen do , I said what I did in sarcasm , not to attack the women of Yemen !
