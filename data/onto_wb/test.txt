Michael Jackson may be another example of a celebrity distraction which , upon examination , reveals more about our society 's mortal condition than a tabloid could imagine .
Almost certainly more than it would dare to describe .
Yesterday , Jackson was ordered to close Neverland for having failed to pay the ranch 's 47 employees their salary or insurance since the end of 2005 .
Unfortunate for the unpaid staff and the abandoned llamas but no surprise .
He 's moved on since his aquittal , like Gary Glitter did after his 1999 conviction , having departed last June for a Bahrain `` vacation '' from which he 's yet to emerge .
-LRB- '' For the people working at Bahrain 's malls , the person covered head to toe in a black veil , gloves and glasses appeared to be a rich , doting Saudi mother ....
But why would a woman wear a man 's shoes ?
Why the bodyguards ?
And why did the person 's fluid movements seem so familiar ? '' -RRB-
Last week 's real Jackson story ran in the New York Daily News , under the snappy banner `` Creepy dad was root of all clan 's woe , singer sez . ''
The singer was brother Jermaine , and the claims based on the projected outline for his abandoned `` tell - all '' family story .
Reading that Joseph was a nightmare of a father and sexually abusive towards his daughters is not exactly a `` stop the presses '' moment .
What 's new is this :
Jermaine even suggested his father may have set up Michael to be somehow victimized by older men .
He tells how his father would have Michael join in at late - night hotel room meetings with `` important business people , '' and wondered whether `` something happened '' to Michael at those sessions .
He said he sensed something was wrong because Michael would be sick for days after .
`` What was Joseph doing ? '' Jermaine wrote .
This lifts the Jackson family horror show to a whole new order of dysfunction , one that sees parents network with power and trade their children for privilege .
This should be a motif familiar to anyone acquainted with the literature of mind control and ritual abuse survivors : the father and first controller , passing his child - victim up the social ladder of abuse in return for status , protection and reward .
All that 's missing is the element of occult terror .
Or maybe not : `` LaToya also described being awakened in the night by Joseph wearing a ' monster mask . ' ''
Perhaps we can take more from this than the suspicion that the Jackson clan had gotten with the program .
Perhaps rather the point is that the program exploits pre-existing conditions for abuse which are more common than most suspect .
-LRB- This is how I tend to think of Ponchatoula 's Hosanna Church . -RRB-
Yet we should n't discount the suspicion , either , particularly given some of Michael 's paranormal interests and peculiar associations .
His close friendship with SPECTRA contactee and channeller of the Nine , Uri Geller , for one instance .
-LRB- Jackson was Geller 's best man in 2001 when he and his wife renewed his vows , the same year Geller is said to have been reactivated as a psychic spy . -RRB-
His entourage including a `` personal magician '' for another .
Even if you wanted to , you wo n't be reading Jermaine 's account now .
Like every Jackson sibling who 's tried to break from Joe , he 's climbed down , returned to the fold and scrapped the book , apparently on the strength of Michael 's threats to sue .
Previously , Michael 's given cause for family observers to attribute his grotesque body dysmorphia to a dread of resembling his father .
Yet there they were at Jackson 's trial last year , hand in hand .
In the big picture Michael Jackson means not very much .
But his little picture may be more newsworthy than the news suggests .
good stuff .
having departed last June for a Bahrain `` vacation '' from which he 's yet to emerge .
Actually , there have been reports for the past two days of Jackson back in California .
#NAME ?
Wild wild stuff Jeff !
Disinformation Distraction Dis and Dat ..
The netwerk is as sacred to the state as their mantra `` My way or total annihilation . ''
Bait and switch sets the agenda .
There is no such thing as an accident .
It 's Saturday morning , and the papers say a moon of Saturn is spewing life - giving water .... then I see the new R.I. post is about the perrenial child Michael Jackson .
This day is named for Saturn ...
" ... it was foretold that one day a mighty son of Saturn would in turn overthrow him ,
and Saturn devoured all of his children when they were born to prevent this ... ''
Apparently Saturn is also intimately connected with Satan , Masonics , and Revelation 13 - you know , the `` number of the beast '' ...
Nevermind -
I need a cup of coffee ...
I looked in vain for the Cheney `` A hunting we will go '' to post this out and paste but ...
And on the subject of cowardice , consider this . In a recent hunting escapade , Dick Cheney accidentally shot one of his hunting comrades .
There may have been negligence involved , but that is up to the local district attorney to decide .
But more importantly , I think , is the nature of the hunt .
These were not wild birds .
The birds were bred in captivity .
They had spent their lives in pens , and then on hunting day , were released for the sole purpose of being killed by Dick Cheney and cohorts for pure sport as they flew into the open sky for their only moments of brief freedom .
Whether you are an animal lover or not , there is something disgusting and degrading about this kind of hunt and something less than human about those who participate in it .
The link `` personal majician '' is intrigueing .
From Madsen via Boucher :
Jackson 's stay at the Cedars was arranged through David Kuo , George W. Bush 's White House director of the Office of Faith - based Initiatives .
Kuo , a former CIA employee ... had been Executive Director of the Center for Effective Compassion , founded in 1995 by Arianna Huffington ...
Kuo also previously worked for the Christian Coalition and Senator John Ashcroft .
There 's also some curious Neverland / Disneyland connections to the `` Mickey Mouse Club '' children who are now stars , including Justin Timberlake -LRB- remember the star on Janet Jackson 's breast ? -RRB- and Brittany Spears , Christina Aguilera ...
The piper walks into the mountain , still followed by the children , and the cave closes again ...
Here is Boucher 's follow up to the `` majician '' link of Jeff 's .
on the mark as always , jeff ,
but i thought you might cover chile 's inauguration of its first woman president today instead ...
maybe later as the story develops ?
Jeff Boucher 's piece mentions how victims of sexual abuse often have childlike voices , almost as if their development was ' frozen ' around the time of their abuse .
Jackson seems to be of this type .
Or more perversely , fakes that he is :
`` I was always saying -LSB- to Jackson -RSB- people would n't think I was so crazy if they saw who the hell you really are , that you sit around , and you drink and you curse and you 're -LSB- expletive -RSB- funny and you have a bad mouth , and you do n't have that high voice all the time '' -
Lisa Marie Presley , in an interview quoted in a WaPo article written by Tina Brown :
Michael Jackson 's False Front ?
`` David Geffen , be gone !
Steven Spielberg , be gone ! ''
The witch doctor cursing Michael Jackson 's enemies and blessing the tarnished King of Pop himself in a voodoo ritual in Switzerland in the summer of 2000 had promised that the 25 people on Jackson 's enemies list -LRB- would soon be dead -RRB- ...
Jackson had ordered his then business adviser , Myung - Ho Lee , a U.S. - educated Korean lawyer based in Seoul , to wire $ 150,000 to a bank in Mali for a voodoo chief named Baba , who then had 42 cows ritually sacrificed for the ceremony .
Jackson had already undergone a blood bath ...
The pop star , who is said to be $ 240 million in debt , had paid six figures for a ritual cleansing using sheep blood to another voodoo doctor and a mysterious Egyptian woman named Samia , who came to him with a letter of greeting from a high - ranking Saudi prince , purportedly Nawaf Bin Abdulaziz Al - Saud , now the chief of intelligence of Saudi Arabia ...
http://www.vanityfair.com/commentary/content/articles/050411roco03c hmm .
According to that Vanity Fair article , Jacko and Uri Geller met through `` that other fellow devotee of children 's charities Mohamed Fayed , the chairman of Harrods in London , who believes that the C.I.A. and Prince Philip had Princess Diana and his son , Dodi , killed . ''
Anonymous quoted , `` Jackson 's stay at the Cedars was arranged through David Kuo ... ''
Hold on --
the Cedars is the headquarters of the Fellowship Foundation , the creepy Christianoid cult with deep political connections .
Here 's a bit of the original Madsen article that the Michael Jackson quote comes from :
In 1976 , the Fellowship began looking for a permanent headquarters in Arlington .
It set its sights on the estate of George Mason IV , The Cedars , located at 2301 North Uhle Street .
Mason was one of the drafters of the Bill of Rights .
The Fellowship , also known as the International Foundation , bought the property from Charles Piluso .
Although not much is known about Piluso , the Los Angeles Times reported that Howard Hughes , the man with whom Fellowship Senator Ralph Owen Brewster once sparred , also lived there .
According to a senior Pentagon official , the Cedars had been used as a CIA safe house prior to the Fellowship 's purchase of the estate .
The Fellowship paid $ 1.5 million for the Cedars , the money coming from Tom Phillips , the CEO of Raytheon , and Ken Olsen , the CEO of Digital Equipment Corporation .
Sanford McDonnell of McDonnell Douglas Corporation was another deep - pocketed supporter of the Fellowship through Full Gospel Business Men 's Fellowship International , an activity linked to Fellowship core member Pat Robertson .
Suffer the little children , eh ?
If this is what power & wealth does to you , I 'm damn glad I have neither .
You said , `` Perhaps rather the point is that the program exploits pre-existing conditions for abuse which are more common than most suspect . ''
Could n't agree more .
I think that pedophilia 's relative commonality is what really makes it frightening .
My experience happened when I was 15 .
A friend of mine met this guy who was twice our age & who was more than willing to buy us all the whiskey we could drink .
We were both enamored with Kerouac & Jim Morrison & meeting strange characters & this guy definitely fit the bill .
He was muscle for a Pittsburgh madam named Tex Gill .
She dressed like a man & ran most of the massage parlors in Pgh .
He was into black magick & Crowley & booze & drugs & on & on .
So , one night , we 're at his apartment , drunk out of our minds ,
& my buddy passes out .
I continue drinking .
At one point , I glance at this older guy ,
& he is staring at my buddy as a line of drool runs down the cigarette in his mouth & drips on to the floor .
I think , ' What the fuck ? '
but I 'm pretty goddamn wasted
& reality is having a helluva time penetrating the fog in my head .
He notices that I 'm kind of staring at him .
He stands up , walks into the bedroom , & comes back with a porno mag .
He drops it on the couch next to me .
As he 's sitting down , he says , `` See anything you like ? ''
& then he shoves his hand hard into my groin .....
.... & I broke his nose with my elbow .
Make no mistake though , up till that point , the guy scared the shit out of me .
But , lucky for me , my reaction was see red anger instead of cowering fear .
After i hit him , I jumped up , ran into his kitchen & grabbed a big old butcher knife , ran back into the room & proceeded to kick my buddy into consciousness & drag his comatose ass the hell out of there .
Now , for me , the interesting part happened years later .
At the time , my buddy & I were selling things .
My buddy had a real good supplier for these things but it was his secret .
At one point , my buddy could n't pick up the shipment so I had to go .
Before I left , he had to explain to me that his supplier was none other than Freddie Feelup .
I decided to go .
He was now closer to 40 & just a hollow shell of his former self .
Friendless , his only company being neighborhood teens looking to party .
He kept one room empty except for 4 black candles in each of its corners .
he would read curses aimed at people who pissed him off .
Really pathetic .
About a year later , a few of those teens took an intense dislike to Freddie & the beat him to to death .
I ca n't imagine why .
Can you ?
I apologize for continuing my ramble but ... ,
... I do n't know how you folks would classify pedophilia .
Maybe a 30 year old man & a 15 year old boy does n't qualify .
I wonder about that myself , but I have to say that when I was 30 , I was n't plying 15 year old girls with booze & copping feels .
I 'll shut up now .
Speaking of Pat Robertson -
I remembered something about him being linked with Victor Bout and the UAE two - step currently going on :
Bout was Liberian dictator Charles Taylor 's primary arms and diamond smuggler ...
Taylor , who is now in exile in Nigeria , was a business partner with Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson ... in a Cayman Islands front company called Freedom Gold , Ltd .
In fact , Freedom Gold was headquartered at Robertson 's CBN offices in Virginia Beach , Virginia .
Robertson 's African interests also crossed paths with Bout 's in another country -- the former Zaire .
Robertson 's African Development Company used the cover of Robertson 's tax - exempt `` Operation Blessing '' to ferry conflict diamonds out of civil war - ravaged Zaire -LRB- now Congo -RRB- .
One of Bout 's many assets is New Millennium Air Company of Gambia .
The Director of this firm is `` Baba Jobe '' .
-LRB- hmmm -
`` Baba '' ... -RRB-

My question is , when is a victim guilty of abuse ?
Jackson is definitely a mind - control , SRA victim .
He 's programmed .
Neverland sounds like a cryptic command from MKULTRA Wizard of Oz programming .
The bizarre from black - to - white and physical transformation must be the result of biotech advances .
If he does abuse ' his ' children , is he ' guilty ' as such if he is programmed ?
I suspect he is a brilliant cover or red - herring used as a shield by very powerful forces , responsible for God - knows - what at his now - abandoned ranch .
It 's very effective , as many ' feel ' that whilst MJ is naive he 's not capable of the evil associated with pedophile activity .
This may not be the case , as the public ' persona ' is merely an ' alter ' personality and he may have many other ' personalities ' which are dark .
Then comes the question whether his programmers were programmed themselves .
If so , then they are all guilty of such abuse , whilst being innocent at the same time !
As most abuse is generational , the whole mind - control subject really has to be brought out in the open .
The very technology and tools used on the mind which harm can then be used to heal .
Brr , Pied Piper .
I remember being spooked by that story as a kid .
Heck of a story to tell children .
Talking about strange coincidences ... I was trying to write a science fiction story a while back involving Star Gate type research .
I was looking for a cool name for an undercover X-Files type military - occult agency .
Thought of ' SPECTRE ' but that seemed too James Bondish , and modified it to ' SPECTRA ' .
Thinking rainbow - type symbology .
Then I find out that ' SPECTRA ' is actually a name with significance in the community .
What the ...
... of course , I did read a lot of weird stuff in passing as a kid ,
it 's certainly possible that I came across it and forgot .
I was n't consciously aware of it , certainly .
It 's the most disappointingly *cheesy* 1960s sci - fi kind of name for an astral entity to use , that 's for sure .
I never did write that story .
Is n't Michael Jackson , and the entire Jackson clan , Jehovah 's Witness ?
There was no mention made of this in either the main post or comments ....
It would seem to me that their must be some relationship between that cult organization and all the `` high weirdness '' going on ....
no ?
.... and it is a cult .
FBI finally releases report on missing children .

I 'm surprised I have n't heard this mentioned anywhere before , as it ties in perfectly with Jeff 's Bizarro Jacko Tabloid post :
In an interview with Blender -LRB- ca n't remember what issue , but Janet 's on the cover -RRB- , Janet talks at length about having mulitiple personalities .
I ca n't remember all the details , but there 's Janet , the normal pop star , and among others -LRB- and perhaps the most notable in this context -RRB- one she calls `` Strawberry , '' who is geared towards explicit sexual activities .
As I understand , this is a classic alters description .

Do n't trip
You know you wan na watch this
I 'm a pro you wo n't be disappointed
Gon na leave you beggin' for more
I 'ma make you Lose Control
Glad someone finally mentioned Janet .
I think the practice of black magic is something she and her brother have in common .
One mus n't forget her now infamous superbowl `` nipple '' stunt .
Rather than the ridiculous accident censors tried to make it out to be , I think it has to be recognized as a planned , purposeful piece of black magic , perpetraited literally in front of the world , on a very alchemically significant day and time
-LRB- goes way beyond a ' publicity stunt , does n't it ? ' -RRB-
A friend even suggests that during her much earlier ' Rythm Nation ' period , in which she dons a black uniform and uses strange , synchopated hand movements in her video dance routine , that that too , is a kind of twilight language , intended on sending a specific message , in order to have a desired effect .
It 's possible that jacksons have been using the occult arts for a long , long time .
I 'd love to hear someone else 's thoughts on this -
Here 's a link to just a wee bit more about Jackson and her alleged MPD -
http://dave.typepad.com/dave/2004/06/janet_jacksons_.html
I posted above that The Cedars , where Michael Jackson was mentioned as having stayed for a time , was the center of the Fellowship Foundation .
I just ran across the Fellowship Foundation again , when looking for something to explain the anomalous situation of recently - disgraced Republican shoplifter Claude A. Allen .
The quote below is from the LaRouchies -- and thus , as always , not to be considered 100 % reliable --
but in this case it fits in so well with the ongoing discussion that I 'm tentatively inclined to trust it :
DeLay 's career and power became at the same time a central project for all three of the shadow partners , Grover Norquist , Jack Abramoff and Ralph Reed .
DeLay was by no means a random point of interest .
Tom DeLay staggered into Washington as a freshman Congressman in 1984 , a terrible drunk , his life dissolving .
Rep. Frank Wolf -LRB- R - Va. -RRB- approached him with a road to salvation .
He reportedly showed DeLay a videotape that made him weep .
Tom DeLay then radically changed his life , turning his soul over to higher powers .
But by all reliable accounts , DeLay became a much nastier , a fearsomely un-Christian individual .
Frank Wolf represented an old `` black operations '' soul - robbing agency known as the Fellowship Foundation .
Practicing secrecy on about the same level as the National Security Agency , the Fellowship does conduct one public function --
it runs the huge annual Congressional / Presidential Prayer Breakfast in Washington , with similar events managed inside the Pentagon and at other government and military sites .
The Fellowship Foundation -LRB- earlier called International Christian Leadership and a succession of cover names -RRB- was created before World War II by the organization of the pro-Nazi Frank Buchman .
Sen. H. Alexander Smith -LRB- R - N.J. -RRB- , Buchman 's lieutenant who in 1940 had called for a joint world dictatorship of the United States , Britain , and Nazi Germany , brought the Fellowship into acceptance in Washington .
In the 1950s , the group was sponsored by former Nazi SS officer , Holland 's Prince Bernhard , and the Dutch royal family .
The Fellowship runs a house near the U.S. Capitol , where Congressmen and Senators , who are members , live .
For example , Sen. Sam Brownback -LRB- R - Kans. -RRB- , the delirious End - Timer , has lived in the cult 's house in Washington .
Raytheon CEO Tom Phillips and other figures in the military - industrial complex , pay the bills .
The Fellowship specializes in taking over the lives of potentially powerful individuals who have become somehow ruined , and promising them dominion in the world if they will play along .
Watergate dirty - trickster Charles Colson , when he was on his way to prison and suddenly powerless , was recruited , and turned his life over to the Fellowship .
Colson 's Prison Fellowship Ministries is a subordinate unit of the cult , with its tentacles in most prisons in the United States .
After Tom DeLay was zapped , Charles Colson became DeLay 's personal guru .
Colson 's militancy for the End - Times war on Muslims has made him a congenial companion to Jack Abramoff in their keeping of DeLay -- Abramoff has repeatedly led Tom to Israel to call for all - out war against the Arabs .
And Christian Coalition co-founder Pat Robertson was himself a product of the Fellowship magic .
Robertson was the good - for - nothing playboy son of Sen. A. Willis Robertson -LRB- R - Va. -RRB- , the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee .
Pat began speaking in tongues and uttering prophecies under the guidance of Harald Bredesen , a master training agent of the Fellowship group , who had proved himself to the highest circles of British intelligence .
Pat Robertson started off as assistant pastor to Bredesen , whose intelligence partners , the Full Gospel Businessmen 's Fellowship , raised the money to expand Robertson 's and Bredesen 's Virginia - based Christian Broadcasting Network -LRB- CBN -RRB- toward global power status .
The sentence I put in boldface is *extremely* interesting .
Was n't there a Michael Jackson video where he was envisioning himself as ruler of the world or some such ?
to anonymous 9:30 re cults :
`` The reason fear can arise so strongly is that you already have a very strong experience of being brainwashed and used in cultish behavior .
This cult is called society and its ' cult - ure ' gives rise to suffering .
If you look closely , everything that is associated with cult behavior can lisewise be found in society 's behavior .
The same means of control are used : the constant reinforcement that you are helpless without society , that you can not survive without obeying its rules and that you will go to hell if you do n't obey the tenets of its religion . ''

http://www.egotastic.com/entertainment/celebrities/janet-jackson/janet-jackson-is-too-fat-to-sing
Anonymous One , I recall reading somewhere that Lisa Marie was a member of L.Ron 's cult .
You will notice that Michael 's real troubles started after he suied Sony chief Tommy Mattola , who was heard to say `` he 'll live to regret the day '' .
Do n't ever think of fucken with the evil bastards in the Music biz , later .
Here 's a description of that Michael Jackson item I was remembering :
By the time the release of 1995 's HIStory album -- a double album of greatest hits and new tracks -- approached , Michael had fully realized a new perception of himself , one that was truly larger than life .
HIStory was hyped with a four - minute teaser video .
This extravagant production begins with a colossal army goose - stepping through a European city in crisp , tan uniforms , waving red flags and sporting red - and - black insignias .
Military music pounds .
Crowds swell at the sidelines , screaming and crying .
The implication seems to be these men represent Nazis .
But then , their leader is revealed to be Michael , marching right up front .
When peasant workers break free to touch Michael , they are immediately swallowed by soldiers .
Suddenly , it is night , and a tarp - covered , skyscraper - sized structure looms over the poor nation as choppers spray spotlights across it .
Brainwashed fans scream , salute with one arm and light candles with religious zeal .
Signs proclaiming `` King of Pop , '' a title Michael disavowed to Oprah only two years earlier , are everywhere , emphasizing the word `` King . ''
Finally , the tarp drops , and it is , of course , a gargantuan , bronze statue of Michael , fists clenched defiantly , his star insignia prominent , yet his face still somehow child - like and unthreatening .
The video is a highly disturbing piece of work .
His bloated sense of importance is not only chilling , it is threatening .
Suddenly , Michael 's perfect world of Oz / Neverland is forced to be compared with an Aryan Nation , one that substitutes children for Hitler 's master race .
Large image of the Michael Jackson HIStory statue .
There is some sort of an emblem with a star on his shoulder , but it 's at an angle and not easy to make out clearly .
'' ... a haughty spirit goeth before a fall . ''
BTW - and off topic :
Check out this superb psyop image .
Jeff , I do n't think even you could do better than this :

BTW Jeff - I 'd caught the Geller / Jackson connection a while back and posted on the discussion board .
Fascinating how this all seems to be inter-related .
hmmm ...
in March 2003 Jackson distraction - o - mania was part of the media smokescreen that led up the Iraq war ...
and now Fox news and other rabid - right media outlets have once again taken to whipping on Jackson ...
-LRB- like any sane people really care about what the hell MJ is doing any more . -RRB-
A signs of another impending misadventure in the mideast ?
And what 's with Uri Geller 's links to MJ ?
Anyone else smell a whiff of that whole Prophet Yahweh sideshow from awhile back ? trivial , but here 's stargods ' comprehensive analysis of jacko :
regarding the JW reference .
I do n't think we need see a plot in every wood pile .
The JW considers itself THE kingdom of God on earth .
-LRB- ' Kindom Hall ' -RRB-
So it is only to be expected that they do not see a reason to run to and report everything to the government .
The same goes for the Roman Catholic Church .
But the RCC has had a widespread problem with this regard , doubltlessly because their policy / doctrine of a celibate priesthood simply attracts these deviants .
I doubt any such problem exist on the same proportionate scale in the JW heirarchy .
Besides that , ca n't you see the embedded mind control in that article , as well as all general media output .
The Message Is : `` Big Brother must be informed !
Only Big Brother can manage society ! ''
See , it 's the Hegelian dialectic at work .
Eveyone needs to sharpen their awareness of this shit .
As long as Big Brother is the answer for everything , Big Brother will BE everything .
-LRB- If people do n't want their kids pederastized , but yet they entrust them to ' guys in gowns ' I just wonder what the hell are they thinking anyway ? -RRB-
I 'd watch the Peter Pan speculations , unless you know what versions you are discussing and can differentiate between them accurately .
Some of the assumptions I 've seen -LRB- such as a couple made by Tim Boucher and Fantastic Planet in last year 's postings linked here -RRB- may have looked like they worked to support their thesis , but in actuality have either a tenuous or no connection to the core Peter Pan mythos .
Do n't make up things like Peter abducting children that you ca n't substantiate .
Peter Pan was a work in progress for JM Barrie , who kept tinkering with it over the years .
To understand what it actually means to Michael Jackson and what you might speculate he is enacting , you have to know where on the continuum of Peter Pans his internalized Peter -LRB- no , not THAT kind of peter -RRB- lies .
Novel , play ?
Musical , cartoon ?
Shadow of a shadow of a remembered story ?
In one of the oldest versions , Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens -LRB- extracted from The Little White Bird -RRB- , is only a week old .
He escaped from his home when he was seven days old because he remembered how he could fly when he was a bird before he was a human ,
and that wildness is still in him , as it is with all children .
Barrie 's only cryptic instructions on character development to Nina Boucicault , the first actress to play Peter , was that she was to remember that Peter is a bird , and is one day old .
In Kensington Gardens he watches out for children who have fallen un-noticed out of their perambulators .
If a bad fairy finds them , or they perish from the cold an dark overnight in the park , Peter digs them graves and makes them headstones .
In Peter and Wendy , the Lost Boys are the ones who fall out of their perambulators when their nurse is not looking .
If they are not claimed in seven days , `` they are sent far away to the Neverland to defray expenses . ''
A far cry from the stealing of children .
Peter and the Lost Boys crave a mother to tell them stories .
It 's ironic that while their own lives are far more exotic than the fairy tales Wendy tells , it 's those fictions that they want , told by a mother .
Barrie says quite explicitly in Peter and Wendy that it is Wendy who does the tempting to keep Peter with her , not the other way around .
It is she who asks if Michael and John could come too .
If those of you with the abduction theory would like to give specific quotes and information on where it is shown that Peter abducted the children , please do .
But I think you are making it up from a version that does n't exist in reality , or that ca n't be tied to Michael Jackson .
We do n't gain better understanding of the inner workings of Michael Jackson by distorting the material on which we purportedly base our theories .
Jeff - I just have to say that I love the Rigorous Intuition Live365 channel .
I 've been listening to it to the last couple of days and just bought Dylan 's ' Oh Mercy ' .
How does the copyright thing work on a Live365 stream ?
Avalon , can you recommend a good work of commentary and analysis on JM Barrie 's works ?

Was Michael Jackson influenced by Bob Fosse 's `` Snake in the grass '' character from the 1974 movie The Little Prince ?
Has anyone else seen this scene ?
Bob Fosse 's snake looks and moves would be imitated -LRB- and made more popular -RRB- years later by the King of Pop , Michael Jackson .

About the JW thing , I work with a couple of them -LRB- BTW , some of the most respectable people I know .
Which is why I decided to ask ... -RRB- ,
and I had a chance to ask them about MJ and the child abuse , if they knew anything .
About MJ they said , he is definately not a JW , despite what he says .
Provocative lyrics and grabbing ones crotch in public , does n't fit with their defination of ' Christian ' .
They said all they knew was that his mother -LRB- who apparently is still a member -RRB- took him to their church as a kid .
The father apparently had little or no involvement at all .
As for the child abuse , I have to agree with the post above , you can find abuse and ' sick ' individuals in ANY organization ,
but you have too look at the proportion to the rest of society .
One of my friends is an ' elder ' -LRB- soething like a ' local church leader ' -RRB- ,
but he also said their instructions say that if they hear of any abuse they are to follow local laws , which usually requires them to inform the police ASAP .
And if the abuse is at all serious to report it to the police regardless .
Though i do n't agree with all of their beliefs , I know these guys well enough to call them friends .
So in their respect , after reading some of the other comments , I decided to listen to their side before passing judgement .
We should ALL be careful not to pass judgement on ENTIRE groups of people based on the apparent actions of a few .
That is what Hitler tried to do .
With thiking like that , even if we got rid of the evil elite , a new set of ' evil elite ' would rise again in their place .
That seems to be the nature of man , though .
We have all got to do what we can without needlessly attacking the innocent .
Remember , group hatred only plays into their hands , be it racial , religious , or class .

Uri Geller was one of MJ 's handlers apparently .
The wave of continuous rain last week led to the collapse of the roof of the Fourth Aramco Primary School for Girls in low income ..
Fortunately , the school had no students in it during the collapse .
The students did not take the monthly exam at the time , while the administration offered a one - day vacation to allow for a search for another school .
The students were transferred to a governmental school until the Aramco School could be repaired .
The student " L. H. " says , " The situation is totally different .
We study in the prayer area of the governmental school , and we have been merged with two other classes . "
The funniest thing about this issue is that they converted the small storage room into a cafeteria .
The student " M. M. " says , " I hope we can go back to our school again , and that the roof wo n't fall on us again . "
On the other hand , teacher " M. A. " says , " The school principal was devastated .
She burst into tears and could not do anything . "
A source at Girls ' Education in Al Quataif said the collapse resulted from rainwater accumulation .
It is worth mentioning that there has been a total media blackout by related authorities .
Many confusing questions have been taxing my mind for years about Egypt and its people .
Are they really as miserable as we see them , or are our eyes deceiving us ?
Are the horrible statistics we read on the unemployment rates and the dangerous diseases that consume the liver , kidneys , and the entire body of the Egyptian real , or a fabrication of the nice governor ?
Is the waste of Egypt 's wealth from the seventies until today a reality , or an illusion ?
How did Egypt 's production of long - fiber cotton , the best in the world , drop from 12 million tons to just four tons ?
How was almost all the public sector sold , and where is its price ?
How did the Egyptian become the cheapest human being on the surface of the earth ?
Is this reasonable ?
Can we believe all this and believe at the same time that the people are still silent ?
What are these Egyptian people ?
How are they ?
How do they think ?
Why are they silent ?
Are they that cowardly ?
I do not stray far from the truth if I say that I have read a lot in sociology , from the Introduction of its founder , Ibn Khaldoun , passing by Gamal Hemdan -LRB- the best man to describe Egypt lately -RRB- , to the last student in the sociology department - the university of the poor , who are injured with knives and sticks and surrounded by the gangs of national sadness .
Not all that has been written of course , but what concerns us in guarded Egypt -LRB- I do not know where this guarding is ?! -RRB- , because I want to understand the Egyptian personality , and why it is silent in spite of all its suffering from injustice , suppression , starvation , and humiliation , and , of course , all this was accompanied by stops at our ancient and modern history .
Today I watched the news promoted by the American , Zionist , and Arab -LRB- Zionistic -RRB- media about the meetings currently being held between the American agents in Jordan , Saudi Arabia , Iran , and Egypt .
Except for Sheikh al - Dari , the people that appeared at the meetings with them were mostly agents of the occupier who came with him , using them to slaughter our people and families .
A number of them did not visit Iraq since their contract with the American intelligence service expired after the criminal Allawi fled two years ago in the wake of his failure to achieve victory over the Iranian agents .
As for Sheikh al - Dari ... the issuing of a warrant for his arrest was an important part of the game to keep him outside Iraq to facilitate contacting him -LRB- by coersion -RRB- and with not many options .
But Sheikh al - Dari will not swallow the bait easily ..
He is aware of what is being plotted .. and that Bush has not yet lost hope in the possibility of winning a political round which would prolong the life of his troops in Iraq ..
Therefore it is the duty of Sheikh al - Dari to present the conditions of resistance - victorious with God 's permission - because it is what will forge victory with the blood and lives of its youth and people .
Since the outbreak of the Iranian Revolution in the year 1979 and the overthrow of the Shah 's regime , and in spite of the power he enjoyed and the privilege he had with the US and Western countries , and in spite of the presence of the strongest intelligence service in the region -LRB- the SAVAK Agency -RRB- , the Iranian public was able to overthrow the government through the leadership of the Mullahs -LRB- religious men -RRB- without action from the super powers which had supported the Shah 's regime .
This raises many questions .
At the same time that the Mullahs came to power in Iran , another revolution erupted , but with a different course .
It took place in Afghanistan in 1979 under the leadership of a few people led by the Engineer Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Sheikh Abdul Rabb Rasoul Sayyaf .
But the general course of jihad and the influx of mujahideen in large numbers started in 1986 after the heroic Ansar battle in Jagi .
While the Arab and Western governments were busy with the issue of repelling Soviet occupation and communist encroachment , and with the war between Iraq and Iran , many overlooked a new development that was emerging on the ground , namely the orientation of Shiites in the Gulf region towards arms training in Iran , with the Revolutionary Guards at the time of the Iraqi - Iranian war , as well as in Lebanon , with Hezbollah -LRB- in the nineties -RRB- .
However , the general orientation of the Shiites towards regular and intensive training actually started in the early nineties .
Recently published Saudi studies warned that kohl is harmful to women 's eyes and can lead to loss of sight , especially the types common in Arab and Gulf countries because they contain high levels of lead .
Protecting the eyes against blindness begins with measures to look after the eyes , from regular eye tests by a specialist doctor , to knowing the necessary precautions to avoid eye injuries and first aid methods should an injury occur and the importance of not applying the kohl commonly used in the Kingdom and also not to apply any other folk remedies on the eyes .
With regard to kohl and its effect on the eyes , doctors at King Faisal Specialist Hospital have found that the percentage of lead in random samples of kohl of the kind sold at perfumeries and available in shops , especially Indian brands , is between 85 percent and 100 percent per gram of kohl .
Doctors explained that this percentage of lead is harmful for the eyes , especially in children after it was found that there is a link between using kohl and lead poisoning in children , and the brain disorders it causes because children 's eyes can not produce tears to wash external pollutants out of the eyes .
This can cause acute eye infections .
They indicated that disorders such as these lead to a 25 % increase in the death rate in children .
Specialists warned against the false but commonly held belief that kohl improves vision , increases the thickness and strength of eyelashes and makes the eyebrows thicker .
They recommended using kohl pencils which are sold in pharmacies , because they contain carbon and iron , both of which do not affects the eye and its health .

Title : Something Even More Absurd Than the " Breakneck 90 M/H On a Snowy Night " ?? My Personal Experience .
Originating site : BBS Unknown Space -LRB- Tue Jan 16 22:51:46 2007 -RRB- .
I have deep feelings and a lot of sympathy with the author after reading the article Breakneck 90 m/h on a Snowy Night .
It also reminds me of something that I experienced several years ago , also related to an airport and meeting people .
A couple of years ago , my neighbor approached me to borrow my car , saying he was meeting his parents at the airport .
He also said both his wife and children wanted to go .
As his car was too small and mine was big , it could make his parents more comfortable .
He added that he would only use it for one morning and would return it to me before noon .
Although there was only a nodding acquaintance between the neighbor and me , we lived in the same apartment building after all and were both Chinese .
So I discussed with my wife back home and lent him the car as we thought we would not be using the car until the same afternoon .
And then something happened ...
At 1:00pm , the neighbor called me , saying he took his parents to a buffet and would probably not to be back until around 3:00pm .
I of course agreed and asked them not to rush .
This wait lasted till 5:30pm , when the neighbor told me in a half - crying tone that there was an accident , and everyone else was intact , except his father , who was in hospital for fractures .
I comforted him first and asked my friend to rush me to the hospital .
My neighbor showed me the police report at the hospital , which indicated it was all my neighbor 's fault .
He clashed into a truck going straight when he made a left turn .
My car was completely damaged and had been towed away .
I forced myself to refrain from the grief of loosing my beloved car -LRB- mine was liability - only coverage -RRB- and asked the friend to send their family home .
And then the nightmare began .
The next day , my neighbor called me , saying his father needed to undergo an operation in hospital and asked where the money would come from
I told him part would be covered by my car insurance .
After a while , he called again , saying the operation charge was high and it was difficult for them to afford
I tried my best to comfort him then and told him to think of a way slowly
Just then , a nearly crazy voice of a woman came from the other end of the line , saying her family had just saved several dozen thousand bucks for the down payment of a house ; where would they live afterwards if they spent this .
She also said my car was a Japanese one , which had poor safety performance and it was my car to blame for the car accident .
She added that I should pay the money because the car was mine .
I hung up the phone angrily as the dialog could not go on .
My wife -LSB- pw% -RSB- had been persuading me aside , saying some women would easily lose mind once in fury .
She asked me to take no heed of them and let them calm down first .
So I did n't take their words seriously but still felt angry .
Out of my expectation , a phone call on the third day completely changed my original idea .
The telephone rang just as I was about to go to work in the morning .
I thought it was a sales call and was prepared to end it perfunctorily .
Unexpectedly , coming from the other end of the line was a deep and resolute voice of a middle - aged man .
He said in an incontestable tone that my neighbor had a car accident as a result of borrowing my car , which traumatized them both physically and mentally and harmed their economic interests , and as the car owner , they would not sue me if I compensated them for the hospital charge and the costs of missing work hours -LRB- three times -RRB- , otherwise they would see me in court .
He added that he was certain about the case as a lawyer in business for ten years and the compensation he requested could double in court .
As a great Chinese guy , how could I be scared by a few remarks of the lawyer ?
I also took up the weapon of law for justice .
Of course , I also retained a lawyer .
Out of my expectation , my lawyer solved the problem by merely making two phone calls .
One was to the police station , asking for any additional findings in the investigation report of the accident .
There was additional findings unexpectedly , which were against them .
Someone at the junk yard found a bottle of unfinished wine without the lid inside the car and reported it to the police station .
The police found they put the bottle of unfinished wine in the car without the lid after lunch .
The second call was to their lawyer .
So their lawyer dropped the lawsuit .
Of course , they would not stop it there and came to discuss with me several times , sometimes honey - tongued and sometimes threatening .
The most classic one was : Do n't ever dream of living a life back to China , as we have people across the country .
Disgusting !
Here comes the old topic again , are you going to lend your car if your neighbor or friend asks .
I think many people will say they wo n't .
I would suggest not to lend online .
However , the Internet is after all virtual .
Words sometimes have no emotions .
When your seemingly nice neighbor , seemingly close friend , or a girl whose eyes can speak asks for it in the real world , how many people will answer with a " no ? "
Anyhow , I was not able to do that .
I lent my car to some people in need after that , and I believe there are not many people like my former neighbor couple .
In conclusion , here is a summery of the loss of the two sides : .
Our side : A 02 Camary of 50,000 miles , retaining fee 200 . Annual leave two days .
Their side : One leg of the father -LRB- repaired -RRB- , hospital charge : unknown , costs for missing work hours : unknown , retaining fee : unknown .
And most importantly : the dignity and honor of the entire family -LRB- except children -RRB- .

Guo Kai 's Economic Notes : Beijing 's Gas Price vs. US Gas Price
Guo Kai 's Economic Notes
In the US the current average price of regular unleaded gas is about 2.3 US dollars per gallon -LRB- 3.78 liters -RRB- .
According to the official exchange rate of one US dollar for 7.9 RMB , this price is equivalent to 4.80 yuan / liter .
Note , this gas price includes all taxes .
The current gas price in Beijing is 5.09 yuan / liter , 2 mao and 9 fen more than in the US .
In fact , the gas price difference between the two places is larger than 2 mao and 9 fen because China 's gas price does not include so many taxes as in the US ; for example , the highway maintenance fee in China is paid separately .
Just now , I only narrated a fact .
But I believe that different persons see different problems in this fact .
Let me describe people 's two reactions that I can imagine , or the two problems I can see .
1. The US gas price is too cheap .
In an absolute sense , the US gas price has +already been cheaper than China 's , and in a relative sense , the US gas price is even cheaper .
In the US , the money you pay for a meal at McDonald 's can fill up more than 10 liters of gas , but in Beijing you can get 5 - 6 liters of gas at most .
The US low gas price policy has undoubtedly led to this country 's excessive use of and overdependence on energy resources .
However , there is more to this matter , the whole world has to share the various negative effects caused by the US excessive energy consumption : global warming , and wars caused by oil , etc.
It is totally a joke that the US gas price could be cheaper than China 's .
2. China 's gas price is too expensive .
Both Americans and Chinese buy gas from the international market , and the technology and cost of oil refinement are not too much different .
But with the US gas price including taxes even lower than China 's gas price excluding taxes , you can see how much money Chinese oil companies have made out of this .
If there are no price controls and monopolies , China 's gas price should n't have been this high .
I want to say that I think these two opinions are both correct .
So , on the issue of oil consumption , I think China and the US , the No. 1 and No. 2 oil consumers in the world , are also a funny pair .
From a global perspective , the US gas price is obviously too low .
So Mankiw at Harvard even formed a " Pigou Club , " gathering social celebrities who support levying higher taxes on gas prices -LRB- hereby raising gas prices -RRB- .
China 's gas prices are more complicated .
In fact , gas prices in China are probably not very high , but in order to reduce China 's future overdependence on gas , it may be better that China 's gas prices are higher .
But , the direct result of the gas price increase in China will be the increase of monopoly profits of the monopoly companies .
This part of money will not become the government tax revenue , will not be used for public welfare , and on the contrary , will only make the benefits of those people working at the monopoly department even better .
In other words , the gas price in China is too high in the distributive sense .
It is the price that transfers the entire social resources to a very small number of people .
But in terms of sustainability , China 's gas price may still be too low .
We need high gas prices to control the overdependence on energy imports .
Perhaps someone will condemn me , saying further increase of gas prices will make life unbearable for people .
If you are a taxi driver , my reply is : the reason your life is unbearable is not the gas price , but because of our taxi licensing regulation system .
If you are a car owner , my reply is : ride the subway and bus more often .
It saves money , reduces congestion , and also lets you know car owners are not in a position to say " life is unbearable . "
Compared with most people , your life is already quite good .

Comparing McDonald 's in the US with McDonald 's in China may not be right .
Eating a meal at McDonald 's in the US is more comparable to buying a 5 - yuan boxed meal in China .
Advice to Wu Jinglian and Others : Killing the Father -- Does You No Good ! .

Advice to Wu Jinglian and Others : Killing the Father -- Does You No Good ! .
-- Some Thoughts on the Attitude of Benign Inheritance towards Social Reform .
A glance at the title , people with a little political sensitivity may roughly understand the core topic of this article : the rule of benign interaction between planned economy and market economy , and between public ownership and private ownership -- because only their relationships are those between a father and a son , and it is only between them are there different conflicts involving " human relations , " " rules " and " science , " as well as bloody wrestling between classes , factions and individuals on the basis of morality and interests .
Comparing planned economy and public ownership to a father is tantamount to comparing market economy and private ownership to a son , which holds water principally and historically no matter you put it this way or another .
This is because the former two given " fatherhood " are indeed the most essential factors of the national character and institution of the socialist new China , while the latter two dubbed " son " in this article -- are indeed the ideological outcomes derived after the death of China 's founder Comrade Mao Zedong under tremendous international and domestic political pressures on planned economy and public ownership , which grew into today 's para-system after about 30 years of reform and opening up .
Regarding this , the factual development process of political civilization that the Marxist ideology has been increasingly marginalized over the past 30 years or so is a strong evidence .
By sorting out the essence of the above historical background and conceptual relationships , we will have a pretty thorough , comprehensive and systematic knowledge framework about the benign inevitable trends and development guidelines of the future society dependent on the rule of society , so that the associated impression captured may be more concrete .
Regarding this , my standpoint is : because the socialism underpinned by planned economy , public ownership and the people 's democratic dictatorship is indeed a really " fresh " systemic thing for China in the mid and late 20th century -- without a model or sufficient experience or theories to refer to , no matter how scientific its kernel is , it is hard not to have certain superficial and local problems .
However , this should not provide an excuse to overthrow it by fair means or foul , as he is our father and the common choice of millions of laboring people .
The fact that it " finally became our national character and main system after over half a century of international and domestic political transformation " is a stronger proof that it is the milestone for a new civilization resulted from the blood and sweat of thousands of proletarian revolutionary martyrs .
Therefore , no matter from the perspective of average citizens or from the standpoint of the founder of the new government , we should respect and develop her on the basis of inheritance , innovation and improvement .
Is my opinion above correct ?
I believe you will naturally obtain a relatively fair and just conclusion if you could understand and treat the above - mentioned " father " system and " son " system with impartiality and sufficient goodwill .
For example , based on the existing institutional cultural heritage in the human history , we could see : the " father " system mentioned herein has the majority in mind or it is established in the fundamental and long - term interests of the majority , as well as the need for sustainable and sound development of the country , the nation , and the overall society -- while the " son " system mentioned herein is ignorant and sick in the company of such behavioral characteristics as exploitation , fraudulence , pernicious influence and robbery .
So , we can not urge the son to throttle the essentially healthy and scientific " father " system by fair mean or foul without considering the consequences , because there are problems in its practice and development -- such as state monopoly for purchases and sales , lower efficiency due to centralized management , and inhibition of the will of productivity by undue political pressure resulting from class struggles during the new deal .
It is because that will not only make the society increasingly ignorant and sick as it violates the rule of benign social development , distorts normal " human relations " and the ethic and prevalent value and the rule of civilization update rooted in it , but the humanity will retrogress as people 's thoughts and behaviors become increasingly ridiculous .
Yes , this is the case .
My opinion above is not absurd and delusive at all , because this is true not only in theory , but also to the rule of social development as demonstrated by historical facts , as well as from the perspective of the situation and reality of the country : None of the current " advocates of market economy , private ownership and dictatorship of the bourgeoisie " has established and proposed a new deal " against planned economy , public ownership and dictatorship of the proletariat . "
All their criticisms are directed at the developmental symptoms such as " lower efficiency due to centralized management " or " inhibition of the will of productivity by undue political pressure resulting from class struggles during the new deal , " all their proclamations are political attacks and instigation aimed to win over the less than 5 % " vested interests , " and their development logic asks the " 95 % " laboring people to stay where they are and willingly endure the hard work -- it speaks for itself how empty , ridiculous , sick , ignorant and anti-government it is .
That 's why I want to say to the world and the age by the end of the article : when the father 's toes are injured , we should try our best to treat the foot problem , and open up a new life and embrace health in the principle of respecting human relations , obeying people 's wishes , conforming to science and carrying on the legacy -- if the present capitalist followers frantically urge the son to kill him by all means , the result could only be a tragedy !
And these happen to be the core of the destiny where the capitalist roaders " will inevitably bury themselves due to their ignorance and insanity , and more or less harm the human society ! "
At last , I would like to admonish sincerely and earnestly those who blindly oppose , hate and even suppress planned economy , public ownership and dictatorship of the proletariat , especially the " mainstream elite scholars " including Wu Jinglian , who insist on smearing the " father " to the end : do not treat the " fathers " on which the new civilization is based barbarously , against your conscience and frantically for immediate gains .
The result is definitely a tragedy -- because even if you kill the " father , " your felony will be disdained by the age and condemned by the people , which naturally leads to nothing good !

[] Outer Mongolia Voluntarily Proposes to Return to China : a Conspiracy to Alienate China and Russia ?
[] <POSTER> jeffery7373
[jeffery7373] Recently , a message " Mongolian Parliament Proposes to Merge Mongolia into China " is extraordinarily striking .
[jeffery7373] It was reported that State Great Hural of Mongolia was currently discussing a proposal about a plan for Mongolia and China to found a federal state .
[jeffery7373] The Govi member first put forward the above plan in the State Social and Economic Development Seminar .
[jeffery7373] On October 30 , 2004 , State Great Hural of Mongolia held a special discussion on the establishment of Sino - Mongolian coalition and merger of Mongolia into China .
[jeffery7373] During the discussion , the Govi member proposed to merge Mongolia into China and build a special administrative district like Hong Kong and Macau in China , making Mongolia return to the motherland finally and becoming a part of China .
[jeffery7373] As early as 1995 , 2000 and 2002 , there were parliamentary members who kept proposing to join Mongolia with China , but these bills never get discussed due to the resistances .
[jeffery7373] In recent years , Mongolian government faces growing pressure arising from economic hardship .
The wealthy life of the Mongolian nationality in places like Erlian in China resulted in strong attractions to herdsmen .
[jeffery7373] People including many upper class figures are increasingly attracted by China 's economic growth , particularly the relative prosperity and affluence in Inner Mongolia .
[jeffery7373] However , on the other hand China 's ambition to " recapture " Outer Mongolia in its political territory will also be very far away and even nearly impossible .
[jeffery7373] First , there are still enormous resistances inside Mongolia against " returning " to China .
Moreover , even the form of merger conceived by those " returnists " also has some divergences from China 's will .
[jeffery7373] Second , international resistances , including those from USA , Japan and particularly Russia , are sure to be very vehement .
After all , we still need Russia 's help in our international strategy and defense development .
[jeffery7373] Third , the response of the Mongolian nationality to this issue can not be ignored either .
[jeffery7373] One thing to point out is that the loyalty of China 's Mongolian nationality to their country is unquestionable .
[jeffery7373] If " Tibetan independence " and " Xinjiang independence " may have more or less social foundation among Tibetan and Xinjing people , the so - called " Mongolian independence " is absolutely the mental masturbation of a tiny proportion of Mongolian intellectuals and overseas anti-China powers .
[jeffery7373] Despite all this , many Mongolian in Inner Mongolia are not willing to see the complete disappearance of an independent Mongolia .
I believe such sentiment should be understandable .
[jeffery7373] Hastily " recapturing " Outer Mongolia may cause resistance among Inner Mongolian people .
[jeffery7373] Background Information .
[jeffery7373] The Great Hural of Mongolia proposed to return to China 43 times .
[jeffery7373] In 1921 , the Mongolian people won the revolution and declared independence in July and established a " constitutional monarchy . "
[jeffery7373] Following the death of Jebtsundamba in May 1924 , the 1st People 's Great Hural was held in Kulun on November of the same year and declared the abolishment of Constitutional Monarchy and founded the People 's Republic of Mongolia .
[jeffery7373] On February 11 , 1945 , the leaders of USA , USSR and UK signed Yalta Agreement that covered the sovereignty of Outer Mongolia .
[jeffery7373] In 1946 , the National Government of China recognized the independence of Outer Mongolia .
[jeffery7373] Upon the foundation of the People 's Republic of China , it established its diplomatic relations with China on October 16 , 1949 .
[jeffery7373] Mongolia is an inland country and borders China and Russia only .
[jeffery7373] This determines three types of nation survival strategies , pro-Russia or pro-China or balance among powers .
[jeffery7373] At present , Mongolia 's nation survival strategy is balance among powers and seeks the maximum interests for itself .
[jeffery7373] Prior to the breakdown of the Soviet Union , Mongolia did n't have its own troops and defense was provided by the Soviet Union .
[jeffery7373] After the disintegration of the Soviet Union , Mongolia started to build its compulsory service scheme and recruit frontier troops .
[jeffery7373] However , Mongolia borders China and Russia only , and even all people are soldiers can not guarantee the 100 percent security of its soil .
[jeffery7373] Thus , it has nearly no military forces .
[jeffery7373] In fact , the Soviet Union itself ever considered the incorporation of Mongolia as a union republic seriously and provided permanent defense , but gave it up because of the strong objection from Mongolia .
[jeffery7373] The control of Russia over the Far East area was significantly reduced as a result of its domestic weakness .
[jeffery7373] The breakdown of the Soviet Union had huge and far - reaching effects on China , [jeffery7373] and made great contributions to the whole world , [jeffery7373] and benefits Chinese nationalities a lot .
[jeffery7373] The military expenditure for the land forces could be transferred to the air and naval forces , and there emerged a growingly powerful air force and blue ocean fleet and a relatively safe and peaceful construction period of several decades , and China can come close to the feasible action that will solve the Taiwan issue indeed , [jeffery7373] and the military science made substantial progress , and the ideologically blank area left as a result of the disintegration of the Soviet Union -LRB- these traditional scope of the Soviet Union 's influence like Iran and Egypt in Middle East , and Cuba , Venezuela and Bolivia in Latin America -RRB- was gained quickly ,
[jeffery7373] This was impossible to achieve before the disintegration of the Soviet Union .
[jeffery7373] Meanwhile , it brought a very rare opportunity for Mongolia 's return .
[jeffery7373] Although the Great Hural of Mongolia proposed to return to China 43 times , China has n't made any positive comments and feedback so far .
[jeffery7373] Voice .
[jeffery7373] It is not the right time for Mongolia 's return .
[jeffery7373] Firstly , Mongolia 's geographic location is very important and situated between China and Russia .
If Mongolia returned to China , it would cast shadow on Sino - Russian relations inevitably and damage the whole situation of the Sino - Russian strategic cooperation .
[jeffery7373] In the period of Three Kingdoms , Sun Quan and Liu Bei broke their coalition for Jing prefecture .
[jeffery7373] Mongolia has an important strategic location as Jing prefecture .
[jeffery7373] Both China and Russia develop friendly relations with Mongolia , which has positive impact on the stabilization of Sino - Russian borders and Mongolia 's domestic situation .
[jeffery7373] Otherwise , If Mongolia returned , it would make Russia feel facing a great enemy and obstruct the rise of Russia .
[jeffery7373] A weak Russia allows USA to concentrate on threatening China , which will undermine the benefits of our great strategy .
[jeffery7373] Secondly , we are not strong enough .
[jeffery7373] Among many problems related to the reunification of the motherland , Mongolia has low priority , far less important than Taiwan , Diaoyu Island and South Sea .
[jeffery7373] We can not accept Mongolia because of its voluntary return .
[jeffery7373] Before these problems get solved , the timing of Mongolia 's return can not be mature .
[jeffery7373] It is quite simple .
If the nation is not strong , we can not get reunified for reunification and lose the great opportunity to develop our strength .
[jeffery7373] Thirdly , Mongolia 's motivation for return is not strong , and its will is not firm and can be suspected to be a kind of speculation .
[jeffery7373] Nowadays , Mongolia is developing friendly relations with both USA and Japan and conducted joint military exercises with USA , which has troops stationed in Mongolia .
All these indicate that Mongolia 's return may be a giant alienating conspiracy , the purpose of which is to make China and Russia suspect each other and fight against each other for Mongolia and lose cooperation and trust .
[jeffery7373] Fourthly , for China and Russia , they should develop their relations with Mongolia jointly and expel the forces of USA and Japan out of Mongolia .
This is what we should do , [jeffery7373] rather than accept Mongolia 's hesitant return blindly .
[jeffery7373] Offering to ally with Russia , reaching its understanding and developing relations with Mongolia , are our best strategy .
[jeffery7373] Therefore , we are patriots but not blind ones .
Only if we have strategic thinking , consider the long - term stability and security of the country , and consider the international situations , we can make the best decision .
[herobeauty] Which year 's news ?
[saite] Without doubt , the strategic location of Mongolia is more important than Taiwan .
[saite] If Mongolia can be recaptured , it deserves high priority .
[saite] In fact , the real implacable enemies of China are not the United States but Russia and Japan .
[saite] I prefer to give up Taiwan rather than Mongolia .
[saite] Recapturing Mongolia can give Russia a fatal strike and meanwhile further secure our geographically strategic environment .
[saite] Churchill ever said there was no friendship but interests between nations .
[saite] We do n't need to care about the feeling of Russian .
[saite] Actually , we and Russian have been deeply suspicious and jealous of each other all the time , but both remain tacit .
[saite] China has to rely on itself to become mighty .
[saite] -LRB- In the master piece of jeffery7373 -LRB- midou -RRB- , it is mentioned : -RRB-
[saite] : Recently , a message " Mongolian Parliament Proposes to Merge Mongolia into China " is extraordinarily arresting .
It was reported that State Great [saite] : Hural of Mongolia was currently discussing a proposal about a plan for Mongolia and China to found a federal state .
The Govi representative [saite] : first put forward the above plan in the State Social and Economic Development Seminar .
On October 30 , 2004 , State Great Hural of Mongolia [saite] : held a special discussion on the establishment of Sino - Mongolian coalition and merger of Mongolia into China .
During the discussion , the Govi member [saite] : proposed to merge Mongolia into China and build a special administrative district like Hong Kong and Macau in China , making Mongolia [saite] : return to the motherland finally and becoming a part of China .
[saite] : As early as 1995 , 2000 and 2002 , there were parliamentary members who kept proposing to join Mongolia with China , [saite] : but these bills never get discussed due to the resistances .
In recent years , Mongolian government faces growing pressure arising from [saite] : economic hardship .
The wealthy life of the Mongolian nationality in places like Erlian in China resulted in strong attractions to herdsmen .
People including [saite] : many upper class figures are increasingly attracted by China 's economic growth , particularly the relative prosperity and affluence in Inner Mongolia .

It can be solved sooner or later .
[zoun] This Mongolia was lost in the hands of Old Jiang , so it is a problem .
[zoun] The map of the Republic of China is always in a shape of mulberry leaf , is n't it ?
[zoun] Once Taiwan is taken back , the name of the country can be changed to the Republic of China with the flag of blue sky and white sun and the mulberry leaf - shaped map reused .
In this way , we have more reasons and confidences to recapture Mongolia .
Hehe .

A month ago , I was really desperate , I lost my current job , which I was completely unprepared for , and had to find a job within a month to keep myself going .
Now in this month with the Christmas holiday there 's really only three weeks of actual work time , and I do n't think any companies are going to be hiring people during this period .
Despair , that sinking feeling weighing on my mind , so much pressure I could n't eat , could n't sleep ; I was simply going crazy .
But I still needed to do something ; getting crazy - hysteric makes no sense .
Then I started connecting with my friends in America ; I went to Maimaiti to ask for help , consulted about my status , and looked for a way to solve the problem .
Even my relatives ' friends in America and my parents ' friends all got involved .
Friends , it 's always friends who help me at key moments .
Many friends got people they knew to recommend me , help me send out resumes , or call and commiserate with me .
There was one friend who had just got an offer , but he did n't want to go , so he recommended me to go for him , but it was way off in LA , plus the salary was n't ideal , but at least it could help me keep the legal status , so I thought I would take it .
After the telephone interview , I flew to LA , landing at 12:00 noon , and at 4:00 p.m. .
I had the interview .
By then 17 - 18 hours had passed since I 'd gotten up at 4:00 a.m.
Although I was too tired to walk , I still had to pump up my spirits so I 'd be in peak form for the interview .
The interview did n't last long , just two hours and it was over .
I felt the interview went well , and started to feel confident .
But on that day one senior level person was n't there , so the next day early I had to go back to talk to him .
So the next day I got up at 7:00 and ran over to chat for an hour ; that guy was nice , did n't embarrass me , so after an hour it ended happily .
After that the boss took me to the home office , and on the way he gave me an oral offer , and he said it would not be easy for me to come right away , that I should do the physical exam immediately and do all the paperwork , wait until after New Year 's , and the HR director would return and turn in the H1 .
Then I went straight for the physical , and I filled out the application form , reference list , etc.
At 3:00 p.m. , the dust finally settled .
Finally before Christmas I received a Christmas present .
Although I still have n't made the final decision to go , at least I have a guaranteed - minimum choice .
So I am thanking everyone for helping me .
I hope that all my friends who are still looking for work will be able to find their ideal job in the New Year .

Eliminate the personal income tax -LRB- Reproduced from Yueguang blog -RRB- .
Dift Wu
Official data confirm that in 2004 the total personal income tax for the country amounted to approximately 181 billion , of which 65 % came from the working class , and only 10 % came from the wealthy .
Clearly the personal income tax policy has too little effect on controlling wealth accumulation by the rich , and too little impact on improving the quality of life of wage earners .
While this type of tax in China has no effect on regulating the income gap or on " taking from the rich to help the poor , " neither is it beneficial in expanding the working class .
If this tax continues to be collected , it will be working against the original intention behind the income tax .
Clearly the necessity for the personal income tax needs to be challenged .
I propose eliminating the personal income tax just as the agricultural tax was eliminated , to give people an opportunity to prosper .
If we think in terms of humanizing the system , i.e. , helping the poor by letting poor people get rich , we should give low - and moderate - income people a chance to improve and raise the quality of their lives ; the threshold for China 's personal income tax should be at least tripled from the starting threshold of 800 yuan per month , i.e. , to 6400 yuan per person .
That would take it to a minimally humanized level , and then we could really talk about " people first . "
With a threshold below this level , the poor will always be poor .
Yesterday CCTV presented a program on adjustment of the personal income tax , emphasized that the main goal of the adjustment was to " take from the rich " and let poor people get wealthy .
If we really want to give poor people a chance to get wealthy , the threshold for the personal income tax should be tripled .
With anything under this threshold , the poor will have no chance to get rich .
And if we 're looking at it in terms of " taking from the rich , " the problem to be adjusted is definitely not whether or not to tax income but rather the problem of the actual method for distributing China 's social national income , namely how to eliminate the " unreported income . "
The income of the vast majority of China 's rich people is unreported income , and unreported income is a problem that Chinese society will not be able to solve for quite a long time to come ; it is a characteristic of China , an uncontrollable black hole in China 's social oversight .
This is far from being a tax problem ; it is a deeper systemic problem .
If China 's personal income tax can not achieve the effect of helping the poor to become rich , neither can it control the excessive incomes of the wealthy , so what is it we expect this personal income tax to do ?
It would be better to eliminate it in one fell swoop , as we did with the agricultural tax .
Below are some of the main reasons :
1. China 's income tax can not become a tool for keeping the poor perpetually poor ; it can not become a social tool that keeps on producing a penniless proletariat .
In China the primary function of the income tax is to increase the state 's financial revenues ; it is not to regulate the income gap .
In 2004 China 's income taxes amounted to approximately 180 billion , accounting for about 6 % of the state 's financial revenues .
But of this 180 billion , about 65 % , or 117 billion , was paid by the working class .
Less than 10 % was paid by the wealthy .
In China more than 90 % of the people who depend on fully declared total earnings for a living are urban poor .
These poor people , who struggle just to pay for the necessities of life , their children 's education , old age , illness and death , also have to pay income tax .
In all of China 's cities now , anyone with a monthly income of 2000 yuan or less is considered poor .
If a husband and wife have a total monthly work income of 2000 yuan , and if they pay 33 % income tax on anything over 1500 yuan , they have a disposable income of only 1670 yuan .
A household like this can not even continue bearing basic living expenses , and their standard of living will decline .
And should anyone in the household get sick and have to go to the hospital , the family may well find itself in an economic crisis .
And if a family like this wants to buy its own home , that will basically be impossible .
And if only one person in a three - person family is employed , the family will have a very difficult life .
But even so , they have to pay 165 yuan in income tax .
Clearly , if our income tax threshold is set at 1500 yuan , our society is destined always to produce a proletariat , always to deny hope to the poor or to the masses of ever getting rich .
Our production relations are no different from the production relations in Marx 's " Das Kapital , " constantly reproducing a proletariat who can only rely on selling its labor to make a living .
In short , if the personal income tax threshold is set lower than 6400 yuan , it will be ineffective in helping the poor get rich .
Conversely , if the threshold is too low , it will cleanly and quickly inhibit the ability of poor people to get rich .
2. The personal income tax is absolutely unable to control the accumulation of wealth by the rich .
We should not entertain any illusions that China 's income tax can in any way regulate income distribution , much less that it can " take from the rich and give to the poor . "
In Chinese society , 20 % of the people hold 80 % of social wealth , and 80 % of the people are able to use only 20 % of the social wealth to suffer through their lives .
In China , freedom , human rights , democracy , happiness and all the other most effective benefits that society can offer refer only to 20 % of the people .
Western countries that attack China for not having human rights , democracy and freedom are quite wrong ; these 20 % of upper - class citizens have broader human rights , democracy and freedom than do Western societies .
When God looks at China , he sees only these 20 % ; the other 80 % he ca n't see clearly .
The income of the vast majority of these 20 , of upper - class citizens in China is basically unreported income ; the proportion of their income that comes from fully declared earnings is a negligible part of their wealth .
Only if China eliminated unreported income would the income tax have an effect on rich people .
And if China wants to eliminate unreported income , to date there is no sign of that , and there is no compelling evidence to explain when China might eliminate unreported income .
Anyhow , it is not something our generation will see .
That is why the income tax has no effect on regulating the wealth of China 's rich people .
It does however have a highly restrictive effect on the ability of poor people to get rich .
A very simple explanation is that poor people are all wage earners who rely on fully declared wages for their living ; they do not have unreported income .
Fully 100 % of their income falls within the income - tax field of vision , so they ca n't escape even if they wanted to .
Add to this the fact that the threshold is under the level required to meet the necessary expenditures to maintain the basic necessities of life , and the poor are completely stymied .
" Dragons give birth to dragons , phoenixes to phoenixes ; the son of a bandit will live in a cave . "
" The children of poor people are always poor . "
With the previous 800 yuan income tax threshold , if it were strictly enforced , 80 % of beggars would have to pay .
With a threshold set below 5000 yuan , this generation of poor people need not think about buying a home or driving a car .
They will always be poor .
Of course , many children of poor people are able to get rich , but this came about because the parents struggled harder , tightening their belts and " skimping on food and clothing " for themselves .
Now how many university students who have received acceptance notifications are unable to enroll , and how many enrolled university students from the countryside have parents who are living through unimaginably hard times ?
In Western countries , the personal income tax is the most effective means of controlling excessively high incomes among the rich .
But these are countries ruled by law , where official income is all recorded , citizen 's incomes are fully transparent , and therefore the personal income tax can easily achieve the effect of regulating income distribution .
The situation in China is not like that ; if the personal income tax has an effect , it 's to increase financial revenues , and it has absolutely no income - regulating effect .
3. Eliminating the income tax will benefit peasants .
The vast majority of China 's 900 million peasants are unable to reach the income level for paying income tax .
But the peasants have contractual land , they have a low - consumption rural lifestyle and conditions , and they have basic housing .
But if people in the cities do n't have money , everything is a struggle .
If they go shopping for food by bike , they have to pay 20 cents for parking .
They ca n't not pay the rent or they 'll have to sleep on the street .
In terms of macroeconomic law , the distribution of wealth in Chinese society is set at 2/8 , with the 20 % of wealthy people holding 80 % of the social wealth , and the 80 % of poor people holding just 20 % of the social wealth .
The personal income tax threshold is too low , the urban population is too large , and the population participating in the 20 % that goes to peasants is even greater , so the peasants ultimately have to get a reduced share of this 20 % .
If we eliminate the personal income tax , the number of poor people in the cities will be reduced , and the people participating in the peasant struggle for this 20 % will be reduced , which will benefit the peasants .
In China the wealthy will always hold 80 % of the social wealth ; there has never been a softhearted rich person .
4. This will really be beneficial in establishing a soft - landing market economy system .
In recent years China 's rate of state financial growth has been higher than economic growth ; this is a highly abnormal phenomenon , and in terms of economic theory it is highly adverse for sustained , healthy growth of the national economy .
The blood has all been pumped out of the national economy ; it 's like eating up all the seeds sown in the spring .
The proportion of financial revenues from the personal income tax is about 6 % .
If we cancel out this 6 % , we can slow down financial growth .
And in the Chinese economic cycle , excessive financial investment is not a good thing for economic growth and the establishment of a true market economy system .
Compared to market investment , the efficiency of financial investment is less than half .
And when there is too much financial investment , corruption is everywhere , all the time .
5. It promotes the establishment of a harmonious society .
Chinese and foreign history amply demonstrates that a harmonious society is an olive - shaped society : the distribution of numbers of poor , middle - class and wealthy people making up the society is small at either end and larger in the middle , with 40 % or more of the society being middle class .
Chinese society is 80 % poor people , 20 % wealthy ; there is no stable middle class , or it floats between the lower levels of the wealthy and the upper end of the poor and is highly unstable .
There is no way this " 2/8 " social structure can establish a harmonious society .
Eliminating the personal income tax to accumulate wealth for the people will be beneficial in producing and nourishing a middle class and will promote the creation of a harmonious society .
In short , if our personal income tax policy can not help the poor get rich , and is unable to limit the excessive increase in wealth among the rich , then it is better not to have this kind of personal income tax .
We need to adopt this kind of strategic insight when we consider this matter , so as to benefit the country and the people .

[] You should stand by your child .
Re : I can only stand by the facts -LRB- forward -RRB- .
[] <POSTER> Bcc
[Bcc] -LSB- the following article was forwarded from Overseas Discussion Area -RSB- .
[Bcc] I do n't know what the best way to deal with your child is .
Do you know ?
[Bcc] You 're 20 years old ; when you decided to have him , did you think you 'd be going through this problem ?
[Bcc] If you 're thinking only of this child , then you should use legal means as quickly as possible to resolve this problem .
[Bcc] But what the law can resolve is only the issue of alimony .
[Bcc] How do you plan on getting through the future ?
[Bcc] Will this child grow up in China or in the United States ?
[Bcc] If in the United States , how will you support yourself ?
[Bcc] How can you assure his livelihood ?
[Bcc] By relying on Professor Cui 's alimony ?
[Bcc] By relying on government assistance ?
[Bcc] Even with both parents working , supporting a child is difficult .
[Bcc] How can you assure this child 's education , food and clothing ?
[Bcc] The child is blameless .
[Bcc] Regardless of the reason that he came into this world , you can say that you struggled with all these difficulties for his benefit .
[Bcc] But what did all this struggling get you ?
[Bcc] And what do you plan to struggle for ?
[Bcc] You and CY ca n't be together .
[Bcc] Even if his wife divorces him , her two children will need alimony too .
[Bcc] Of all that you struggle for , the only thing left may be a limited amount of money and this child 's nationality .
[Bcc] These things are far from enough to give him the happiness he needs .
[Bcc] What he needs is a stable , warm home , a loving and not hostile environment , a mother at peace with herself .
[Bcc] Whether you love CY or you hate him , it 's a mistake .
[Bcc] You should not let this mistake influence your judgment , a judgment about the future and welfare of your child .
[Bcc] If you really loved him , then God has already granted you the fruit of this love ;
[Bcc] if you still bear animosity , then you should learn to forget that animosity in the warm expression in your child 's eyes , and not contaminate his purity with your animosity .
[Bcc] Ugliness is its own punishment .
[Bcc] In court , you carry that child , looking for the man who loves him and loves you .
[Bcc] I hope mother and child are in good health and happy .
[Bcc] -LSB- in xiaojueniu -LRB- peace is happiness -RRB- 's article , this was mentioned : -RSB- :

[Bcc] : I ca n't shield anyone , I can only stand by the facts , I ca n't commit perjury , Cui Yi did not negotiate with me , and now I have not [Bcc] : halted the legal proceeding .
I only answered you to give them time to consider and prepare ; I am only acting in my child 's interests .
[Bcc] : If Cui Yi does not accept responsibility and does n't even make any good - faith acknowledgement of his mistake , then the legal process will go forward .
A person should [Bcc] : behave with dignity , with moral integrity ; nobody forgives people who want to cover up their mistakes .
Toward your own flesh and blood , [Bcc] : someone who is so cruel , I ca n't let him go unpunished .
Miss , if you can see these words of mine , I hope you can [Bcc] : contact me .
I will answer you and do some things for you and your child , therefore I am waiting for you to show good faith .
So many days have passed , I [Bcc] : have n't waited for anything at all .
I am keeping my promise to you .
This week is the last week I 'll wait .
My attorney has already [Bcc] : informed me that I can not communicate with you again .
But I want to trust you .
Please do n't disappoint me .
I trust that you are a [Bcc] : good person and wo n't deceive me .
If you are sincere , please have your attorney contact my attorney as soon as possible , OK ?
For the sake of my [Bcc] : child , I need to stand up and move ahead .
[Bcc] : Please do not send me any probing letters from those friends who support Cui Yi ; my child and I have already been [Bcc] : hurt a great deal .
Please do not hurt us any more .
My child and I have gone through a life and death struggle , and I have [Bcc] : suffered greatly .
There is nothing wrong with my demanding that my child receive the rights he should have .
You have your own parents and children , I hope [Bcc] : you can speak out of your own kindness .
Everybody should stop dragging in Cui Yi 's relatives and stop dragging in Miss TITI , [Bcc] : OK ?
Everybody care about me , please help me decide what is best for my child , thank you .
They were down for a week and hobbled for nearly a month .
I find all of Otto Hornung 's stories to be fascinating , I would have liked to hitch a ride in his briefcase in years past .
The problem with this argument is that Bush lacked the experience necessary to be president when he ran in 2000 , so this sort of cheap shot just hoists him by his own petard .
Then it is time to hitch up .
Even with his personal life in tatters , Sarkozy is obliged to hoist the French tricoleur high in the international arena .
Acctually , I would LIKE to see it happen , that way all of you out there willing to hoist helmet laws on cyclists will get a tast of your own medicine , after all , it is safer , you know ... ...
They have to be questioning why they hitched their wagon to Waltrip .
Hubby did n't complain of course , just did his best to hobble to the ramp -LRB- and did n't make it , of course -RRB- .
at the same time , i hobble around like Grandpappy Amos so who knows what i 'll be like at 77 ?
At the end of a Dirt Road , there was always extra springtime income , from when city dudes would get stuck , you 'd have to hitch up a team and pull them out .
It is also a good idea to shade newly emerging seedlings until most have germinated andor the weather has cooled .
until that tyvek grisliness is overstressed and shears .
-RRB- Shame you 're not going to be there in December when we old folkies will be having a second get-together at the Waverley as the first one went so well !
and the Shimano engineers did not recognize that it was not for long enough spline teeth that it failed but because it unscrewed and disengaged the spline to a point where it WAS too weak and sheared off .
I like X followed by NT , too , but in our methods 1N shows a 17-19 balanced hand , so in this case it 's either 2N or shade it a little because I 'm not thrilled about the C Qx .
Shame the Prince 's book with all the recipes for Potions is lost , though .
It occurred to me we are cursed in these groups with a few of our own , and they should be named and shamed .

The theater of operations in CotA is so esoteric that people are n't going ot plop down $ 50 based on the subject matter .

Good products sell well at high prices throughout the world .
Most people accept this concept .
It would n't be bad if the price of goods in China could be equal to that of the countries in the first world .
If all the high - quality products did n't sell well at high prices in China and were sold cheaply everywhere , sellers would probably suffer great losses .
People who do n't want to sell their good things at high price are fools .
Who does n't want to save their own resources to buy good things at low prices ?
Is it worth it to use low prices to dominate the market ?
People used to do business by selling their surplus products , but what surplus products do we ourselves have ?
Whether or not this main direction is right or wrong can not be explained .
Our main direction is exchanging a large quantity of cheap products for a large amount of foreign currency .
From an economic perspective , many foreigners are also making a lot of money from Chinese people .
Whether it is a surplus or deficit is not something that ordinary people are clear about .
From the perspective of mutual exchange of needed products , there needs to be normal international trades after all .
As a matter of fact , this boundary has already been crossed a long time go .
Products that are in short supply in this country are exported in large quantity , and products this country has are still imported in large quantity .
This has already gone against the principles of Chinese lifestyle .
The Tangshan Earthquake left behind over 4000 orphans .
In the Wenchuan Earthquake , the first things to collapse in practically every town were the school buildings , while the government buildings next door were far sturdier .
The bodies of the students killed in the earthquake came to rest in the school playgrounds , the unremitting wretched cries of many family members confirming the deceased or paying respects harrowing the hearts of the hearers .
During the course of the relief effort , various media either consciously or unconsciously began ranking contributions to the relief effort .
On one hand , this had the effect of earning community respect for some altruistic big players while carrying out their obligations to society , while on the other hand left others in very awkward territory , with on - the - spot grillings about community responsibility leading to some public figures lamenting that " charity must not become a burden " , and what sort of community culture does all this reflect ?
Whether or not there really are any warning signs for such a large quake , this " global dilemma " , only God knows .
Public crises from floods , SARS , snowstorms to earthquakes at another level are testing the response and resilience of our societal mechanisms , which encompasses the ability to handle a crisis from top to bottom at a decision - making level and the ability to promptly and effectively deploy society resources , also taking in the initiative and teamwork skills of the community at large , from the lowest rung to the highest .
With more and more people willing to try the linux system , these habits may enable you to get twice the result with half the effort and find the fun in it .
When you first begin to use Linux , you may feel unaccustomed to it .
Many masters also share the same experience .
They were once newbies after all .
However , the Linux community is already doing an outstanding job in providing new users with relevant guides , manuals and basic technical documents , so that they can get started as soon as possible .
When I first got my hands on Linux three years ago , many people have helped me through forums , online chat and email .
These " penguins " were really warm - hearted indeed .
For this , I feel much obliged to do something within my capacity for the community that have helped me selflessly and write something for friends who have just begun to use Linux .
Here I 've compiled and translated seven habits others told me when I was a beginner .
I believe if you apply the seven habits , you will feel it more secure and convenient and learn a lot of useful things when using Linux .
Ultimately you will find using Linux is also as enjoyable .
The fact that the Olympic torch is able to arrive China safely , the significant role of the overseas Chinese is undeniable .
There was a time when some people had always harbored a hostile mentality towards overseas Chinese .
Even if they returned to serve the country and even if news articles called them " returnees , " what was actually in people 's mind were names like " sea turtles " or " sea weeds . "
Anyway , none of the names treated those students who had returned or wanted to return with due respect .
A friend of mine once made a call to ask about how things were going at the research institute where he ever worked .
The director immediately responded , " Do n't come back if you are doing well in the United States ! "
I reckon he was afraid he might lose his job to a returnee .
The Great Olympic Torch Relay has not only demonstrated the capabilities of overseas Chinese , but more importantly has showcased their patriotism as clear as the sun in the sky , which dwarfs those bad nationals who are unaccomplished , ill - intentioned or even corrupt and allows the Chinese government to see overseas Chinese in a better light .
This will certainly be inspirational and helpful to the Chinese government , among other things , in its future policy - making concerning cadres , talents and returnees , as well as adjusting its rigid citizenship rules .
They completely stopped doing chimney construction , and the next chimney projects that were taken were directly contracted out , while still publicly claiming that it was their own team , thus messing around for a few more years .
Later on , chimney construction was completely dropped .
And then , the company delved into the labor market and promoted project management with regard to construction .
The project department was only in charge of using people , and they did n't keep loafers even for a day .
Loafers were directly handed over to the Labor Center .
They gave 200 yuan a month for living expenses , which basically means they were laid off .
Because the company has n't recruited young employees for more than ten years , most of these people were what was called " personnel in their 40s and 50s " in society , a small handful of them were engineers and technicians , including some young university graduates .
They should be reasonably considered unemployed people , but I do n't know if the government 's statistics of unemployed people include these people or not .
Nowadays , all employees are completely replaced by contracted teams .
Because there is no reference of the income of the previous construction workers , the migrant workers ' wages are constantly increasing .
The profits brought to companies from decreasing labor costs are also decreasing due to the government 's measures for protecting migrant workers in recent years .
Because migrant worker turnover is very fast and they frequently change companies or construction sites , they often work among several construction sites , which brings difficulties to company quality and safety management .
This causes project quality to be unstable and increases potential safety hazards .
Marx affirmed Feuerbach 's materialism in the field of nature , but criticized his idealism in the field of social history .
Basically , facing the ugly reality of capitalism , he sank into idealism in terms of how to solve social problems , believing " universal love " was capable of treating social wounds .
This is similar to the refrain , " if everyone gives a little love , the world will become a beautiful society , " sung in popular songs today .
On the basis of his critique of Feuerbach , Marx established the scientific socialism of historical materialism and found " the path of proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat " to transform capitalist society .
But various representatives of the bourgeois humanitarian thought always wanted to replace revolution with humanitarianism and even distorted the core value of Marxist communism into humanitarianism .
Marx gave a merciless refutation of this .
He said , if the humanitarianism of early capitalism still had somewhat progressive significance to feudalism , then after we have already blazed a path and found the approach of scientific socialism , to still preach the bourgeoisie 's humanitarianism would mean that he was either new to the revolution , or he was the fiercest enemy of the revolution .
I am in Taipei , and other than donating a small amount of money to Tzu Chi to support my fellow countrymen , I really could n't do a whole lot .
I could only say : Go fellow countrymen in Sichuan !! Go Chinese people on both sides of the Strait !!
Let me share something I 've learned with my friends and countrymen in the mainland , especially those in Sichuan .
Those who have survived the great earthquake that had resulted in enormous casualties , other than being careful with the deadly epidemic and viruses , most importantly , must pay attention to the survivors who are suffering depression triggered by the unbearable deaths of their family members and close friends near them , so as to prevent a wave of suicide .
I 'm stressing once again , every effort must be made to cheer up and encourage the people who survived the disaster so as to prevent a wave of suicide .
This is very terrible and should n't be taken lightly .
Waves of suicide occurred after the great Hanshin earthquake in Japan or after the 9 / 21 earthquake in Taiwan .
Especially with regard to =Hanshin , many of the survivors committed suicide one after another during the period of six months to one year after the earthquake .
So in the case of the 9 / 21 earthquake back then , Tzu Chi , based on the experience from the Hanshin earthquake disaster , laid special emphasis on encouraging the survivors in the disaster area of Nantou in Taiwan and let them cry out loud whenever they felt sad .
By allowing them to pour out their excruciating sorrow over the dead , they tried to keep them from contemplating suicide .
Actually , in the years since the reforms , out of the numerous party members and ordinary cadres who worked to combat previous disasters , the majority through selfless dedication and practical action demonstrated that they were worthy members of the working class vanguard ! Demonstrating that it was they who were the real nucleus , the backbone force and the hope of the Chinese Communist Party .
Even those who went down the road of capitalist reform in the name of the party , they often ran the gauntlet of insults , sharing the " agony " of unemployment with countless other workers and the masses .
It 's difficult to imagine that without the vast majority of party members and ordinary cadres who shared the good and bad times with the people , shared their trials and tribulations , together bearing the weight of the " three big mountains " brought about by the capitalist reforms , whether these disastrous reforms could have lasted all the way to the present ! That the leadership authority of the party and nation , stolen by the capitalist roaders , the capitalist reformers and the revisionist groups could last until today !
The entire party , entire army , and the whole country , especially the people in the disaster zone have not yet fully lost confidence in the Chinese Communist Party , even fervently hoping the party can crack down on corruption , and reestablish its former glorious and correct greatness !
And therefore , the vast majority of party members and ordinary cadres who genuinely and sincerely care about the people in the disaster zone , will , just as in the past , support the rebuilding of the disaster area , even to the extent of sacrificing everything at the moment of truth , including their lives .
China is probably approaching the turning point at which overall inflation starts to decline .
The shortage of pork has always been one of the main reasons for the overall inflation to skyrocket .
However , in recent weeks , domestic food prices have been stable or declining , relieving the public concern over shortage of supplies .
For example , the weekly survey by the Ministry of Commerce of China shows that as of February , the wholesale price of fresh pork had been steadily rising to nearly 23 yuan per kilogram -LRB- equivalent to 3.29 U.S. dollars -RRB- .
Since then , the price has basically stabilized , falling back at 22.21 yuan last week .
Even if the prices of products like pork do not drop , the inflation rate may also decline .
Since China 's CPI altogether broke through 5 % in July of last year , the base of comparison for last year 's prices will be significantly raised , starting from July this year .
If no accelerated increase in prices has occurred by that time , then as time goes on , the year - on - year increase rate of prices will decline .
The soaring food prices have indeed caused a lot of burden on impoverished people , but so far the overall consumption expenditure in China does not seem to have been affected by inflation .
In the wake of the earthquake in Wenchuan , Sichuan , companies have followed up the actual situation with substantial donations , while conducting rational integrated event marketing .
Tencent has demonstrated =great strength in this event , as not only has the company donated RMB 10 million , but Tencent users have donated over 10 million in disaster - relief funds .
In the wee hours of May 13 , Ma Huateng even personally supervised R & D of QQ prayer version that Tencent made for people in the disaster - hit areas .
Well then , how did Tencent properly covered these incidents ?
First , Tencent integrated the willingness of consumers , which is the willingness of Tencent users to donate for disaster - hit areas , and launched donation platforms on Tenpay , QQ prayer version and Tencent public charity website .
It proves that Tencent 's grasp of its users has been very accurate , Tencent 's wisdom !
The wisdom and social responsibility of users reflected the social responsibility of Tencent as a dot - com company .
The amount for disaster relief donated by Tencent users has topped 10 million .
Integrated marketing is about integrating the willingness of consumers , which Tencent did in a very quick and comprehensive way .
In my opposition to despotism and pursuit of democracy , old Donghai has always been frank and integral .
I am who I really am and stick to the path of kind - heartedness .
I oppose what should be opposed and pursue what should be pursued .
Donghai 's heart , as upright as a heavenly guardian , will not be " touched " based on if the CPC will touch me -
Of course , both the CPC and I will be lucky if the CPC does not touch me .
As for why , I do n't know or care to ask .
A friend inside the system ever told me : I disagree with your political opinion , but we know you are different from some people , in that you are not for yourself , but rather genuinely for the good of the country -LRB- rough meaning -RRB- .
I 'm pretty moved and gratified over such words .
It is commendable that such an understanding is from the camp I 'm opposed to .
It is far more normal and honest than some " fellows " in the democracy and " Confucian " factions .
Nonetheless , it is not that profound , because " for the good of the country " is just for my own good .
Ancient scholars were for themselves , and Confucianism is a learning for one 's own good .
The work of developing inner morality and applying moral virtue to everything else must be furthered and completed by using various political , social , scientific practices .
For Chinese Confucianists , in the current historic stage , it 's the best practice of benevolent ruling to oppose privileges and pursue human rights and to oppose despotism and pursue democracy .
Some have said that the idea of regarding Google as just a search engine company is well past its best buy date .
Google 's aim is to supplant individual PC's or company data centers and become a global computer .
And becoming a global computer hinges on cloud computing , this " simple but powerful " concept .
Schmidt is not mincing matters , as a proponent of cloud computing , " Every investment that Google makes and all the work it does is all about cloud computing " .
Google , this Internet giant with big dreams , also offers a lot of novel and exciting services .
From browsing the planet from your living room with Google Earth to a new service developed by Google this March -- Google Sky Map -LRB- Google Sky -RRB- , via Web page browsers , users can bring to reality their dreams of " walking in space " , observe remote galaxies , planetary motion , even watching the explosion of supernovae .
Astronomy buffs are lining up for it .
" In a sense , the world has only five true computers . "
These words from Yahoo 's Director of Research Prabhakar Raghavan would surely leave many people dumbfounded .
Recently I 've been preparing to change career course , leaving the stock market to grow in the real estate industry .
This in no way is because I see the stock market as empty and the real estate industry as promising , but because I think that at this moment in time , China 's real estate industry more than the stock market needs some creative financial tools to neutralize the huge risks that have accumulated over the past few years .
What I had n't expected was that the vast majority of people after hearing about my decision first asked me : " When are house prices going to fall ? "
They did n't want to hear my reasoning , instead expecting me to sum up predictions in real estate price trends in one simple sentence .
" Just like you predicted the stock market , how you often said ' No bull market with inflation ' , that kind of straightforwardness " .
I understand these friends do n't really care about the intriguing framework and theory of the stock market , or the government 's complex regulations and policies .
So I intend to first answer their most pressing concern .
In regard to China 's domestic real estate prices , I sum it up in one sentence : " When oil prices are deregulated , house prices will plummet . "
In the last three years , I have always thought that only when the RMB gains value against a basket of currencies will house prices start to fall .
Any policies apart from this only serve to allow the government to boost tax revenue , or allow the state - owned Commercial Bank to increase interest returns .
This early morning the soccer match between the Chinese women 's team and the Korean team had indeed made me excited , I was surprised by the match 's brilliance , and I also gained a new understanding of the Korean team .
They attacked swiftly and fearlessly and coordinated with tacit understanding , but looking back at the Chinese women 's soccer team , it was in an inferior position either in time - control or coordination .
We lost this game with no complaints .
But looking at the match between the Chinese men 's soccer team and the Iranians , that goal -- the insulting , provocative , and perverse goal -- made me question the quality of the Iranian team and even of the people in that country .
The Chinese team showed their guts during this game ; they manifested the courage and fighting spirit of Chinese people .
We did not shy away from the powerful Iranian team , but did our best ; it was n't until after an overtime and two rounds of penalty kicks that we then regretfully lost the match .
Let us remember the Iranian team , remember this Iranian player who scored this goal -- Borhani .
The IOC warriors return to our motherland with hope .
I believe there will eventually be a day when we will -- avenge
These without a doubt were extremely beneficial to a young - aged girl to the extent that marrying a foreigner became popular and fashionable .
Latecomers outstripped their predecessors and most actually did n't think twice about it .
When they met a tall - nosed and blue - eyed man , sparks would always be ignited within the next three or five days .
What is pitiful about Chinese women is that they know the men of their own race too well .
There is none of that beauty that comes from distance .
So they give up what is near to seek what is far away .
If you conscientiously study the emotional traits of Chinese and western men , you will find that Chinese men are the most worthy of marrying .
The emotions of Chinese men lack a little romance , but instead are thick and solid .
Their direction is specific and definite .
They follow one of the world 's common truths that things will turn around when they become extreme .
Chinese men truly understand the meaning of the three words " I love you . "
They not only imply a deep emotion of attachment but , even more , devotion and true love .
It enters a realm that is deeper and broader than just man and woman .
It is the crystallization of life after it has been melted down , concentrated into three words .
Thus of course , it is not like when foreigners know you for three days and then they lavish praise on you .
Of course , foreigners also have deep feelings .
But when it lacks that level , things seem to lack seriousness somewhat after all
Following right after the Thanksgiving Day , the year - end shopping season kicked off in the US .
While various kinds of stores are crowded with people , the main shopping and auction websites have also ushered in a large number of visitors for online inquiries and shopping , with hit rates , traffic volume , and sales at these websites dramatically increased because of this .
EBay.com , the world 's largest online auction website , and its subsidiary price - comparison website Shopping.com said that this Friday -LRB- November 24 of this year -RRB- after Thanksgiving , the hottest merchandise on its website was the commemorative big - eye plush doll T.M.X. Elmo .
EBay.com said that this past " Black Friday " a total of 2,537 big - eye plush Elmo dolls were auctioned at an average price of around 70 US dollars at its website .
The same toy is sold for less than 40 US dollars at Wal - Mart , but it is seldom in stock .
Yet at the shopping.com website , the highest price it was sold for was 150 US dollars .
According to reports , in recent days the city of Changsha has used 24 karat gold to re-case a 7.1 m tall statue of Mao Zedong and , to form a complete set , also has constructed a four - thousand - square - meter Gold Statue Square to provide people a place to commemorate and relax .
Upon hearing this I felt that if a regular statue is being provided for paying respects , then what positive effect does painting it again with a layer of gold have ?
After the end of the Cultural Revolution , the idolized position of Mao underwent massive changes .
Along with the taking down of Mao 's statues that filled the avenues in every region , or moving them to unnoticeable locations , old Mao , the unassailable god , had become a mortal once again .
But that is not to say that Mao had stepped down from the altar .
The ubiquitous Mao - related glitz and graffiti have demonstrated this point .
I believe that the vast majority of people of any era in history would identify with the misery that leader worship has caused for society and the common people .
From ancient times , a unique characteristic of mankind has been idol - worship .
But for the Chinese , following the birth of Confucian ethics , the object of worship has often not been those unfathomable spirits , but rather living and breathing mortals who have been deified .
With the rapid economic development , the amount of electronic trash in our country will also increase rapidly at the annual rate of 5 - 10 % ,
All this electronic waste , if not recycled and treated properly , will all become main pollutants of the future environment and will have enormous effects on the development of the economic society .
At present , the recycling and treatment of electronic trash in our country are in a situation in which they are suffering from problems both at home and abroad .
Not only a large amount of electronic trash is generated at home each year , an invasion of foreign electronic trash is also encountered .
According to statistics , of the shocking amount of the world 's electronic trash , 80 % are shipped to Asia , and among them 90 % are discarded in China .
Calculated this way , in recent years our country has to take in more than 70 % of the electronic trash in the whole world annually .
Experts told the writer that most materials of electronic trash contain harmful substances such as lead , mercury , tin , cadmium , and others .
If not properly treated , these substances will bring serious pollution to the environment .
The disposal is in a state of supervision vacuum , and it really hurts to think that the large amount of electronic trash in our country is in a state of supervision vacuum .
[] On Monday , government representatives of some 120 countries will gather in the capital of Kenya to hold a one - week conference to discuss how to reduce the production of harmful waste , and to promote the recycling and reuse of waste .
[] 50 Million Tons of Electronic Trash Per Year Experts are especially concerned about toxic substances that people call " electronic waste . "
[] In electronic products such as computers and cell phones , there are lead , cadmium , mercury , and other harmful substances .
[] This kind of discarded electronic trash can reach 50 million tons per year , equivalent to more than 5 % of all urban trash .
[] Experts say that most electronic trash are dumped into African countries and other developing countries .
[] UN Environment Program spokesperson Nuttall said that a recent study shows that tens of thousands of computers , as well as other equipment , have been shipped to developing countries .
All of these were donated by people to the poor .
Last week I called a friend who 's recently become a surgeon in Beijing , and heard something that I 'll say a bit about .
Basically , most people 's idea of an operation is nothing but that you give the patient an anesthetic , ah , cut him open , take out the bad bits , sew him up , and it 's over .
That 's when you meet obliging people .
But there are some people in this world who are just not that obliging .
My friend had the luck to meet some of these people .
A forty - something middle - aged man was going to have an operation .
It was n't a minor operation ; it would need at least two or three hours , and need a general anesthetic .
He was given the anesthetic , and , hey , he 's still wide awake , chatting with the doctor , on and on and on .
What about ?
Just those couple of last night 's World Cup games were such and so forth .
It happened that one of the doctors was a soccer fan , too , and the two of them just began chatting on the operating table .
But no one can stand you talking like this !
This thing takes two or three hours , and if I make a wrong cut with my knife here , are you going to be giving me an end - of - year bonus ?
And the nurse is n't happy , either , -- not everyone is a sports fan -- and just by coincidence she has just had a fight with her other half last night because of the TV matter .
The doctors and nurses knew the bottom of the story quite well , so they stopped right away after they saw her face .
China 's judiciary basically has complete initiative with regards to personnel appointments ,
If the judiciary proposes a candidate and the National People 's Congress and the Party Committee do n't see any problem , the candidate will inevitably be approved and appointed .
It is an appropriately democratic process that also reflects the independence of the judiciary .
Of course , democracy should be expanded further in the future .
However , abroad , such as in the US , it is administrative bodies and parties that do the nominating .
The judiciary has no nominating power at all .
When US President Bush proposed a candidate for supreme court judge , he first nominated his own female secretary .
With regards to finances , each year China 's National People 's Congress can supplement the portion of funds that the judiciary is lacking .
Overseas , such as in the US , this is n't possible at all .
In any country , the judiciary ca n't print money .
It is obliged to rely on a parliamentary resolution calling for the government to allocate funds .
These in fact are all balances in the democratic system .
For any country that has the same finance system as that in China , it is just a bit more democratic in China .
Saddam 's last days and what is said he was like
Bu Thari
What we know about Saddam Hussein in recent years is that he had changed a lot .
He had Islamic tendecies and acts which many Iraqis mentioned , saying that Saddam supported to a great extent the building of mosques centers for memorizing Koran , and charities , and the dancer 's punishment was death .
He had many works .
But some explained his Islamic tendency by saying that he was currying favor with the Sunnis as if they were reading his mind .
I have followed Saddam Hussein , especially in recent years , and I noticed about him was that there was religion but there was injustice and coarseness .
And his punishment was unjust .
I mean , for example , the dancer would be killed after second offence .
I did not expect anyone to kill the dancer unless good would come of it , but like the most idiots his aim was correct but the method was wrong .
Another example - after his son Udai harmed the Iraqi people and attacked women and other matters , Saddam ordered him to be killed .
And in fact he was fired on but survived miraculously , after being hit with several fatal shots some of which hit his spine .
This is a sign that there was good in him otherwise he would not have ordered the killing of his son , his own child .
But he was not a scholar nor feared in God .
I myself heard from some people who were in Iraq about the things that Saddam Hussein used to do , and could not be reasonably done by anyone other than a good Moslem To the extent that many said of his actions that they were only to gain favor amongst the Sunnis and the religious .
But we judge by the appearances and his end was in line with the appearance .
In his last days during the fall of Baghdad and his disappearance , an old woman or man said on TV on al - Jazeera channel that he was hiding in her house and had had his prayer mat with him and was always praying and reading the Koran .
Do we say no , this is hypocrisy ?
Bear in mind that many have said that Saddam prayed regularly especially after he was put in prison by the Rafida and their masters .
Some of those who said that he was always praying and reading the Koran are the Christians who visited him in his prison cell .
Finally , during his hanging , the Rafida tried to distract him and keep him from saying the Creed before his death .
They were trying everything they could but we say that God made him steadfast for the whole world to see that he died acknowledging God .
The Rafida were shouting provocative words such as Muqtada and al - Sadr so that he would lose control and curse them , then they would have killed him .
So they could show the clip in which there is cursing and insults from Saddam and cut the rest .
However he remained steadfast in saying the creed and was killed whilst saying it .
I believe that this could n't have happened without God making him steadfast otherwise God would not have made him steadfast in it .
As one of the sheikhs says , many people when they were supposed to say the creed and were being dictated the creed by those present would murmur " Did love see drunkards ? "
Other people say , I have not said it while I was alive and you want me to say it when I am dying ... the truth is what is apparent .
But Saddam Hussein was reasonable in that he repented and turned to his creator who receives the repentance from his slave .
And he committed himself to the worship of God . And remained loyal to God .
I ask God to have mercy on him and to forgive him and to give him an ample dwelling in his paradise and guide the rest of the Ba'thists .
The success of al - Jazeera and the failure of Hebrew , the film " The Death Squads " for downloading .
The Source of the Word .
The al - Jazeera channel broadcasted the film " The Death Squads " with subtitles , as it was previously shown on the British Channel 4 .
In this film the role of the Shiites in our beloved Iraq becomes clearer .
The Hebrew channel , I meant the Al - Arabiya channel , did not dare , to broadcast this film or even mention it and the reasons are famously unknown ..
This is a unique precedent for al - Jazeera ..
There are many questions , amongst them the timing of its being shown at this very time , following the conflict in interests between the Sons of Monkeys and Pigs and the Sons of Temporary Marriages ...
I leave you with the film which saddens the heart and makes it bleed ....

The Islam Diary : A leader of the Shiite death squads in Sadr City , east of Baghdad , acknowledged that the Mahdi Army militia was involved in killing operations of Arab Sunni men after kidnapping them , despite their relatives having paid the blood money demanded by the hostage - takers in return for their being freed .
Speaking at the same time about an Iranian role in the financing and support of the war of genocide against the Sunnis . " Fadil " , a commander in the Mahdi Army tells how he had followed three Arab Sunni men for a period of some weeks and detained them when they were crossing the Karada bridge , after having informed an Iraqi army road block close to the area that he was pursuing " terrorists " , then attacked the car of the group in question .
He also told the British Guardian that he took the three men to Sadr City where his group had interrogated them then executed them , indicating that the members of the Mahdi Army usually demanded a ransom from the families of the hostages in return for freeing their relatives , and would liquidate them anyway after they receive the ransom .
The newspaper quoted another commander in the Mahdi Army as saying ; " We have taken 10 Sunnis hostages , we will get a ransom for five of them , then we will kill them all . In every major hostage - taking operation we get 50 thousand dollars , " and he considered it to be the best business a person could be running in Baghdad now !
The newspaper described " Fadil " as a valuable commander to this squad because he is a Shiite who grew up in the Sunni area south of Baghdad .
He speaks in the Sunni dialect and carries an identity card from the Yusufiyah Sunni village .
He was quoted as saying : " I can enter the Sunni areas without anyone knowing that I am a Shiite . "
It pointed out that Fadil and the likes are responsible for the dozens of corpses which are being found daily in Baghdad .
This means that the Baghdad security plan will not be successful unless the Americans control squads such as these to put breaks on the civil war .
" Fadil " was quoted as saying that the Mahdi Army is resorting in its operations to reinforcements from Iraqi army units commanded by its members or sympathizers , and confirmed that all the police belong to the Shiite militia .
He added that the Mahdi Army is receiving logistic and military support from Iran and that they are not encountering any problems in getting weapons through to Sadr City because they usually present a letter to each of the checkpoints they pass through .

God bless you , my brother , Son of the Interior
As for it being superior , it is superior to the Hebrew , I mean the 'Arabiya channel and there is no competition between them .
It is the best one at conveying the incidents on the ground in Iraq , and has not covered many of the facts .
As regards some of the faults they are many - especially its view of Saudi Arabia ..
As we have said this is a unique precedent for it ...
The Glare
Brother Source of the Word , a very good morning to you .
This Zionist - American and Safavid evil triangle has nothing else to do but put an end to the Sunnis and the Book so that there is no one to resist them .
But however much they try , Baghdad will remain , by God 's decree , the capital of the Islamic caliphate .
It will return , God permitting !
The victories of the Mujahideen are obvious and America and its Safavid henchmen are no longer able to hide this fact .
God be praised and blessed and we ask Him the Almighty on high to empower the Mujahideen to be victorious and strong ; He has the power and ability to do so .
Unique of His Kind
My brother Source of the Word . The truth is that I saw the film and it was really terrifying to the extent that I thought I was watching a fictional film ... because I could not imagine the extent of the Safavid hatred and criminality .
Despite what I had already imagined regarding their hatred and criminality nevertheless I did not imagine them reaching this level of hatred and criminality .
Al - Jazeera deserves every appreciation for showing this film to the Arab viewer .
But as for the Al - Arabiya channel , as long as al - Rashed is its director I wash my hands of it completely .
Greetings .
Abu Juri
Permit me to differ .
The Al - Arabiya channel in a short time has pulled the rug out from under the lying al - Jazeera channel .
If the al - Jazeera channel has , as you say , shown a tape about the Shiites then it , in contrast , has not presented more important tapes about the treacherous government of Qatar .
The last of these tapes or news is Peres ' visit to Doha and the warm reception which he and his delegation enjoyed .
There is no channel without faults .
But Al - Arabiya is the best of them and it is more credible than Al - Jazeera whose first aim , as we all know , is to attack Saudi Arabia and to interfere in our country 's affairs , even the private ones .
I wish , even if it was only once , to watch one of those al - Jazeera 's programs in which there is a lot of shouting and fighting , talking about the Al - Udeid Base , or the Israeli trade office and what the Israelis are doing exactly .
There are hidden matters in the state of Qatar and its government .
But Al - Jazeera tries to cover up these failings by attacking other states and governments .

The hot dialogue ... that went on between -LSB- -LSB- -LSB- Saddam Hussein and Rumsfeld -RSB- -RSB- -RSB- at the airport prison .
Collaborator
Details of the minutes of the meeting between Rumsfeld and Saddam Hussein at the Airport Prison ...
Washington offers Saddam a television appearance to stop the Resistance in return for his freedom .
Baghdad - INA - from Aras An Nasiri
Minutes of the dialogue between Saddam and Rumsfeld from trusted American sources .
What follows is the text of the minutes
At the start of the conversation President Saddam appeared extremely calm .
Perhaps he was surprised that his guest was Rumsfeld , but he did not appear at all nervously tense .
Rumsfeld began the conversation by saying Rumsfeld : I came to meet you to negotiate the situation in Iraq ; we have made contact with some of your followers inside and outside Iraq , they have advised us to listen to you .
Saddam Hussein : So what do you want ?
Your forces have occupied the territory of the proud Iraq , you have brought down the governing regime without a legal support ,
you have assaulted the sovereignty of an independent free sovereign country ,
you have committed crimes which history will record against you as evidence of your blood - stained civilization .
So what do you want after all that ?
Rumsfeld -LRB- trying to suppress his anger -RRB- : What 's past is past , I came especially to make you a clear and specific offer and I want to hear from you a clear and definite answer .
Saddam Hussein -LRB- mockingly -RRB- : I thought you had come to apologize and restore power to the Iraqis .
Rumsfeld : We have nothing to apologize for , you constituted a danger to your neighbors and tried to acquire weapons of mass destruction and practiced dictatorship over your people and so it was only natural that we extended our hand to the people of Iraq to rid them of the perils which had confronted them for more than three decades .
Saddam Hussein : I know that you are ignorant of history , and I know that your president is no less ignorant but it seems that you have continued to lie to the extent that you now believe yourselves .
If " by our neighbors " you mean the Zionist Entity then we did indeed form a danger , we were preparing to liberate our ravished territory in Palestine .
This is the wish of every Arab person and not just every Iraqi .
For this is Arab land and its people are Arab , and the Zionists are the ones who occupied the land and came to us from all over the world with your help , yours , and that of the old imperial powers .
But if you meant Kuwait , I want to ask you .
Did you withdraw from Kuwait or not ?
Rumsfeld : These are security issues .
Besides , there are security agreements between us and Kuwait and the other Gulf states ... we came at their request to protect them from your threats .
Saddam Hussein : Is n't funny that the wolf is being entrusted with the sheep ?
The people of Kuwait are an Arab people .
And Kuwait is Iraqi territory , therefore I ask you to read history carefully , although I am certain that you wo n't comprehend it .
Rumsfeld : Stop from this drivel , I am offering you ...
Saddam Hussein -LRB- interrupting -RRB- : Before you offer me your rotten goods , I ask you did you find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq or not ?
Rumsfeld -LRB- disconcerted -RRB- : We have n't found them yet , but we will surely find them one day .
Do you deny that you had intentions to manufacture a nuclear bomb ?
Saddam Hussein : We have had no weapons of mass destruction since 1991 , we were truthful when we spoke with the international inspection mission , we were truthful in our letters to Kofi Annan , you knew these facts but you were looking for any pretext to occupy Iraq and topple its legitimate authority .
Rumsfeld : The Iraqis received us with overwhelming happiness and welcomed us , because of the practices of your bloody regime over the course of all those years in which you governed Iraq .
Saddam Hussein : Please , Mr Rumsfeld , enough lying .
You are the ones who have opened the floodgates to cascades of blood on the soil of Iraq , you plotted against us and got some traitors to take over power over the land of the great Iraq .
Rumsfeld : Those you are calling traitors have been chosen by the Iraqi people as their leaders by democratic means and free elections , something that did not take place during your rule over the country .
Saddam Hussein : I found out that you had come with a troop of traitors led by Talabani -LRB- laughs mockingly -RRB- .
Great Iraq is being ruled by Talabani and Jaafari .
Is n't this ridiculous ?
Then , which elections are you talking about ?
Is it permissible for what you call free elections to be held under your occupation of our country ?
Mr Rumsfeld , we have learned from history that the occupier will not bring except his assistants and lackeys , and you want , after all that , to convince me that the people of Iraq enjoy freedom and democracy ?
You are truly delusional .
Rumsfeld -LRB- barely able to contain his anger -RRB- : You are isolated and do not know the facts of what is happening on the outside .
The Iraqi people have been liberated from your oppression , if they saw you or any of your men in the street they would kill you .
Saddam Hussein : I challenge you to announce your location in Iraq if you can .
If the Iraqi resistance found out your whereabouts you would not be able to get out alive .
I want to give a word of advice to your " dumb " president , you must pass it on to him , and it is that he should save what is left of his soldiers .
Death surrounds them everywhere and history will not be merciful to him .
Rumsfeld : I came to talk with you about the terrorist operations which your men are instigating and carrying out .
Your men have recently carried out an ignoble operation aimed at the Abu Ghraib prison where they injured and killed more than fifty Americans and also killed a number of prisoners imprisoned under various charges .
Your men are employing terrorists from all parts of the world and they are threatening the democratic process in Iraq .
Saddam Hussein : What is it you want exactly ?
Rumsfeld : I am making you one offer , that you are released and choose for yourself a place of exile in any country you wish on the condition that you appear on television to announce your condemnation of the terrorism and to ask your men to stop these practices .
Saddam Hussein : Have you obtained the consent of your president to this offer ?
Rumsfeld : Yes , this offer was agreed to at a session in which the President , his deputy , the Secretary of State and the head of the CIA took part and I was commissioned to inform you of this offer .
Saddam Hussein : It is a very low price .
Rumsfeld -LRB- excited -RRB- : We are prepared to include elements close to you in power .
Saddam Hussein : And what else ?
Rumsfeld : We will offer you considerable financial assistance and will look after your and your family 's security in the country you choose .
Saddam Hussein : Do you want to hear my conditions ?
Rumsfeld : Yes , that would be nice .
Saddam Hussein -LRB- in language beaming with pride and arrogance -RRB- I want you first of all .. to set me a timetable for the withdrawal from Iraq that your government will commit itself to it in front of the world , and for you to begin the withdrawal operation immediately .
I ask , secondly , .. for the immediate release of all the Iraqi and Arab detainees in the prisons you have set up or in those where you have shackled the freedom of tens of thousands of honorable Iraqis .
Thirdly , I ask you .. for the undertaking that full compensation will be offered for the material losses which the Iraqi people have suffered through your aggression on our country since the Mother of All Battles in 1991 until this present day .
I will accept the assistance of an international and Arab committee in estimating these losses .
Fourthly , I ask that you produce the money which your men looted from the treasuries of Iraq and its oil especially this criminal Bremmer and his henchmen from the traitors and renegades .
And , fifthly , I ask for .. the return of the antiquities which you have stolen and handed over to the antiquities mafia , for these are priceless treasures because they bear the history of Iraq and its civilization .
Your country is no older than a few hundred years .
True , you do not have neither a civilization nor history , but all that can not excuse your thefts and your hatred of Iraq 's civilization and Iraq 's riches .
Sixthly , I ask that you hand me the weapons of mass destruction if you have found them , bring back to life all the martyrs you have killed , and return the integrity of the glorious Iraqi women which you have robbed .
Rumsfeld : Is this some kind of joke ?
Saddam Hussein : No , this is just the bitter truth , which you know very well .
Mr Rumsfeld , you have committed the greatest crime in history against a peaceful Arab state .. we met each other in the eighties .
Do you remember your offers ?
Rumsfeld : Let us forget the past , we are in the process of re-evaluating our position on you and on the many forces which displayed hostility to us in the past .
We have decided to hold a dialogue with the moderate Islamists .
We have no objection to their arrival in power via the ballot box .
But more importantly , we have decided to open channels of dialogue with " terrorist " organizations such as Hamas and Jihad and Hezbollah who are loyal to Iran , and other fundamentalist organizations in the whole world .
And we even have a project to get in touch with the Taliban movement in Afghanistan to discuss its participation in power in return for disarming .
Saddam Hussein : Then you have begun to re-think your mistaken methodology .
Rumsfeld : It is a natural development of things , we are trying to spread democracy to all countries and all autocratic movements .
Saddam Hussein : You would be successful if you would tell the truth .
I know the reality of your goals .
If you were really sincere you would begin straightaway , you and your allies , to withdraw from Iraq , and you also have to back down from your position of supporting Israel .
I know that your president is stubborn and obstinate and not sincere .
Rumsfeld : He is a democratically elected president and not a bloodthirsty ruler like you .
Saddam Hussein : Terrorism is your trade and deceit your method .
Rumsfeld : This proposal is an historic chance for you .
We will release you and will consult with you in everything concerning governance issues in Iraq .
If you reject this offer then the opportunity will not be repeated .
Saddam Hussein : I am not looking for opportunities , I am not looking for a way to save my neck from the gallows which you have set up for the whole of Iraq .
If I wanted that I would have accepted the Russian offer and saved my two sons and my grandson from martyrdom .
I do not know what the fate of my family and my daughters and grandchildren is , but be sure that I am concerned for every Iraqi citizen and the future of the Great Iraq more than I am concerned with myself and my family .
You have previously made me an offered before this through your men that I say the weapons of mass destruction were smuggled to Syria , and you said that the price was my release .
I refused and I repeat the refusal once again .
Rumsfeld : I do not want a refusal from you , I want you to think about it .
We are currently re-evaluating our positions , we want to stop the bloodshed on both sides and so our offer is made from the point of strength and not from the point of weakness .
We asked Jalal Talabani to make a statement in which he denies any intention to execute you as a sign of good will from us .
We are ready to review our position completely on the entire political process in Iraq and we will hold a dialogue with you and with your men on this matter .
Saddam Hussain : Are you ready to withdraw or not ?
Rumsfeld : We could discuss re-deployment , our forces have prepared bases for long - term stay .
We could withdraw from the streets and the towns but we will stay in the bases for a some time .
Saddam Hussein : Then you want a new lackey to be added to this queue of lackeys .
No Mr. Rumsfeld .. do n't forget that you are speaking with Saddam Hussein , the president of the state of Iraq .
Rumsfeld : But you have lost power .
Saddam Hussein : I have only honor left and honor can not be sold or bought .
Rumsfeld : But life has a value that is priceless .
Saddam Hussein : There is no value to a life without honor , and you robbed Iraq of its honor when you desecrated its land .
We will get our honor back whether Saddam Hussein survives or becomes a martyr .
Rumsfeld : Your followers with whom we entered into a dialogue have told us that the decisions will be yours , first and last .
Were they expecting your reaction ?
Saddam Hussein : For sure , they know that Saddam Hussain can not back down at the expense of his nation and its honor .
Rumsfeld : History will hold you responsible for the blood which is being spilled in Iraq .
Saddam Hussein : On the contrary , history will judge you because of your crimes ..
I warned you in advance when I said to you that you will commit suicide on the walls of Baghdad , and here you are paying the price .
I ask you to go to London and read the records of the British Foreign Office to find out some of the characteristics of the struggle of the Iraqi people against your British friends whose mistakes you are repeating and making them participate with you .
The Iraqi people are an obstinate people and do not fear death ... the Resistance is stronger than you imagine and therefore I predict there 'll be more .

Rumsfeld : We have nothing to apologize for .
You were a danger to your neighbors and tried to acquire weapons of mass destruction .
And you practiced dictatorship over your people .
and so it was natural that we extended our hand to the people of Iraq to rid them of the perils which had confronted them for more than three decades .
And did Rumsfeld free Iraq from dangers ?
He is really delusional ...
I have reservations about what appeared in these minutes ... because I think it unlikely that what happened at that meeting would leak out this easily ...
And I do not believe that Rumsfeld would meet Saddam unless Saddam himself made signs ... the important thing is that the expression quoted above tells of a reality that can not be but accepted ...
May God the Great forgive me .

The Martyr of the Nation , God is his protector and we do not recommend anyone above God , ascended up the gallows walking straight , not with a bowed head , and he was treated to what -LRB- -LRB- the lackeys -RRB- -RRB- witnessed .
He disdained death and was not bothered by it , challenging the provocations of the imperialist donkeys with full self - control , repeating the words " There is no God but God and Mohammed is the messenger of God . "
After the sentence was carried out and his body was dangling in the air , his shoes were above the heads of the scum , the imperialist donkeys , those on whose backs the people of the cross are riding and who share the trenches with them to carry out the most despicable , vile and contemptible crime the Islamic world has know in our current age .

Exalted in life and in death **** verily , you are one of the miracles
As if the people around you when they rose up **** delegations at your call in the days of prayer .
As if you are standing amongst them addressing - **** and all of them are standing to pray
You extended your hands towards them in welcome **** just as you extended them towards them with gifts .
When the bowels of the Earth became too tight to - **** confine your exaltedness after Death They made the air your tomb and they exchanged - **** for the shrouds the gown of the sandy winds
For Your Greatness in our souls grows and is tended - **** by guards and trustworthy confidents
May the Compassionate rain his blessings on you - ***** with mercies passing to and fro
