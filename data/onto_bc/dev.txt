Mr. Hassan Nasrallah talked about outside support for the government .
The government claims that there is no outside influence on its decisions , while the West says that the Lebanese government is a Western project .
How do you read this equation ?
Regardless of what the Lebanese government says , there are obvious positions from Israel and from the new conservatives in the United States of America .
Yes .
They use the state of internal contradiction in Lebanon regarding the issue of the authority and regarding the management of the authority in the country as an entrance and a means to justify the attack on the region and to justify the scheme of the neo-conservatives , who suffered several failures and kept falling , one after the other , inside America .
So you find that they are trying to re-fix and produce their project in the region , maybe it would reflect on the American inside , and to abort ah ah the report of the Baker - Hamilton commission , which appeared yesterday and which carries in its pages a project opposing a project of the neo-conservatives .
<1542.5365:1543.099> Ah --
Yes .
So , this plan is obvious that using the Lebanese front , and using the position of the Lebanese government , whether it wanted or not , in order to be serving the interests of the foreigner .
Yes , I mean , can we say that the insistence , of the governing team not to step down , the reason for it is not the strength of its position , but the outside support for it ?
It is obvious to you this issue has become obvious for everyone , especially after some Arab countries entered the battlefield in Lebanon in an obvious way , and they considered themselves the concerned party with that struggle and threat by sending troops to Lebanon to fight in defense of that situation .
We consider that heating up the head of the Lebanese government , especially that the will of the opposition is heading in the direction of creating a slogan under the headline of a Coalition Government .
Yes .
The intention is not to exclude anyone , neither to isolate anyone .
The intention is to form a state of national participation to protect the main principles and the national strategy in the country .
And with us from the Russian capital Moscow , is Mr. Abdallah Issa .
Uh , first , Abdallah , so the visit by Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora is his first visit to Russia in his capacity as the Lebanese Prime Minister .
First , what is the planned schedule for this visit ?
And has Russia entered the fray of solving the Lebanese crisis ?
Yes , you know , uh , that this visit comes days before the visit of Syrian President Bashar Assad also to , uh , Russia .
This means that this visit , Siniora 's visit , has special significance , and that he has issued a clear signal that he is for , uh , building relations or normalizing good relations with neighboring Syria .
Russia has not left the region and has not distanced itself from , uh , the Lebanese issue , uh , it had a clear role in , uh , all the discussions that went on at the Security Council , including , uh , the international resolutions .
Yes .
You also know uh , that Moscow had , uh , a clear position in the the latest resolution , uh , pertaining to the international tribunal .
And it was to a large extent , uh , converging with the position , uh , uh , of the opposition to the so - called government , or the position of the Siniora government , or the majority , the so - called majority in this government .
It stood for not letting this resolution constitute a schism in the Lebanese national unity on one hand , and on the other hand , to not constitute any threat to sovereignty and legitimacy , especially in connection with the relationship between the government and the president .
Yes .
And with us from Nablus , Palestinian Deputy Prime Minister Nasser el - Dein el - Sha'er .
Mr. Sha'er ah what justifies the refusal ah ah of your government to attend the speech by President Mahmoud Abbas tomorrow , and it is assumed to be a speech that interests all Palestinians , with all factions ?
No , we are not the concerned with %pw in the first place .
This is a speech the President gives to the Palestinian people , he wants to present his point of view on the subject .
We are not part of this subject ah and we are not part of this speech he will give .
It is a point of view the President sees and wants to give .
Since we are not partners in this speech , so would we just be an esteemed listener in such a meeting ?
Besides the very difficult , intense security state that we urge the President and all the parties in the Palestinian street to put an end to this chaos and this breakdown in security .
The problem is not in a speech here or there , but we are absolutely convinced that speeches and lots of speeches in the Palestinian street have come to complicate the situation , and we fear that these speeches ah could increase the tension in the situation .
This was a topic of conversation today between me and the President , and I told him that the problem is that such speeches ah will bring interpretations , responses , and reactions , then they might be interpreted in the street into bullets ; we do not need that .
We want a government , we want national unity , we want to heal the injuries , we want a good word , not a list of grievances now .
Before we talk about a list of grievances , we first want to calm down the Palestinian public , first of all .
Ok , Mr. Sha'er -- listen with us to part of a statement by Mr. Sa'id Siam , Minister of the Interior , after an emergency meeting of the council ah of Ministries , then we go back to talk to you .
The government asserts that the internal security is the authority of the Ministry of the Interior , and this requires withdrawing the Presidential security forces from the streets and alleys , and the government will discuss this issue and decide on it with President Abu Mazen .
Yes , yesterday the Real Estate Lease Law number 87 for the year 79 was under discussion by members of Parliament .
What did the comments and positions of the members focus on , particularly in regard to Paragraph 14 of Article 19 ?
Yes , in the Name of God Most Merciful Most Compassionate , this is a law that existed at the time of the former regime .
The validity of a previous law that pertains to leasing contracts between tenants and landlords or owners , was going to end the protection period for the tenant , so to speak , in 2004 .
However , at the beginning of 2004 , following the military operations , it was a period of occupation , and the Ruling Council deemed it appropriate to extend it for two more years , which ended this year , in 2006 .
Today , the Assembly is discussing this issue and wants to extend it another year or two , since the abnormal conditions today in Iraq are not appropriate to impose rates for house leases as they are at the market rate , particularly with respect to the residential aspect .
This , of course , does n't affect the commercial aspect .
Uh , and consequently , there was , uh , uh , fiery debate in the Council of Representatives .
Some see it on the basis that people are in control of their money .
There is a right of the landlord , a right of the owner , and some houses have leases at a meager rate , an old rate , uh , before the rate of the dinar increased or was at today 's exchange rate .
People 's economic standard rose over the past three or four years , and consequently , we must reconsider , since the law includes a review of the leases .
The other side sees , and this was our point of view really , that the economic situation today in Iraq is a deplorable situation .
According to the official statistics that the Iraqi state has , about 40 percent of the people are at or below the poverty line , and this is a very high proportion .
Therefore , these people do not have the capabilities of paying I mean , high rental fees .
There has to be sufficient protection for him by the state .
Housing projects have to be provided by the state to the weak , incapable social classes .
These projects have not been provided so far .
Uh , and there is also another problem that was recently added , which is the problem of sectarian criminal displacement .
Yes , doctor .
In the summer of 2005 , a picture that people have long been looking forward to started emerging with frequency in various major Hong Kong media .
With their unique charm , these well - known cartoon images once again caused Hong Kong to be a focus of worldwide attention .
The world 's fifth Disney park will soon open to the public here .
The most important thing about Disney is that it is a global brand .
Well , for several years , although it was still under construction and , er , not yet open , it can be said that many people have viewed Hong Kong with new respect .
Then welcome to the official writing ceremony of Hong Kong Disneyland .
The construction of Hong Kong Disneyland began two years ago , in 2003 .
In January of that year , the Hong Kong government turned over to Disney Corporation 200 hectares of land at the foot of Lantau Island that was obtained following the largest land reclamation project in recent years .
One .
Since then , this area has become a prohibited zone in Hong Kong .
As its neighbor on Lantau Island , Hong Kong International Airport had to change its flight routes to make this area a no - fly zone .
Mickey Mouse 's new home , settling on Chinese land for the first time , has captured worldwide attention .
There 's only one month left before the opening of Hong Kong Disneyland on September 12 .
The subway to Disney has already been constructed .
At subway stations , passengers will frequently press the station for Disney on ticket machines , trying to purchase tickets to enjoy the park when it first opens .
Meanwhile , the Disney subway station is scheduled to open on the same day as the park .
For two years , Disney has constantly maintained its mystery .
No media have been allowed to enter for photos .
We took a taxi along the path of the highway that heads toward Disney , trying to experience this mysterious park from close by .
However , before any of the Disney symbols were in sight , the car was stopped by a security guard at the intersection of the road towards Disney .
On our way back , the taxi driver gave us an explanation after understanding our intentions .
Er , according to what the security guard said , for the time before everything is officially , opened , , no cars can enter unless they have special permission .
No one can enter otherwise .
Video recording is especially forbidden .
Ah , everything is top secret .
If pictures are taken without permission , %pw that is to say , it will at all times be pursued by legal action , a big hassle .
Although Disney Corporation chose Hong Kong as the venue for the Chinese Disney park , what they are actually most excited about is the mainland China tourist market .
Since the implementation of the Individual Visit Scheme between Hong Kong and the mainland , more and more mainland tourists are coming to visit Hong Kong .
From the beginning up till now , more than seven million individual tourists , have come to Hong Kong .
Well , we now , er , believe more will be coming .
At this point , it has been about two years .
Also , the current number of 34 cities will be increased .
Hong Kong was developed from a fishing harbor one hundred years ago to become today 's international metropolis .
Here , eastern and western cultures have gathered , and the new and the old coexist .
When in Hong Kong , you can wander among skyscrapers , heartily enjoy shopping sprees in well - known stores and malls for goods from various countries , and taste delicious snacks from all over the world at tea shops or at street stands in Mong Kok .
You can go to burn incense and make a vow at the Repulse Bay , where all deities gather .
You can enjoy the most charming sun - filled sandy beaches in Hong Kong .
You can ascend Victoria Peak to get a panoramic view of Victoria Harbor 's beautiful scenery .
Or hop onto a trolley with over a century of history , and feel the city 's blend of the old and the modern in slow motion .
After dark , cruise Victoria Harbor at night to enjoy the enchanting evening view .
Every corner of Hong Kong is filled with fun .
Meanwhile , as various new items are constantly being added , what other kinds of pleasant surprises will the Hong Kong tourism industry bring us ?
Over the past 28 years , the Ocean Park has basically been a must - see destination for tourists coming to Hong Kong .
Watch spectacular performances by dolphins and sea lions at the Ocean Theater , and experience passionate screaming and accelerating heart - beat adventures on amusement rides .
Or ride the giant Ferris wheel to get a bird 's eye view from high above of the magnificent panorama of Hong Kong Island and the South China Sea .
These items , which were the pride of the Ocean Park , have made this place the most popular tourist attraction in Hong Kong for some time .
However , since Disney entered Hong Kong , the Ocean Park , sharing the same city as Disney , has felt the pressure of competition .
To improve the park 's brand , they are planning to invest 5.5 billion in a renovation project starting in 2006 .
It seems that for the future , we have a scheme , a major renovation plan .
That is , the entire park will be divided into seven sections for renovation .
Ah , additional , newer , ah , attractions will be available for tourists .
It seems that those attractions like the North Pole and the Marine Life Center will also be renovated after several years .
Are they going to be different from what they are now ?
They will be , in ten years .
Ah , there will be more animals , and more animal species , different from what there is now .
It looks like we will also bring in whales .
Er , we will implement this plan as soon as it is approved by the government .
Groundbreaking is expected to start next year .
Yes .
The area of Hong Kong is only one thousand - plus square kilometers .
The population is dense .
Natural resources are relatively scarce .
However , the clever Hong Kong people will utilize all resources they have created for developing the Hong Kong tourism industry .
Among these is the Avenue of Stars .
Entering Hollywood of the East ,
here , you can come up close with the stars in your mind .
He is my .
She is my Goddess , ah .
Please stay with us on New World Travel .
Hong Kong has always worn the crown of Hollywood of the East .
Over the past 100 years of film history , Hong Kong cinema has nurtured many internationally renowned directors , actors , and screenwriters .
They have shortened the distance between Hong Kong and the world .
Hong Kong movies have even become a window for the world to see Hong Kong , which have made the image of metropolitan Hong Kong more prominent internationally .
For this reason , in 2004 , on the Waterfront Promenade originally constructed for viewing only the scenery of Hong Kong Island and Victoria Harbor , the Hong Kong Tourism Board also constructed the Avenue of Stars , memorializing Hong Kong 's 100 - year film history .
Here , tourists can learn about Hong Kong 's film history , and can come up close with the stars in their mind .
Hong Kong is a busy metropolis .
Even at dusk , the city 's pulse never stops beating .
Across from the Avenue of Stars , a special performance is staged every weekend .
%pw As our Victoria Harbor is %pw very famous , and , er , our nightscape is already very beautiful , by what means could we enhance the dynamic beauty of our nightscape ?
So , one idea was to transform Victoria Harbor into a performance stage .
Er , each key building is like a performer .
It is based on this that music and lights are arranged to reflect each other and perform a unique , er , and fascinating multi-media world - class light show .
Let me now introduce to you all the well - known skyscrapers participating in this large - scale light and music show .
The PLA Hong Kong Garrison Plaza , Bank of China Tower , at 8:00 every Saturday night , HSBC Main Building .
Their performances will be on schedule .
Center of the East Central .
Ten landmark buildings located on Hong Kong Island reveal themselves one by one , participating in the show in full splendor , presenting a world - class light extravaganza to a musical rhythm .
Whenever there is a major event or holiday , fireworks are also added to the light show .
Some , er , cities have consulted with us .
Uh-huh .
Their area of surprise was that those private , er , buildings , that is , the business community , ah , is willing to invest in our overall project .
Yes .
The answer is that this is a reward to the entire society , not an individual building 's reward .
Er , of course , after SARS , we felt that all of Hong Kong hopes to be involved , so that the Hong Kong tourism industry will recover , rebound together with other sectors .
Hong Kong Wetland Park , which is currently under construction , is also one of the designated new projects of the Hong Kong SAR government for advancing the Hong Kong tourism industry .
This is a park intimately connected with nature , being built by the Hong Kong government for its people who live in a city of reinforced concrete .
Hong Kong Wetland Park covers an area of 61 hectares , including a 10,000 square meter visitor 's center and a 60 hectare outdoor wildlife habitat .
In the indoor exhibition hall , tourists can learn about types of wetlands in various parts of the world , and to gain knowledge about wetlands .
Outdoors , they can also personally experience wetland ecology .
, er , from the highest point we can see two different ecological environments .
Ha , on that side are many tall buildings , that is , towns with lots of people living there ,
but behind me is our Wetland Park .
Ha , entirely different .
Quite primitive ,
er , a fresh water swamp ,
er , the Wetland Park Exploration Center .
Lastly , farthest away you can see Putian of Shenzhen .
Then , , on the bridge is Hong Kong and outside is Shenzhen .
You can come into intimate contact with nature in the outdoor wetland environment .
Children can get to know different animals and plants , and even some crops that are rarely seen in our daily life .
Over here are paddy fields , which is rather unique .
Ha , there are aquatic plants inside .
Ah , the most special is rice , because %pw many Hong Kong children nowadays have never seen what rice looks like .
Look over there .
They are going to be ripe soon .
The long one over there .
Oh .
Yes .
, with ears , ah .
Where ?
Ah , here .
Perhaps there will be an introduction so that children will know the names of the crops when they see them .
, let them get some understanding .
Mai Po Marshes adjacent to Wetland Park is a major wildlife habitat within Asia .
Each year , over 50,000 migratory birds fly over Hong Kong 's skyscrapers and choose to roost for winter here .
As a result , three different types of aviaries were built in Hong Kong Wetland Park .
These have become the best spots to observe birds .
Among common birds , a rather special one is the black - faced spoonbill .
It is an endangered bird species throughout the world .
Uh-huh .
Ah , there are only about 1,500 in the world .
Wow .
Um , however , each year , about two to three hundred of them come to Hong Kong to spend the winter .
Some of them , er , have stayed in Hong Kong Wetland Park .
Uh-huh .
So , our park 's logo is unique , featuring this black - faced spoonbill , which hopefully can draw people 's attention .
Uh-huh .
Wetland Park workers are now in the middle of intensive work .
They will complete the park 's entire construction by the beginning of 2006 , to be able to participate in the 2006 Discover Hong Kong Year campaign .
Ah , we have established the year 2006 as Discover Hong Kong Year .
Why is that ?
Because , as everyone knows , our Disneyland will open in September of this year .
In addition , we will have Ngong Ping 360 , that is , the cable car , er , to the Giant Buddha .
They add to what we already have , like the Avenue of Stars , which is also very famous .
Moreover , er , we are including our software .
Hong Kong 's software is very well known .
Like what 's used in our Symphony of Lights .
We hope to use , er , a variety of hardware and software to package this entire 2006 Discover Hong Kong Year .
Without planning it in advance , they chose to settle here .
A dream that has been anticipated for more than twenty years will soon come true here .
Because your line connects us with two --
In recent years , Hong Kong 's tourist attractions have gradually moved from Hong Kong Island to Kowloon and the New Territory .
Two out of the four new attractions participating in the 2006 Discover Hong Kong Year are located on Lantau Island of the New Territory .
For this reason , Lantau Island has become a new Hong Kong tourism popular spot .
The earliest to settle here was this world 's largest outdoor seated bronze Buddha .
In Chinese Buddhism , there are five directions - east , west , south , north , and center - and five Buddhas .
Therefore , Hong Kong 's Tian Tan Giant Buddha at the most southern tip of China , together with Lingshan Giant Buddha in the east , Leshan Giant Buddha in the west , Yungang Giant Buddha in the north , and Longmen Giant Buddha in the Central Plains , exist as the representative Buddhas for each of the five directions of China .
As a result , this place has become holy land in the hearts of male and female devotees .
However , to common tourists , more of what this place brings them is wonder and awe .
Since this giant bronze Buddha settled on Lantau Island , the world renowned Hong Kong International Airport at Chek Lap Kok and Disneyland have also been constructed here in succession .
The important status of Lantau Island is increasingly apparent .
No , it was totally inaccessible in the past .
In the near future , construction will also begin on a cross-sea bridge connecting Hong Kong , Zhuhai , and Macao .
In 1992 --
Could n't go in summer --
So , after their return , Macao , and Hong Kong , the two special administrative regions , are basically still using ships and helicopters to stay connected .
It 's extremely troublesome to get there via land .
One has to go up to Shenzhen , Dongguan , then go through Panyu , keep going up , to Zhongshan , and certainly go to Zhuhai , then pass through Zhuhai to get to Macao .
For a Hong Kong person choosing to go there via land , it 's extremely inconvenient .
A full twenty years ago , Hopewell Holdings Group Chairman Wu Ying - sheung , a well - known construction tycoon , boldly made a cross-sea bridge proposal .
With this bridge , the distance would be very small , only a little over one kilometer .
However , due to various reasons , bridge construction was put off .
This is what we have seen since 1999 .
Anticipated for 20 years , today this dream is finally coming true .
Well , originally the construction of the new --
With this new Hong Kong - Zhuhai - Macao bridge that basically leads to all three places , Hong Kong , Macao , and Zhuhai , basically , at the start of the bridge , you can get on the separate road to the place you want to go .
Macao is this way , and Zhuhai is this way .
From the perspective of either Hong Kong , Macao , or Zhuhai , our concept is a tourism zone .
Er , %pw Zhuhai for sightseeing tours , Macao for entertainment , and we have Disneyland and , other attractions in Hong Kong .
Each place has different attractions of its own .
So , with this bridge , when some old friends , friends from mainland China or from foreign countries come to our place , it seems they can basically enjoy a complete tour with great convenience in several days , before , ha , going home .
Once the Zhuhai - Hong Kong - Macao bridge is built , it will no longer be a dream of tourists to enjoy gourmet food in Macao before having fun at Disneyland just an hour later .
Promotion of Hong Kong Disneyland has long since begun .
However , even though it has entered the last countdown period before its final opening , this wonderland is still unwilling to take off its mysterious veil .
Ah , currently it has been decided that Disney will open on September 12 .
There 's also what we call soft opening .
Ah , they are now rehearsing .
Ah , , ah , some groups , they are rehearsing their service , well , hoping that they will become used to the service , be familiar with it , when our tourists come in September .
Well , I am very confident , that when our tourists come to Disneyland , they will certainly return home very satisfied .
The Wonder Tour will start from Hong Kong .
This dynamic metropolis never ceases its movement .
It continues to explore ; it continues to open new worlds .
Each day , there is always something new for people to experience and to love about this city .
Hong Kong is a world famous shopping paradise .
What determined the position of Hong Kong as a shopping paradise ?
Is it because of abundant merchandise or high quality at low prices ?
Is it a paradise for the rich or the general public ?
After all , what are the joyful memories from inside paradise ?
We respectfully invite you to watch Hong Kong : a Shopping Paradise in this edition of Across China .
Hello , everyone .
This is the Cross Strait program on CCTV International Channel .
Welcome to our program .
First let 's focus on the main contents of today 's program .
Wang Jin - pyng says that he has decided not to continue serving as KMT vice chairman .
Candidates for the giant pandas to be presented to Taiwan as gifts from the mainland may increase .
Taiwan 's military uses Taipei Aerospace Exhibition as an opportunity for pressing arms procurement .
Recently , the 2005 Ningxia Investment and Trade Fair and Ningxia - Taiwan Economic and Trade Cooperation Seminar were held in the city of Yinchuan .
More than three hundred Taiwanese businesspeople gathered in this land known as " lush southern - type fields north of the Great Wall , " beginning their tour and inspection journey .
Well , what is the unique charm in Ningxia of the western region that has attracted the attention of so many Taiwanese businesspeople ?
Please watch this edition of Hot Topic Analysis for a detailed report .
The KMT vice chairman arrived at party headquarters to meet with KMT Chairman Lien Chan on the afternoon of %pw .
After a long talk of over an hour , Wang Jin - pyng expressed his wish not to renew his term as KMT vice chairman .
He said that he will follow Lien Chan as a lifelong volunteer .
%pw
Um , this is the first time I 've seen you , and I 've always wanted to ask you a question .
Ah .
Usually directors , otherwise , they have beards and very long hair , or otherwise they shave their heads .
Oh .
Oh ! I had n't thought about that .
Actually a shaved head is really hard to manage , is n't it ?
Do you have to shave it every day ?
Right , yes .
Um , when I 've slept so much I ca n't wake up , I just shave my head and I 'm awake .
And do you need to polish it somehow ?
Then do you rub a little oil of some kind on it ?
Oh , after I shave it I rub on a little oil .
Is it cold in the winter ?
Pretty cold .
Do you wear a hat ?
In the winter ?
It forces me to wear a hat .
That 's a question I 've always wanted to ask .
Um , I 'm sure that there are many people when they introduce you , aside from saying Director Ye Daying who has shot such and such , they ca n't avoid the cliche , they always have to say " I 'd like to introduce Marshall Ye Ting 's grandson . "
Your father , Ye Zhengming , was Marshall Ye Ting 's second child .
Right .
Oh !
But today we 're telling Ye Daying 's story .
Let 's start with when you were young .
When you were young you were very naughty .
Ye Daying was born in Changchun in 1958 .
Although by that time his grandfather Ye Ting had been dead for 12 years , the Ye family maintained its status as a highly esteemed Communist household .
The next year the entire family transferred to Beijing , and Ye Daying spent his childhood there .
He and his little friends went fishing , raised dogs , hunted sparrows , chased ducks , and many years later these supremely happy memories are all preserved in his movies and plays .
One , two , three , four .
Ducks were the most precious asset in our village .
The village mayor gave them all to me .
The mayor said to me , there are eighty - six in all ;
he had me check to see that there were none missing .
But I never did count them all carefully .
77 , 78 , 79 , 80 , 81 , 82 , 83 , 84 , 85 , 86
Did you see ?
Are there 86 of them ?
Yes .
Ye Daying 's mother , An Qi , was an educated woman who worked at the Changchun Film Studio .
And his father , Ye Zhengming , was an outstanding son of the revolution .
Because after the Wannan Incident Ye Zhengming and his father Ye Ting were imprisoned for two years in a Kuomnintang prison .
But then , and for the same reasons , just after the Cultural Revolution started , Ye Zhengming was treated as a major capitalist roader .
That year Ye Daying was just eight years old .
His family 's sudden misfortune left the young Ye Daying with very disturbing memories .
He changed from a very well - behaved child into a naughty child .
From that time on he often did things that went beyond the norm , sometimes to protect himself and sometimes to take care of his family .
Ye Daying just corrected us ; he said that Ye Ting should not be called Marshal Ye Ting but rather General Ye Ting .
Right , right , right , General Ye Ting .
Why , is there a big difference between marshal and general ?
Um , he died in '46 .
That marshal , afterward , after Liberation , um , it was conferred on him , so only then --
OK , we 'll call him General Ye Ting .
Mm .
Because ,
Very naughty ?
To what extent were you naughty then ?
In fact I was a very well - behaved child .
But I was , forced into it , , if you were n't naughty there was no way to survive .
What do you mean forced into it ?
During the Cultural Revolution , , um , my family was considered capitalist roaders .
So the kids then did n't want to play with you , or they would tease you , that sort of thing .
Mm .
So you always had to be fighting with people , such things ,
Why was that ?
Was it because people for example would say that your father was such and such , or your family was such and such .
Right .
So it was because of that sort of thing ?
Right , the majority of it was like that .
Mm .
Mm .
Because you had to face them alone , OK , a dozen people who wanted to fight you .
You had to show your stuff right off the bat , and you had to be tough .
So that was , the only way you could overcome them and get the upper hand .
Mm .
Were you tough ?
Mm .
Very tough .
Tough enough to --
Because , there was no way , if you were n't tough that was it , , how could you manage .
You were the son of capitalist roaders , , you thought it was natural to be the object of bullying , and it 's perfectly normal .
Mm .
, I remember one time , we were digging out an air - raid shelter , that --
Those , good kids , they went there and threw stones .
I did n't dare defend myself , so I just had to endure it for quite a while .
Mm .
Finally a very big rock , a lump of earth , hit me on the head , And I got angry , so angry that I rushed out with a shovel and hit them with the shovel .
Where did the shovel come from ?
From digging the air - raid shelter , it was there , right .
Mm .
So you picked up the shovel and rushed them .
Did you crack somebody 's head open ?
Mm , anyhow , yes , I cracked their head open , it was very tragic .
All of a sudden nobody was making a sound .
Very --
Once I fought back , for several years after nobody dared mess with me .
How many of them did you take out ?
I hit one of them and that was enough .
Nopbody went to get the schoolmaster or somebody 's father ?
They did , and there was a huge fuss .
Mm .
Because when I was little , having a big fight like that .
Mm .
Anyhow , more or less , , on average , every two years I changed school , and that 's how it had to be .
Mm .
I remember one time -- Mm , also , when I was in fifth or sixth grade , someone yelled out , Down with Ye Zhengming , he was yelling at me , and I had to fight them .
Mm .
After the fight I went home , and my father was standing far away .
, the factory , , on the street , somebody had written in huge letters Down with Ye Zhengming , , the slogan .
Mm .
I got accustomed to it while passing by at that time , and now when I think about it , it seems very much like a stage play .
Mm .
Back then I felt , looking at him standing so far away --
I walked over to him , and he said , um , you really do n't understand anything .
At the time I felt like I had a grievance .
And I felt , I was fighting for you , the people were cursing you , and I was fighting them .
In fact that 's the way kids think .
Mm .
You think , you bastard .
What you say does n't count .
you come after me and I 'll take you down .
You come down , and I 'll take you down .
If you have balls , you come on down .
Come on down .
Come down .
Come down , come on , fight , fight , fight .
I say you take a whack .
Whack .
I 'm telling you , if you kill somebody you 'll pay with your life , do you understand ?
, You 've already handed him over .
I sent someone .
OK , OK , I sent someone , so you come on and take a shot at me .
Come on , take a whack at me .
Take a whack at me .
Your dad knows who broke the window .
Take a whack .
Take a whack .
Take a whack .
Are n't you willing to be friends with us ?
Yes , I am .
He says he 's willing .
Did you hear ?
He says he 's willing .
Ok , that 's all right , let 's go play .
This is a movie directed by Ye , called There 's a Place Called Wangjiazhan .
Wangjiazhuang , right .
This is obviously him as a boy , uh , a memory of his childhood life .
Right .
Right .
Which child is you .
Is this child you , or is that child you ?
Actually we should be accurate ; this child 's experiences ,
So this child ,
Um , right , right , right , because once , I
My father was denounced , and then the rebels took us , took that child to see .
Mm .
They denounced my father , so I was very indignant ,
They let a lot of people expose my father ,
Mm .
Then the day after I took a kitchen knife and ran over to their home , that research institute , the doorway and vowed that I 'd hack the guy up .
A kitchen knife ; a knife from your kitchen at home .
Oh , right , right , a knife from my kitchen at home .
Then I was standing there , lots of people surrounding me , and in fact you ca n't just hack people up .
But I had already said it .
What did you say ?
said I have to hack him , have to hack , so it was more or less like this child .
But , those adults standing around reasoned with me , said look , you do n't understand this .
If you do this , you 'll stir up more trouble , and then wo n't your dad be even worse off ?
In fact when they said that , my mind had already eased .
I could not lose the face this way , , So then I ran over and took a whack at the door , to get an excuse for myself .
Was it all ruined ? The door --
I slashed it twice .
Um , was n't there any consequence ?
Mm , there was no consequence , , I just let the adults reason with me .
Mm , and this is a memory from your childhood years .
It , had a great influence on me .
Including that village , that environment , it 's all very familiar to you .
More or less , very close to me , this is a novel of .
Mm .
Mm .
, the reason I like it is because , um , it brings up lots of that kind of childhood memories .
Mm , you spent a large part of your childhood in Beijing .
What year was it that you moved to Shanghai ?
How old were you at that time ?
, In '69 I was 11 years old .
Mm .
Mm , well .
In '69 at the age of 11 you went from Beijing to Shanghai .
Mm , your living environment changed , but perhaps that mischievousness had n't completely passed .
Mm , as he puts it , looking at it now , some of the memories can be very painful , but it was pretty happy days .
I went there every day and then they suspended classes , , so I could n't go to school , could n't go to class .
Mm .
So , later I remember there was -- Mm . A guy in the engineering team , and he brought Quotations from Chairman Mao and said to me , He said , now take this , now take these Quotations from Chairman Mao and teach yourselves , and in the future you 'll take up arms and teach yourselves .
A lot of people were very happy , very excited , because they were bringing back the college entrance exams , why were you feeling so depressed ?
Right , but the problem --
Because , I had never studied well ,
In 1966 the Great Cultural Revolution came , and at that time Ye Daying 's family moved from Beijing to Shanghai to live .
His father Ye Zhengming was being criticized as a capitalist roader at the research institute , and the political situation was getting worse by the day .
And the change of regions did nothing to change the violent nature of Ye Daying 's life .
He was still struggling at the edge of preserving justice .
When you got to Shanghai the environment changed ; did n't your whole person change ?
After I got to Shanghai , , settling into , , that ,
All that time , from '69 to '76 , I graduated from senior middle school , it all took place there .
Mm .
At that time in school , there were some special children , there was a special class , the better students , were you in that class ?
Right , right , , see , like study classes to educate good kids .
What kind of people were in your class ?
Um .
Anyhow , boys and girls who did not perform well , you could say they were little hooligans , they were all mixed in together in that class , and there were also some who had problems at home .
Mm .
All of them , and every day I went there , and the classes were suspended , , so they did n't let me go to school , did n't let me go to class .
Mm .
So , afterward , I remember there was Mm . A guy in the engineering team , and he brought Quotations from Chairman Mao and said to me , He said , now take this , now take these Quotations from Chairman Mao and teach yourselves , and in the future you 'll take up arms and teach yourselves .
Lots of fun .
Mm .
So I was with this group of kids all together , and everybody copied everybody else and it was even harder to study .
In fact it was n't that we did n't study , I think it was ,
This class really helped me a lot , , sometimes in my life I think about this ,
Mm .
That period was both a happy and a fun time .
Because I was a good egg .
In this I go against the grain .
Um , the thing is , , they 're all the same .
If you 're bad , you do what you want , and so , you 're honest and so it 's easy to be free .
Plus when you yourself have already decided that you 're a bad kid , then , you achieve a kind of liberation , and you 're completely liberated and free .
I think that --
Um , of course today we say , at that time , um , in that class of ours , they were n't all necessarily bad kids .
Mm .
They just were n't like normal kids .
, it was like a brotherhood .
Ah , and we did some things that were out of bounds .
Mm , we helped each other .
Very sincere , very sincere and good .
When he was in that class , Ye Daying received patient teaching every day .
At that time he encountered the first love of his life that still remains fresh in his memory .
This girl became the only light in Ye Daying 's dark life for several years .
In those days if a middle school student liked a fellow - student , how did he go about expressing that ?
Um .
When I was a school kid , for example , Um , that girl , who ran the kitchen and was one of the better students in our class , I liked her .
Mm .
I always felt , um , she can , give you more on your plate , put more things on your plate for you to eat .
And then the most obvious way was um , to go see a movie together .
Mm .
It was ,
So already you could -- Go see a movie ; I thought ,
That was it , that was it .
You just want to go see the movie , you do n't worry about holding hands or not , um , and that was great , --
So you went to the movies with this girl ?
Yes .
Do you still remember what movies you saw ?
The Flower Girl .
I still remember that now .
Mm .
She cried as hard as she could .
So seeing The Flower Girl was the equivalent of seeing Titanic now .
Oh , yes , yes , a bit , a bit , yes , all was ready , no cry .
Yes , crying her eyes out , a big film like that .
At the time I thought I would n't cry .
But the people all around were crying , and I thought if I did n't cry it would look bad .
So then you cried .
So then I thought , I should let my emotions go .
Um , how was the girl , was she very pretty ?
, now I remember that she was very pretty , mm .
Mm .
She was a very good student .
Ha ha , this --
How was it she liked you ?
At that time we did n't talk about it , if two people gave each other the eye and felt it was right , then ,
Gave each other the eye , while you were in the class you gave each other the eye .
, so , when we were in class , for example you ,
I remember how it happened , yes .
Um . When we went to class , in the classroom , it was all very chaotic .
Mm .
Mm .
So then , we 'd each pick up a piece of chalk and toss the chalk back and forth . And throw spitballs .
I threw it at someone else but missed , and it hit her .
The result was that she turned her head to look .
And she looked at you angrily .
I thought , uh-oh , the expression in her eyes was like she would forgive you , that kind of feeling .
I thought wow , it 's so wonderful , that kind of feeling .
Mm .
That 's how it was , I should say .
It was like that ?
Mm .
Many years later , afterward , we graduated from senior middle school , and I was still going to see her .
Mm .
The --
, so we all took the exams for college , and things changed , right .
You graduated from middle school in '73 .
'74 .
Mm .
Graduated from midle school in '74 .
Mm , that female schoolmate went to the Shanghai suburbs to live and work .
Right , right , yes .
Ye Daying went to work in a factory ; at that time your monthly wages were , forty - some yuan ?
Mm , when I started it was a technical school .
Then at first it was 13 yuan , the first year 13 yuan ; the second year it was 15 yuan , and the third year it was 41 yuan .
Mm .
Mm .
41 yuan , at the time , for him , it was , an astronomical sum , um , a lot of money .
It was a lot of money .
In 1976 , there were two happy events in the Ye family .
The first was that his father , Ye Zhengming , was released and reunited with his family that he had been separated from for three years .
The second event was that Ye Daying had his 18th birthday and became an adult .
With the turn for the better in his father 's political circumstances , Ye Daying left behind his violent life and changed suddenly , becoming more inward - looking .
In 1978 the big news was that the college entrance exams would be reinstated nationwide , and people of Ye Daying 's age were thrilled .
However , at this time Ye Daying , facing this opportunity that would change his fortune , was at a loss as to what to do .
You thought those days were pretty good , did you not think about getting into the university ?
Oh my , in fact , '78 , for me , was an especially depressing time .
Mm .
Mm .
Up to then , um , I had never thought about the future .
Mm .
I thought everybody was the same , your fate settled things for you , um , you either go to a place live and work , or you became a -LRB- factory -RRB- worker .
In society , being a worker was already not so bad a thing , um , a way to move ahead .
Um , in '78 suddenly they reinstated the college entrance exams .
At that time , in '78 , I was 20 .
A lot of people were happy , very excited , because they reinstated the college entrance exams ; why were you feeling depressed ?
Right , but the problem was , , Because , I had never done well in school .
So right off I felt that I was finished , --
Those kids who were younger than us who had done well in school , , compared to me , they had a future , um , they could stand out .
Mm .
So I was hopeless , right off I was feeling down .
Very clearly a --
If you wanted to take the exams , what kind of score did you think you 'd get .
I did n't take the exams , I did n't have the nerve , I did n't try , so --
, the extraordinary thing was , at that time my mom was attending the film institute , she was an instructor there .
Mm .
Mm , I had n't thought , , that I would work in the movie .
Mm .
, um , she wanted to send the recruitment announcement to a friend 's house .
Mm .
So then I --
One day she sent me to deliver it , and so I picked it up and read it , and once I read it , oh ! The directing department of the film institute , inside , no language exams , no math or physics or chemistry exams , and I thought wow ! This is just the ticket .
Let 's run off to try and see .
I thought you 've loved movies ever since you were little , and then every day sitting in the movie theater you thought , I want to be a director .
No , I did n't , no .
It was just because there was no English exam , no exams in math or physics or chemistry .
Right , it was very simple .
Mm .
One more thing , because in '78 , the Beijing Film Institute was recruiting students in Shanghai --
Right .
So , Ye Daying went to take the exams for the film institute , but did n't pass the exams .
His mother , An Qi , had never thought that Ye Daying would sign up to take the exam for her work unit , the Beijing Film Institute .
But Ye Daying in fact failed when he took the reinstated exam .
Although it was the first time he had taken the exam , it left Ye Daying even more convinced that movies were something he could do .
The next year , 21 - year - old Ye Daying passed the entrance exam for the actors training class at the Xi'an Film Studio .
Being an actor was not his goal ; he hoped rather to get into the directing profession .
At that time you especially admired directors , right ?
Mm , because after I got to the Xi'an Film Studio , um , I discovered I had the shakes when I got on stage .
Mm .
Mm . Now , here chatting with you , I feel , um , it does n't matter .
Even today , in front of the lens , I 'm a nervous wreck .
Mm , very tense .
Did you act then ?
Of course , every day we had to , um , it was n't just recitation , so , doing sketches , this and that .
I thought , this is definitely not working .
Just getting on stage gave you the shakes .
Then , , no , it was n't my thing , this , I could n't find out why , and besides in those days ,
Um , it was in '80 that I went to the Xi'an Film Studio ,
Mm .
At that time , it was , always that kind of pompous stuff , or , that milquetoast kind of young male character , that kind of thing .
And I 'm not that kind of person , so I could n't get my bearings .
So then at the same time when I saw that Teng Wenji , he was probably thirty - some years old , he was the previous generation to us , very stubborn .
Mm .
Mm .
That projecting force of his , I thought wow , , that 's really good .
He could really project .
Because ultimately , there , I gradually realized this .
Mm .
And I would be in the audience and see him directing on site .
Mm .
Mm , I could see how they worked .
In fact in the beginning the attraction to movies was all these things , I thought it was really a bunch of fluff , I thought , that 's really fun , that 's really interesting .
I thought who was stubborn , then I wanted to be that kind of person , but that did n't mean I knew anything about that profession .
So no one ever came looking for you to do a play ?
At that time --
Mm , no one ever came looking -- .
They looked , but it was always just for an extra .
, you did n't even have any lines .
Mm .
That Xi'an Incident thing , I played an extra once .
There was a guy playing Zhang Xueliang , and I played his secretary going in to report to him , and I did it a few times but I was always in the wrong place .
What were your lines supposed to be ?
It was " reporting , a telegram " that sort of thing .
So you --
So I had never served as a soldier , that kind of pose , it was really awful .
So after I gave that up , no , it was not that kind of thing .
So the old director , Cheng Yin , um ,
Mm .
He would say , this is An Qi 's son , why is he like that ?
Do you remember how many takes you did ?
Oh , a lot .
I think it was something like ten plus times .
It was too , I 'd walk badly and turn like that .
, I attended that class for half a year , um , um and then I got sick .
Um , I got , , an inflammation of the central nervous system , so my whole body was paralyzed .
Your whole body was paralyzed ?
Right .
Your whole body was paralyzed ?
Right . I was paralyzed for ten months .
So you could n't move at all .
I could n't move at all .
When it started , my leg went numb , then my hand went numb , and then it started cross over , like that , and then slowly , slowly , slowly I could n't move .
What 's the scientific name of the disease ?
It 's called Guillain - Barre Syndrome .
It 's named after a foreigner .
Mm .
Ahem , if naming it somewhat common , it 's , a paralysis of the central nervous system , um , it goes from the nerve endings to the flesh , and , then it turns into myasthenia .
And how did you get better , later ?
Hormones .
You took hormones .
Um , , every day I had a transfusion .
Mm , after you get hormones , people may get very fat .
Mm .
Very fat .
I 'm so fat now , but compared to then it 's much better , in fact .
At that time how fat were you ?
Yah .
Getting so fat , it was this , if I looked down I could see my own cheeks , so I thought I was really fat .
What do you mean ?
If I just look down , my cheeks are right here .
But after they finished with the hormones , I gradually got better .
Mm .
The flesh all atrophied , um .
If you look at when I was in middle school , based on that bit of exercise --
Later , based on that , it all evaporated .
I 've heard it said that that Wang Shuo novel , which we later saw as a television play --
Sometimes , oh , right .
Mm .
Get some fun .
Get some fun .
The language in that , the part Wang Zhiwen played , the disease he got is about the same as your disease , is n't it ?
Right , right , right , right .
So sometimes , oh , it was me and Wang Shuo , together , it was , um , in '89 .
Mm , together , um , wrote a -- .
Aye , the script I wanted , the novel he wrote , um , that piece we created together .
Mm .
Therefore , at that time , we were talking and talking to shoot , an urban love story , tell a love story , so he took me , at that time , , more or less that story , as background .
Mm .
Then after I went back to Beijning , when we made arrangement and were eating together , I saw Wang Shuo for the first time
Then , when I saw him for the first time , Wang Shuo was holding a book in his arms , a book , that was Floating on the Sea , that novel he wrote , it was a sample .
Mm .
Gave it to me , and I took it back to school to read .
I read it and wow , that day , I thought he would be able --
Our generation could really find ourselves , I mean --
Um , in the end I knew we --
Why we studied movies , um , and why wrote things , expressing one 's own kind of thing is the most accurate person
Ye Daying had already read Wang Shuo 's novel Love the Hard Way , and the story and the style it was written in made a profound impression on him .
He sighed , this expresses what our generation really wants to express .
Later he was introduced by a friend , and Ye Daying met the author of the novel , Wang Shuo , at the film institute .
That was the beginning of their long friendship , which continues today .
How many plays did you collaborate on ?
A much better looking News Night I might add as Paula Zahn sits in for Anderson and Aaron /.
They 're both off /-
Look at that /.
Is that a replacement /?
Paula Paula /.
Thank you for your faith Larry and thank you for your graciousness /.
And we 're going to get started here /.
Good evening everybody /.
Welcome to News Night /.
As uh Larry just told you I 'm Paula Zahn filling in for the two men Anderson Cooper and Aaron Brown /.
He lost his life long ago /.
but there 's still something modern science can give him back his identity /.
The mystery of the frozen airman continues /.
Next stop the lab /.
And anger in the hood over a sign of the times /.
If Fifty Cent does n't have good sense then he needs to stop doing what he 's doing /.
The rap star 's new movie is one thing /.
but the billboards for it are another /.
Residents of Los Angeles want them and their message moved /.
and the studio is caving /.
Also tonight the rise and fall and rise and fall and rise and fall of Martha Stewart /.
How many ups and downs can one woman have /?
This is News Night /.
First of all here 's a quick track of some of the stories we 're following tonight /.
President Bush unveiled a seven point one billion dollar plan to help protect Americans against the threat from bird flu /.
It includes stockpiling enough vaccine to protect twenty million people /.
The president says there is no immediate threat but there is cause for concern /.
In Washington tensions are high after an unsual Senate session /.
Democrats used a little used rule to force a special closed session /.
Democrats say it was to force Republican leaders to complete a long promised investigation into how Bush administration officials handled pre-war intelligence on Iraq /.
Republicans for their part are calling it a political stunt /.
And Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld says more American troops could soon be heading to Iraq /.
He says they will be needed temporarily to prevent an expected increase in insurgent attacks ahead of Iraq 's parliamentary election in December /.
But we begin tonight with an ongoing mystery /.
Who is that lone man discovered last month frozen in California 's Sierra Nevada mountains with just a few tantalizing clues to his identity /?
This we do know at this hour /.
The man died more than sixty years ago /.
He was in the military apparently a World War Two airman /.
And while it looks like his plane crashed in the mountains so did twenty - five other planes around the same time /.
Thelma Gutierrez went inside the forensic laboratory where scientists are trying to solve this mystery /.
An address book a plastic comb a vintage penny /.
You 're looking at the last things a young airman put into his pockets on the day he died clues to a World War Two cold case that you 're about to see for the very first time /.
It is a mystery that begins high in the Sierra Nevada Mountains at the bottom of a glacier /.
Two weeks ago climbers discovered a frozen man face down in the snow still in his army air force uniform and an unopened silk parachute /.
After six decades the airman is exhumed from his icy tomb and thawed out /.
but he 's wearing no military dog tags or ID /.
Did this World War Two pilot perish when his training flight crashed in the mountains like twenty - five other ill fated flights more than sixty years ago /?
The search for clues takes us to Honolulu Hawaii to the joint powmia accounting command or jpac /.
The mystery of the frozen airman is just one of more than a thousand different unsolved cases that scientists here at jpac are trying to solve /.
In this laboratory alone I 'm surrounded by the remains of at least twenty different service members who are in the process of being identified so that they too can go home /.
The investigation begins with a team of forensic specialists who probe and study the airman 's bones teeth and his belongings to piece together who he is /.
And almost immediately clues begin to surface /.
Dr. Robert Mann a forensic anthropologist has determined that the airman was Caucasian and had fair hair /.
Next though I 'm going to have to look at his clavicles /.
The airman 's collar bones and pelvic bones prove that he was in his twenties and died in an airplane crash /.
This is a person who likely died on impact versus perhaps freezing to death up in the mountains /.
I think that uh the injuries were so substantial um and severe that he would n't have felt anything /.
He would have died immediately /.
One two /-
Another important clue /.
He has a significant number of uh fillings /.
Like the bones xrays of his wisdom teeth also tell us something about his age /.
Root tips are closed /.
they 're sealed up which is more indicative of someone who would be at least twenty - one years old /.
And Dr. Andy Henry notices something else /.
The airmen have straight teeth /.
so he had a nice smile good teeth /.
Yes I would have to say that yes /.
Then there are the material clues the things he had on him when he died that offer a snapshot into who he could have been /.
If there 's a badge or anything else that /-
We know he was wearing a World War Two army air force uniform /.
Remnants of his sweater undergarments and socks are still intact /.
And more clues emerge from his tattered uniform a corroded nameplate this pin on his collar and this army aircorps insignia /.
When I found these insignia I was happy to see them /.
And our young white - haired airman also carried this black comb and some pocket change forty - five cents worth /.
Some of these dimes are in ranging from nineteen thirty - six to nineteen forty - two /.
In his uniform breast pocket Dr. Paul Emanovsky found this vintage Schafer pen and three small leatherbound address books /.
The pages have been decomposing /.
but could they contain names of friends and loved ones /?
And we 're going to put it in a spectral comparator /.
At first nothing /.
then like magic clues begin to emerge /.
Uh you can see all these letters from the calendar Sunday Monday Tuesday up at the top one nine four and two /.
Nineteen forty - two /.
Yeah /.
After hours of meticulous examination of each address book they yield no personal information clues that could have faded with time /.
And so while we still do not know who our twenty - something fair - haired airman is enormous progress has been made /.
Out of the thousands of unidentified World War Two service members Dr. Mann says they 've narrowed it down to just ten /.
So what was it like to grow up there /?
In Pleasant Grove we recently met these three sisters all in their eighties who have high hopes that the frozen airman proves to be their big brother Glen Munn whose plane went missing in the Sierra back in nineteen forty - two /.
Oh I just wanted you know to know that he was found and that we can have him brought home here for burial and /-
We do n't know that though /.
We do n't /.
but that 's my wishes /.
And until they learn otherwise they say they will keep that hope alive /.
And in the weeks and months ahead scientists are convinced they will identify this airman and return him home to his family wherever they might be /.
Thelma Gutierrez CNN Honolulu Hawaii /.
And there are some new developments to talk about tonight /.
Scientists may be even closer to solving the mystery /.
For an update we 're joined by Dr. Robert Mann one of the senior scientists you just saw working on this cold case /.
Thanks for spending time with us tonight doctor /.
We understand since Thelma left your laboratories you 've now wittled this down to perhaps four airmen /.
is that true /?
Well hi Paula /.
yes we have /.
Uh when the remains came in a little over a week ago our analysts and historians got to work on that /.
and they were able to wittle it down the number of missing aircraft uh to a few /.
and at this point they 've wittled it down to one aircraft and a missing crew of four individuals /.
So we 've gone from several possible aircraft to one aircraft and from several missing airmen to four /.
So how much easier will that make it for you to unlock this case , do you think /?
Well I think it 'll help quite a bit /.
Um any time you 've got a body uh or remains like this that has come in and they 're in pretty good condition such as this one is , it 's mummified remains /.
We have some soft tissue we can deal with /.
so we can look at the color of the hair /.
we can tell right away the race and the sex of the individual /.
but then there are other things that are hidden beneath the soft tissue that are revealed only in the skeleton /.
and that 's where we 're going to now /.
So in the interest of full disclosure what I know about forensics is basically what I 've learned on CSI /.
and one would think that because you 've got it now narrowed down to four potential airmen that perhaps you could go to four families get strands of hair and try to do a potential DNA match with what you 've found in the ice /.
Is it not that simple /?
Well no no it 's not that simple /.
Um one thing we always caution people about is the pool of aircraft and missing airmen could be larger than what we 're looking at /.
And what we want to do is we do n't want to just look at the material evidence that we have and immediately um jump to a conclusion that this is a certain individual /.
What we want to do is have the evidence speak for itself /.
and when we look at this individual as we 've done the biological profile looking at his remains his bones his teeth and the material evidence /.
and what we 're able to tell from this individual is that he died in his twenties he stood somewhere between five foot nine and six foot two inches tall um he sustained massive trauma to his body on impact /.
And he 's Caucasoid male /.
and so we know much more now just one week later than what we did when he came in about eight days ago /.
So the most important question is when do you think you 're going to know exactly who he is /?
Well that 's the most commonly asked question that we have /.
and you know the reality is nobody can give you the answer /.
Nobody knows for sure exactly when we 'll identify him /.
What it depends on is that all the lines of evidence come together for successful identification /.
If I were to give my best opinion in this it would be a few weeks to a few months /.
Well we 'll be keeping our fingers crossed for you /.
Know how hard you all are working in the lab there Dr. Mann /.
Thank you for spending some time with us tonight /.
Our pleasure /.
Thank you Paula /.
thank you /.
We 're going to turn now to some of the other stories in our world tonight /.
Here 's Erica Hill from Headline News /.
Hi Erica /.
Hi Paula /.
we start off with a tragic dispute after a traffic /.
a tragic death has now been settled in court /.
Now the dispute came between divorced parents over where to bury their son who was killed in Iraq /.
A California judge has now ruled army staff sergeant Jason Hendrix to remain buried next to his grandfather that is in Oklahoma where his father lives /.
His mother claimed her son wanted to be buried in California where she lived /.
but the judge says her testimony was quote forced and contrived /.
Austin Texas Republican Congressman Tom DeLay gets his way /.
The judge scheduled to preside over his trial was removed from the case today /.
DeLay 's attorneys heads off the recusal because they questioned the judge 's impartiality since he had contributed to Democratic causes /.
DeLay is charged with money laundering and conspiracy /.
He has pleaded not guilty /.
In Washington the federal reserve once again raising a key short term interest rate by a quarter percent /.
It is the twelfth such hike since June of last year /.
More could be on the way /.
In its statement the fed dismissed concerns that the economy has slowed down because of Hurricane Katrina /.
And in case you missed it the Royals are here /.
Today Britain 's Prince Charles and his wife Camilla laid flowers at the World Trade Center site in New York and then dedicated a nearby memorial to British victims of the nine eleven attack /.
It is the first stop on their eight day trip across the United States Paula /.
and I 'm sure I 'll be hearing a little bit more about it all week /.
Yeah Erica I actually um bumped into them along with three hundred of their closest friends earlier tonight on their last stop of the day here in New York /.
and they were uh uh uh amazingly casual and accessible /.
We were all quite surprised /.
That 's good to hear /.
Thanks Erica /.
see you a little bit later on /.
And still to come on News Night tonight the saddest post-Katrina stories were those of the eldery who died in hospitals and nursing homes /.
Now there are thirteen investigations into why and how such tragedies happened /.
And supermodels are n't the only ones to whom weight matters /.
Jockies also may go too far to stay thin much too far /.
When at my worst I was heaving three or five to six seven times a day /.
Starving to stay thin that and more still to come on News Night /.
They happen to be the most vulnerable of hurricane victims the elderly many desperately ill living in nursing homes their fate in the hands of others /.
Dozens died /.
There are at least thirteen investigations now underway /.
And at some nursing homes the failure to evacuate cost lives /.
In other cases it was the evacuation itself that proved fatal /.
Here 's Keith Oppenheim /.
My mother was Thelma Wahl /.
She was ninety years old /.
She was a very good mother /.
She was at Huntingdon because she needed care /.
Priscilla Scott is mourning /.
Her ninety year old mother Thelma Wahl was a resident of the Huntingdon Place Nursing Home in Chalmette outside New Orleans /.
Priscilla says Thelma Wahl had serious osteoperosis fractures in her vertebrae but says Thelma was not on the verge of death /.
On Sunday August twenty - eighth the day before Hurricane Katrina struck the nursing home decided to evacuate patients /.
They waited too late to make the decision /.
Priscilla says her mother should have been transported by ambulance /.
Instead she says her mother sat on a school bus for twelve hours to Lafayette Louisiana normally a three hour trip /.
She says police told her there was no air conditioning /.
Police declined comment /.
The owner of the nursing home Thelma Wahl was being taken to tells us by the time the bus arrived Thelma Wahl was dead /.
I feel that uh the bus is what did it to her /.
She was alive when she left that nursing home /.
but she was not alive when she got to the Lafayette area /.
CNN made repeated attempts to contact administrators or representatives of Huntingdon Place /.
but either we could not make contact or our calls were not returned /.
But staff for the Louisiana Attorney General 's office did speak to us by phone and confirmed that the matter of just what happened to Thelma Wahl when she was transported from this facility is under investigation /.
After dozens of patients died in the wake of Hurricane Katrina nursing homes have been under scrutiny /.
Thirty - four patients were left behind at Saint Rita 's nursing home in New Orleans when Katrina hit /.
They all died in the flood /.
The owners were charged with negligent homicide /.
The county coroner says he urged Saint Rita 's to move its patients /.
They insisted several patients were too fragile to move /.
Before Hurricane Rita a busload of nursing home residents were being evacuated from Houston /.
but during the ride a fire from a back wheel accelerated because of oxygen canisters patients on board were using /.
Twenty - three people died /.
Federal officials are investigating /.
No charges have been filed /.
Joe Dodges executive director of the Louisiana Nursing Home Association says when it comes to evacuations elder care facilities are damned if they do and damned if they do n't /.
Walk a mile in our shoes that 's all I have to say because anybody who works in a nursing home will very quickly learn that these are very fragile patients /.
We did the very best we could in these situations /.
We 've got /-
Dodges says the reality is old sick patients are always in jeopardy when a hurricane strikes a dilemma made worse by massive traffic jams during pre-storm evacuations /.
I mean if they 're on a bus for nine or twelve hours there 's a good chance someone 's going to die unfortunately /.
Certainly it 's a very very difficult question to answer should I evacuate /?
Jeff Meitrod and Steve Riddyah write for the Times Picayune New Orleans ' daily newspaper /.
They say nursing homes had to make tough calls /.
But last spring in a series of stories called State of Neglect they reported that Louisiana 's nursing homes are often poorly run and poorly regulated /.
Nursing homes that kill residents nursing homes that um seriously injure patients um because of bad care /.
uh and the state does n't really do very much about it /.
and so nursing home owners know that in a lot of cases it 's less expensive to break the rules and to hurt people than it is to provide the level of care that /-
Huntington Place was criticized in the articles and has had several law suits brought against it /.
but it had a good inspection record /.
Priscilla Scott says she is trying to contact the nursing home owners but has n't been able to find them /.
She feels even if they had to make a tough call they owe her a better explanation as to why her mother died /.
Keith Oppenheim CNN New Orleans /.
It still is n't clear why Huntington evacuated Thelma Wahl by bus rather than by ambulance /.
but officials have said there were not enough ambulances to take care of everyone in the region /.
Tomorrow night I will have a special report on a struggle that affects more than ten million Americans including one million men the struggle with eating disorders anorexia and bulimia /.
As I just said it 's not just women and girls who are affected /.
Men too struggle with these disorders /.
and I interviewed one of the nation 's top jockies Shane Sellers about the battle he waged everyday to control his weight /.
In the morning I 'd get up and take a diet pill um drink a cup of coffee um and then head out to the race track and /-
With no food in your stomach /.
No food in my stomach no /.
And um you know you go and see the trainers and work your horses in the morning that you have to work /.
Um by ten o'clock you 're finished uh /-
Were you hungry at this point /?
Oh I 'm starving you know /.
I mean I went to bed with nothing in my stomach either /.
Maybe you know just a piece of ham or s- /-
You know just grab something to put in my stomach before I went to bed and head to the track and maybe lay down for an hour and then uh head to the hotbox for a couple hours four or five pounds of water /.
The hotbox is a sauna a fixture in almost every jockey locker room /.
The hotbox sweatbox /.
Sellers would often spend two hours inside pooling or sweating off extra pounds /.
And are you miserable the whole time you 're in there /?
Oh it 's horrible /.
You have to be very weak /.
Weak /.
Ca n't have nothing /.
Yeah you 're already dehydrated you know /?
So for more than twenty years you went through this process of basically not eating anything during the day sitting in the sauna a couple hours a day sweating two or three pounds off getting back on your horses training and maybe maybe having a piece of ham /.
and that 's all you had to sustain you /.
If I did eat anything sometime , when at my worst three or five to six seven times a day I was heaving /.
Jockies call it heaving or flipping /.
doctors would call it bulimia /.
Overcome by hunger pains Sellers would eat massive amounts of food and then throw it up to make weight /.
He says a tour of a jockey locker room shows you just how easy and accepted it was /.
These are regular toilets /.
and this is what they call a heaving /.
this is where they heave /.
You know it 's a much different type of commode /.
I do n't know if it was especially made for that purpose /.
but it 's sure not the same as the other /.
and that 's what we used it for /.
Is it true that some of you got so efficient at flipping that you could actually do it without putting your finger down your throat /.
I was one /.
Jockey Shane Sellers just one of the many people you 'll meet tomorrow night in Walking the Thin Line /.
It is a special edition of Paula Zahn Now that gets underway at eight pm eastern /.
Still to come on News Night tonight the Senate shuts down the doors clears the gallery /.
Was today 's rare closed session needed to gaurd national secrets /.
or was it a political forum /.
And the president wants billions to help fight a possible bird flu pandemic /.
Sounds like a lot of money /.
but will it actually be enough /?
Also tonight rap star Fifty Cent may be at the top of the charts /.
but one LA neighborhood is n't buying it /.
We ca n't say how those who will be voting on Samuel Alito 's nomination to Supreme Court feel about him /.
but we can say something about how you feel tonight /.
Here are the results of the CNN USA Today Gallup poll released just minutes ago of those asked about the president 's choice Judge Alito to succeed Justice Sandra Day O'Connor /.
Seventeen percent said he 's an excellent choice /.
twenty - six percent called him a good choice /.
twenty - two percent rated him only fair /.
seventeen percent thought he was a poor choice /.
Questions about the facts or what were presented as facts that led the United States into the war in Iraq spilled into open warfare today on the Senate floor /.
Democrats forced the Senate into a rare closed door session /.
Republican leader Bill Frist said the Senate was hijacked /.
CNN 's Ed Henry was there /.
A Democratic sneak attack that sent shock waves through the Senate /.
Mr. President enough time has gone by /.
I demand on behalf of the American people that we understand why these investigations are n't being conducted /.
Democratic leader Harry Reed accused Republicans of failing to probe allegations the White House manipulated intelligence to justify the war in Iraq /.
And in accordance with rule twenty - one I now move that Senate go into closed session /.
President I second the motion /.
An easy but rare maneuver with extraordinary consequences /.
The Senate chamber was locked down , television cameras shut off , so law makers could go into secret session to debate /.
Republican leader Bill Frist was enraged /.
Not with the previous Democratic leader or the current Democratic leader have ever I been slapped in the face with such an affront to the leadership of this grand institution /.
There has been at least consideration for the other side of the aisle before a stunt /.
and this is a pure stunt /.
Reed refused to back down demanding the Republican led intelligence committee finish a long awaited report on whether the Bush administration twisted intelligence /.
This investigation has been stymied stopped , obstructions thrown up every step of the way /.
That 's the real slap in the face /.
that 's the slap in the face /.
And today the American people are going to see a little bit of light /.
What 's really going on is Democrats feel emboldened by the indictment of Vice President Cheney 's former chief of staff believing this is their chance to issue a broader indictment of the Bush administration /.
We have lost over two thousand of our best and bravest /.
over fifteen thousand have been seriously wounded /.
We are spending more than six million dollars a month with no end in sight /.
and this Republican led Senate intelligence committee refuses to even ask the hard questions about the misinformation /-
Republicans insist they 're completing the investigation /.
and this is just a distraction /.
This is purely political /.
This is settling an old political score /.
Democrats say they also want to signal they 're ready to stand up to the Republican majority and may even filibuster the president 's latest Supreme Court pick Samuel Alito a move that would make these events seem like the opening fireworks in a much nastier battle /.
Ed Henry CNN Capitol Hill /.
So do you think we just saw the outlines to what the midterm election battlelines might look like /?
A debate that 's likely to rage on for many many months to come /.
Turning our attention now to something that has a lot of folks concerned /.
You 've been hearing an awful lot about avian or bird flu /.
The most common and deadly form has already spread in birds from South Asia to Europe /.
And now there is real concern that the virus could mutate and become devastating to humans /.
In fact some health experts say it 's just a matter of time /.
Today President Bush unveiled a seven point one billion dollar plan to prepare for a possible flu pandemic /.
Now much of that money would go toward stockpiling enough vaccine to protect twenty million healthcare workers and other first responders speeding up production of vaccines and buying the anti-viral drugs Tamoflu and Rolenzo which in some cases prevent flu infection /.
And we now turn to senior medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupto who has just gotten back from South Asia where bird flu has in the past two years killed at least sixty - two people about half of those who were struck with it /.
Hundreds of millions of birds around the world have been destroyed to try to contain the disease /.
And Dr. Gupto now just joins us from the Emory University hospital in Atlanta /.
Always good to see you doctor /.
So /-
Thanks /.
I know you 've had a chance to study the plan the president put forth today /.
Does it go far enough in your estimation /?
You know what 's sort of interesting Paula /.
on one hand it is remarkable that the president is devoting as much time and as much money uh all towards a disease that does n't exist yet /.
Pandemic flu does n't exist yet /.
But a lot of people are talking about it /.
and I think that 's remarkable to a lot of people eh who are citizens and a lot of people in the public health community as well /.
On the other hand to be able to outline and do the thing that were talked about today to basically completely revamp the public health system so that local officials can talk to state officials that can talk to federal officials to be able to pinpoint exactly when a cluster of bird flu happens that takes probably a lot more money and really a complete revamping of our public health systems /.
The other thing Paula really important is that they talk a lot about the fact that we 're a lot better at taking care of patients now than we were in nineteen eighteen , we have a lot of ICUs a lot of ICUs in the hospital behind me that can take care of critically ill patients /.
The problem though at any given time eighty to ninety percent of those ICU rooms are full so we just do n't have the surge capacity and that 's going to cost lots and lots of money to create a health system where we can take care not only of the ill now but the ill that might come in with a pandemic Paula /.
Uh let 's talk about the other problem of the plan where the president wants to spend a billion dollars to stockpile antiviral medicine like Tamaflu and Rolenza /.
Do we even know if these two medications are going to be effective against a strain that has n't even presented itself /?
here 's the important thing about that /.
We do n't know for sure /.
A lot of people focusing a lot of energy on Tamaflu and Rolenza /.
These are antiviral drugs /.
they are not vaccines /.
They are antiviral drugs uh designed to basically shorten uh how bad the flu might effect you uh try to lessen its impact /.
But we only know that it might work because of laboratory studies and animal studies uh uh in particular /.
The way to really study it would be to knowingly expose people to bird flu /.
and nobody will actually ever do that study for obvious reasons /.
So it 's just theoretical really for the most part that those will work Paula /.
Dr. Sanjay Gupto thanks for the update /.
By the way are you catching a cold /?
A a little bit /.
You know I just got back /.
and the ninteen hour plane ride /.
Not bird flu though /.
I can assure you that Paula /.
Chicken soup /.
That 's right /.
Just what the doctor ordered /.
Works all the time /.
Yeah right /.
I made a free house call for you doctor /.
Coming up on News Night Tonight , cooking a turkey is fine /.
appearing in one is n't /.
Will her Nielson do to Martha Stewart what her prison time did n't /?
Rapper Fifty Cents or Fitty Cent as some of you say sells millions of records /.
but one neighborhood does n't like the sales pitch /.
They call him Fitty Cent /.
but he is worth millions /.
His music like the gold single PIMP may come straight from violent inner city streets /.
but suburban kids from coast to coast love the heavy base beat /.
The music sells /.
but not everyone is buying the message /.
Savela Vargas reports /.
Fitty Cent 's film Get Rich or Die Trying has n't even hit theaters yet /.
but its marketing has already enraged people in South Central Los Angeles /.
Since two thousand there have been eight hundred homicides in this community /.
Now who wants to uphold that standard /?
Who wants to keep perpetrating that madness /?
The movie 's billboard shows the rapper in a crucifixion - like pose brandishing a microphone in one hand and a gun in the other /.
Paramount you are doing damage to our community /.
you are doing an injustice to our community /.
and you committing violence in our community /.
and that includes Fifty Cent too /.
It must go /.
And go it did /.
A day after about twenty five people rallied in Hyde Park Paramount pulled one sign down and since has pulled about half a dozen others near LA area schools /.
I think what happens oftentimes people are so overwhelmed in communities particularly African American communities by say an image in this case Hollywood /.
It just seems so big /.
it just seems so overwhelming /.
it 's almost like can we really fight City Hall /?
Whatever we 're going to do no matter how much outrage and anger that we express it 's not going to change anything /.
But in this case that was shown that that 's not the case /.
A Paramount spokesman says the company is reviewing billboards in other locations /.
Now similar complaints are coming from Brooklyn New York /.
Back in LA the image hits too close to home /.
Not too long ago we was over here /.
and a guy just pulled out a gun and was shooting right in front of my daughter /.
We did n't come back for a week cause I was scared and she was /.
So I mean that right there it enraged me /.
Not a good message /.
No it 's already enough gang violence out here /.
We do n't need that /.
Cynthia Levas director of Golden Day preschool thinks the billboard touched a nerve because many children here are Fitty Cent fans /.
When it comes to ABC they be like A B /.
and you have to wait for the other letters /.
but Fitty Cent song they can sing that word for word /.
Rapper Fitty Cent whose real name is Curtis Jackson says it was ludicrous to single out his poster /.
You got to look at how often we put out action films and other films that utilize weapons as a marketing tool /.
We 'll find guns or weapons on the cover of films probably more often than we 'll find people 's faces /.
He thinks the controversy will lead the film to greater box office success /.
but to the members of this community the victory is knowing that somebody listened /.
Man they heard us /.
They heard our voice /.
and I 'm glad /.
I mean I mean usually in this area nobody really cares /.
so for them to care about how we feel and how you know we raising our kids that meant a lot to all of us /.
so I 'm happy /.

Danger on the ground in Iraq and under it /.
IED Improvised Explosive Devices take a terrible toll /.
And prison barely dented her popularity /.
but can Martha Stewart survive her primetime ratings /?
Everyday in Iraq US soldiers work very hard to reassure local civilians train the Iraqi army and stay alive /.
but with the increasing power of Improvised Explosive Devices IEDs staying alive takes a lot of training and time /.
Eddie Shrahmin is imbedded with American soldiers in northern Bavil province /.
As the uh informants /-
Come here Strovell /.
listen up please /.
Like the soldiers he commands Lieutenant Colonel Ross Brown suits up daily trying to rid his area of roadside bombs /.
Whenever you roll out of the gate and you 're out there operating you never know if you 're going to hit one of these or not /.
The first stop today is Route Tampa some of the worst stretch of highway in what is called the Triangle of Death /.
Salaam Alakum /.
where these stall owners Brown told are aware of impending attacks /.
Did you know in advance that the IED was going to go off here /?
/.
Tell him to look me in the eye /.
/.
tell me that again /.
/.
It is a fine line to walk routing out information without creating new enemies battling an insurgency that kills at will , that turns civilians into accomplices /.
I think they 're scared to death /.
I think they see us as temporary and they got to live with those people forever /.
Finding friends locally seems the toughest part of Brown 's strategy /.
but his next task proves just as difficult /.
Here the Lieutenant Colonel has stopped at one of the firm bases one of the areas that Iraqis are manning their own position /.
The commander on duty emerges out of uniform /.
and the Lieutenant colonel struggles to find progress /.
they did n't do too much work yesterday /.
They did n't do too much work the day before /.
They have n't done too much work since they 've been here /.
/.
Brown is unsure if this unit can survive an insurgent attack uncertainties shared by the US forces as well each soldier with his own way to cope /.
Hey Morales you carry anything special with you on missions to help you out /?
Well I carry my wedding ring a bracelet my wife sent me /-
I carry a Bible Psalms ninety - one /.
A picture of an angel an archangel /.
I carry this little packet my kid gave me /.
See what my daughter /-
Daddy I love you /.
I miss you /.
be safe /.
come home ASAP /?
Is n't that cool /?
All right let 's go /.
Overhead helicopters are responding to an IED attack that moments ago killed Colonel William Wood the highest ranking US officer to die in combat in Iraq a personal friend of Brown 's an added personal reason why tomorrow he 'll be suiting up again /.
Eddie Shrahmin CNN northern Bavil Province /.
And we turn our attention now to London where a memorial service was held today for the fifty - two victims of the bomb attacks in the city 's public transport systems back in July /.
Queen Elizabeth and Prime Minister Tony Blair attended as did relatives to those who died and emergency workers who responded to the terrorist attacks /.
Andrew Carey has the story of three firefighters who were first on the scene at one of the bombings /.
A major incident in central London /-
Four explosions ripping through the subway s- /-
Chaos on services with some passengers trapped underground /.
It began as any other day you know just uh doing eh normal checks /.
At nine o'clock we started our shift /.
And so the bells went /.
It was about a minute past nine when we got the shout for uh smoke issuing in Allgate tube station /.
The explosion at Allgate was the first of the four bombs to go off on July the seventh at eight fifty in the morning /.
But Paul Kelly Steve Sodbury and Mel Anderson of Shadwell Firestation 's blue watch had no idea what had happened as they got into the fire engine to answer the call /.
On the arrival at Allgate we saw dozens of casualties outside the front sitting down /.
and it looked so serious that for one second I thought this must be like a training exercise /.
These people had flesh injuries /.
but they also had psychological injuries /.
They just needed reassurance /.
They just needed reassurance because a lot of them were scared /.
It always happens to someone else on the television a terrorist incident /.
As medical teams arrived at the scene Steve Paul and two other firefighters went into the station /.
This scene of walking down the platform and down the tracks with lines of injured people walking past you out the other way is /-
I 'll remember it forever I think /.
By the time they reached the second carriage they knew they were dealing with a bomb explosion /.
Carnage /.
A man sitting down next door he had half his leg /.
um a person lying down /.
there was like a half a torso in front of the carriage as you go in /.
It sounds very harsh to say now /.
but when you 're down there and you 're dealing with it it kind of just happens /.
You go into autopilot /.
and you look /.
and you think I ca n't help that person /.
let 's move on to the next one /.
Eight people including the bomber died at Allgate /.
one hundred and twenty were injured /.
At the end of the day back home with their loved ones a time for the firefighters to reflect and some mixed emotions /.
To them it was their happiness to see me walking through the door /.
but I knew that somewhere someone 's daughter was n't coming home , their father was n't coming home /.
Watching it on the news is completely different to looking in the eyes of a wounded person /.
As a fire brigade you 're there to rescue them /.
so it 'll always be a sense of regret as we did as much as we could but there was still a human cost and there 's nothing that we 'll ever be able to do about it /.

Still to come the ups and downs of Martha Stewart and the British are coming ! The British are coming !
No wait /.
are n't they already here /?
But does anyone really care /?
And now we 're going to take a look at the trials and tribulations of Martha Stewart /.
You might have thought serving time in prison was tough /.
As it turns out , being on the outside might be even tougher /.
It seems like just yesterday Martha Stewart was sprung from prison and poised for her comeback /.
This is a country where we believe in second acts , we believe in redemption , we believe in confessional stories , we believe in the comeback , we 've /-
Five months behind bars had n't dimmed Martha 's image /.
If anything it was soaring /.
Along with her company stock it doubled during that time /.
Martha once again took the helm of her company and her magazine /.
She also landed a starring role in the spinoff of one of TV 's hottest reality shows The Apprentice /.
Martha the woman everyone loves to hate was loved /.
It 's really wonderful to be back /.
I 've missed you as you can imagine /.
But what a difference a TV show makes especialy when that show is a flop /.
I 'm looking for the apprentice /.
The Apprentice Martha Stewart debuted in September /.
Her ratings tanked /.
and her stock followed suit plunging about forty - seven percent since her release from prison in March /.
Once again Martha Stewart is persona non grata /.
Even her friend and fellow Apprentice star Donald Trump made it clear that her show was not a good thing /.
He had this to say in a recent radio interview /.
I think there was confusion between Martha 's Apprentice and mine /.
and mine continues to do well /.
and the other has struggled very severely /.
I think it probably hurt mine /.
and I sort of predicted that it would /.
You 're fired /.
Ouch smackdown from the Donald /.
Donald /?
Martha Stewart punched back in a recent Fortune magazine interview saying she was actually told that she would be firing the Donald /.
Is the old Martha back again /?
She has a track record of being associated unfortunately with the B word and not a little B but a capital B /.
Can the comeback queen come back again /?
I think she can be saved /.
Anybody can be saved /.
Any organization can be saved /.
but it takes a lot of hard work /.
Is n't that one of the reasons for our infatuation with Martha /?
She 's the perennial story of celebrity redemption /.
She said this to Fortune magazine I have learned that I really can not be destroyed /.
Apparently Martha Stewart is betting on her own comeback as well /.
We 'll see /.
Still to come on News Night the prince and his brand new wife making their first trip to the US since their marriage /.
This time it 's not exactly a fairy tale /.
This week Americans are getting a rare chance to treat royalty well like royalty /.
Prince Charles and his new wife Camilla have jumped across the pond and are touring the United States making their first stop today in New York /.
It 's Charles ' first opportunity to showcase his new wife /.
but few Americans seem to care /.
Here 's Jeanie Mowth /.
What a difference two decades make /.
Charles and Diana visited a JC Penney 's on the prince 's last official US tour /.
Twenty years later here 's the prince with his new wife attending a party at the Museum of Modern Art along with Yoko Ono Diane Sawyer Henry Kissinger Donald Trump Joan Collins and even Sting /.
But it still stings some Diana fans to see those old shots of glamorous Princess Di dancing with John Travolta at the White House /.
But when it comes to Camilla gossip columnists can get pretty catty /.
We 're all welcoming the prince and the duchess or mistress of whatever she is this week /.
A lone protestor parked herself outside the UN where Charles would later visit /.
Camilla you are no princess said her sign with a horse on it /.
The horse is basically Camilla /.
We all know that she 's a horse /.
She does n't belong here /.
and she 'll never be able to take Diana 's place ever /.
But at least the horse is pretty /.
The royals flew in amid headlines declaring their visit a royal bore /.
Only ninteen per cent of Americans polled said they were interested in the visit /.

I see that in 2002 the increase in the number of people signing up for the public service exam reached eighty - nine percent .
By 2003 , eh , the percentage of the increase hit ninety - five percent .
In 2004 , eh , it reached 197 percent .
Then , in 2005 , it hit 50.3 percent .
Well , how is the situation this year .
This year applications are still really hot .
Hot to what degree .
Let 's put it this way , ah , this year central government institutions , eh , and their subordinate organizations have provided more than twelve thousand posts , while the number of people applying broke through the one million mark .
Uh-huh .
Uh , over twelve thousand posts , with the number of applicants exceeding one million .
That 's one percent .
Right .
That is , it was one percent of the number of people .
Yes , yes .
But we still have to explain a bit what 's going on inside , eh , these figures .
Uh-huh .
Actually , the number of people who actually take the confirmation exam is now more than 530,000 .
And , eh , the recruitment ratio is also one in more than forty .
Uh , approximately one in about forty .
That is to say , that there are about forty people competing for eh , one position .
Uh-huh .
Judging from the level of competition , these few years , eh , have also shown a steadily increasing trend .
I 've heard , um , for certain particularly hot positions , it can be said to reach a thousand to one .
I heard your friends say this , eh , saying that there is half of Ding Naizhu in Lai Shengchuan , and half of Lai Shengchuan in Ding Naizhu .
What does this mean .
Yes , I ah , can agree .
Can you .
Yes .
The reason is because we two actually have very , very , different personalities .
Eh .
Because in actual fact we well complement each other .
Oh .
Er , ordinary people would think , um , that he is probably , eh , that is , more heedless , or , I do n't know , uh , maybe I appear more careful .
Yes .
Actually , we two are the exact opposite , he is very careful , very careful .
Oh .
Yes .
And I am careless , when I put something away , it will be lost or it will be missing .
Like me , this , many , this --
However , we two , that is , complement each other very , very well .
Like in the troupe , ah , er , I actually decide the general direction of the whole troupe .
Yes .
for instance , I will decide on the way the troupe will proceed .
I am the one who focuses on this big direction .
Oh .
Usually , it does not matter to him .
He is on the production side , like this , oh .
Eh , but whenever it pertains to the details , eh , he is detailed , and he is very clear .
Yes .
I heard that Mr. Lai will even slice cabbage very finely and delicately .
Yes .
Very much so ,
everything he does , he wants the ambience to be just so , he is particular about the atmosphere , very particular .
He cooks , we both like to cook .
Yes .
When I cook , I cook , I can cook under any circumstance .
Yes .
When he cooks , he needs to put on the music , ah , the light , the music .
Like this --
Oh yes , so when he cooks , it 's very troublesome .
Yes .
We mentioned in the news earlier , ah , on that there were over a hundred flights , and tens of thousands of people might be affected .
So do we know right now if there is any new progress in the investigation .
Er , or I should say that the investigation is , eh , I should say , being aggressively carried out right now , ah .
Right now a total of 221 flights are affected , involving about , eh , 33,000 passengers .
Currently , these passengers , eh , have now , this , mainly flown by these three flights at , this , the end of this month ,
They were quite dispersed , some to Madrid , some to , eh , Barcelona , some to Athens , some to Stockholm , and there were also some to Turkey , what to Austria .
Therefore , right now , eh , the British authorities , eh , that is to say , are appealing to these passengers , eh , er , to report their , eh , situations to , eh , the British health department as soon as possible .
At the same time , eh , er , they have especially set up a hotline , um , hoping that everyone would call in .
Well , till now , eh , the latest count is about 450 people , eh , er , eh , who then have , eh , reported their health condition , eh , to the related British department .
Of these , the British , eh , er , Health Department , eh , has followed up on 18 people .
Er , among them , there were three major ones , eh , er , and they were transferred to this special hospital , eh , for treatment .
Of course , what all investors are most concerned about is , how long will this wave , this trend of appreciation last .
Also , eh , to enter at a time like this , for example , in Hong Kong , he can directly invest in the Renminbi , would it be profitable to enter the market right now .
Uh .
I believe that the appreciation of the RMB , eh , it will , er , be on a rising trend for a quite long time to come , because this is related to the , this , conditions of savings in China itself .
And behind the change in savings is a factor of demographics .
Right now in China 's , this , eh , a relatively large proportion of the population are young adults , and these people have higher savings , as they have to save for their children 's education , and for their own retirement .
Yes .
Therefore , during , eh , the middle of this stage , er , the high savings has resulted in a larger surplus in China 's regular accounts .
So this trend will last for a period of time .
But the issue is that the appreciation right now should be viewed as a gradual appreciation on a small scale .
So right now if you ask whether or not it will be profitable , eh , to exchange , this , other currencies into Renminbi , we will need to look at , this , this , the deficit .
So , as long as it is an independent brand name , ah , in addition to the expansion of your own company , you would naturally assume a type of responsibility .
Therefore in this process , eh , it is not only an operation with your own brand , and not only a domestic market - oriented approach with your own say , you can even create more opportunities for such cooperation in the global market , and the kind of operation that is geared toward our interests .
Therefore in this case , from the interest of the country , and from the , er , benefits on the part of both clients and partners , all these areas manifest the existence value of the enterprise Chery .
I know , people working in Chery have a saying : We will fight 20 years to have our own brand name .
eh , from the time Chery was founded to now , half of that time has already gone by .
In the remaining half , which is the next ten years , will we see a more brilliant Chery for sure .
Yes .
This Comrade Zhang Hailai has continued to teach us , saying that the people in the car industry should not be crazy , otherwise they will be killed .
So , we have already been crazy for the past ten years .
I think the next ten years is a decade that Chery needs to be even crazier .
Of course together let us wish that Chery , and wish that China would stand out from the crowd among the future competition within the car industry and break through all kinds of difficulties , and really bring honor to the people of China .
A mentally ill person can do some terrible things , right .
He may kill other people , and not have to bear any legal responsibilities .
So what should be done .
Hence the entire police , the entire social system should begin to monitor the mental state of the people .
Oh , this point of yours reminds me of that situation of Foucault .
Yes , that 's right , which is to start monitoring mental conditions .
How to go about monitoring .
For instance mental health is greatly emphasized in schools .
Er , there are many hospitals and social workers in the community , right .
Social workers they have to extensively visit different family communities , to see whether the members of this family , ah , are arguing all the time , or whether there is a great deal of marital discord between wife and husband .
They , eh , greatly advocated the popularization of psychiatrists .
So do you remember , when you , Mr. Xu , first went to the United States , you felt that the Americans were so abnormal for seeing psychiatrists even for minor issues .
Uh-huh .
In this kind of society like theirs , it 's not all that unusual to see a psychiatrist .
They have normalized that .
This is how , eh , the entire community keeps monitoring everyone 's mental state .
Hi everyone /.
first up on the docket tonight we got an interview with the witness who led investigators to a landfill in the search for Natalee Holloway /.
He 's telling NBC news what and who he saw just days after Natalee 's May thirtieth disappearance /.
Also Natalee 's mother met with the lead prosecutor in the investigation today /.
And while the landfill continues to be searched and lead suspect Joran Van Der Sloot is interrogated for the fourth straight day by a team of behavioral specialists NBC 's Michelle Kosinski remains in Aruba /.
So Michelle the authorities really believe that uh this witness with regard to the landfill 's credible , do n't they /?
Well the authorities including the FBI we found out had checked this witness out early on just days after Natalee disappeared /.
And we just found out about this witness a couple weeks ago /.
That 's when his existence became widely known through private investigators and other sources /.
And it has been reported that he was afraid to come forward /.
Well it turns out he was just afraid for his identity to be known /.
but we learned that he came forward very quickly after he says he saw what happened in the landfill that day just days after it happened /.
He talked to police /.
He talked to the FBI /.
The FBI actually went out to that landfill with dogs looked around that area even before it became piled up with garbage /.
and they did n't find anything /.
It 's the EquuSearch volunteers who really said hey we believe this guy /.
His story does n't change /.
He seems to pan out /.
He seems to be a lucid guy /.
He seems to also be insistent that he saw something /.
So he says he saw some men drive up in a white pickup truck men that he says he later recognized to be the three suspects in this case /.
He says they took what looked like a body out of the back of the pickup truck /.
It was wrapped up in a bag /.
But when the wind blew he says he saw the upper part of a woman 's body blonde hair /.
and then he says they buried this body there in the landfill /.
Well over a period of weeks some ten feet of garbage has piled up /.
EquuSearch will tell you too that when they bring out dogs it 's very difficult for a dog to catch a scent in that landfill when they 're coming across things like medical waste /.
but they 're determined to keep going /.
He saw uh the woman 's body and inside a bag /.
Her hair was blowing out with the wind /.
And uh he did n't say this now /.
but he told that the back kind of came off and he saw half of the woman 's body /.
One of the most compelling reasons searchers say they believe this guy very much is that they say he gave them some clues as to things they would find buried deep within that garbage around that same area where he claims he saw a body things like a plastic pool /.
He said that there was a dirt road buried under all that garbage /.
Well they found those things and a couple of other items that he said would be there /.
The problem is they just have n't found any sign at all of Natalee Holloway /.
but they want to clear that place out and just feel satisfied that they looked as best they could because it 's disturbing /.
I mean his story has panned out in some ways /.
so they do n't want to give this up /.
Well that 's the question I have for you Michelle /.
So are you saying that the authorities uh looked into this guy 's story early on and they kind of pooh - poohed it and then EquuSearch came in a couple weeks later and said wait a sec , wait a sec , let 's give this guy a shot here and they followed up on it /?
Yeah pretty much /.
Uh the witness told us directly that in the beginning he felt like nobody was believing his story /.
But we talked to a high level source in law enforcement /.
and it turns out they did check it out /.
Hm /.
They sent the FBI out there with a dog /.
But EquuSearch says hey maybe we can do something more thoroughly here /.
We can bring out teams of dogs /.
But here 's the thing /.
They still have n't found one sign of her /.
but uh they are determined to keep it up through the weekend at least /.
Alright Michelle Kosinski as always thanks a lot /.
And as Michelle reported Natalee 's mother Beth Holloway Twitty met with the lead prosecutor in the investigation this afternoon Karin Janssen where she told Janssen about a girl came forward said she had an encounter with Joran Van Der Sloot the chief suspect /.
And on our program last night Beth told me the story /.
A beautiful eighteen year old blonde - headed girl from New Jersey um you know was able to recount an encounter that she had with Joran Van Der Sloot Deepak Kalpoe and Satish Kalpoe during the month of April oh five /.
And what did she say happened /?
you know it 's a pretty long scenario /.
We have a lot of details /.
Um you know the main thing to to sum it up as you know Joran how he entered this establishment /.
I believe that you know if you enter on the right side you have to have a valid ID /.
You enter Carlos N' Charlie 's on the left side you must have some type of I do n't know if it 's a VIP pass or what to enter /.
but Joran enters the establishment on the left side +approaches these group of tourist /.
Um you know it 's interesting how he is able to um try to work his way in and connect establish himself in uh Carlos N' Charlie 's /.
Was walking her around and these other tourists and was able to point out Satish and Deepak Kalpoe /.
They 're sitting ironically in the same corner the same stools that they were seated at in the picture that 's been all over international media /.
So that must be their spot where they wait while Joran is working /.
And um you know it was so interesting how everyone in the casino knew Joran /.
you know he knew everyone was greeting all the guys with this grip handshake /.
All the girls approach him with a kiss on the cheek /.
It was interesting how um you know he was able to order these group of girls by just merely leaning over the bar and ordering three shots of one fifty - one one for himself and three for the tourists with no money /.
So he 's got an open uh tab at Carlos N' Charlie 's /.
able to run a tab /.
And you know then you notice that in a evening 's proceeding he 's even approaching these girls getting close to closing time /.
Did /.
So that 's another unique pattern that he has /.
did she say uh anything about uh violence /?
No she did n't say anything about violence /.
but what I was looking for was a history is a predatory type behavior which I think Joran and Deepak and Satish have and how tightly connected the three are /.
Now i- /.
Joining me now is the private investigator who has been uh working with Natalee 's family TJ Ward and his associate Harold Phipps /.
Gentlemen thanks very much uh for coming on the program /.
+Appreciate it /.
Thank you /.
TJ let me start with you on this issue of this woman uh who came up uh to Beth /.
Have you been able to follow up on that /.
and how relevant do you think it is /?
Uh we have n't followed up with it /.
Um Beth and I have talked about it /.
and we will be following up on it uh here shortly /.
is it relevant /?
I mean a lot of my viewers wrote in saying alright so what /.
this guy 's a pickup artist /.
how does that really impact the case /?
Well it just shows it 's a pattern of um what his activity is when he hangs out at Carlos N' Charlie 's /.
I mean and trying to pick women up and take them from the bar and whatever he 's doing with them after that /.
But if there 's no violence associated with that does that help you in the investigation /?
Well again we do n't think there was a violent issue with him with Natalee /.
We think probably +something has happened to Natalee /.
and they panicked and then went forth and did what they were supposed to do /.
I mean there 's issues that 's come up /.
Um um well we feel something happened when Natalee was with them /.
What do you mean by that /?
Either she either passed out regurgitated /.
um something had happened /.
And on top of that now there 's a statement that 's come up from Joran Van Der Sloot that he 's given to the police uh one of twenty - two statements he 's given by the way that um Deepak had uh raped her and killed her on the beach /.
So at this point what the police have you know again we 're unaware because we 're not getting any information from law enforcement /.
so we have to go on the course of information that we 're gathering on behalf of the family /.
Well let me ask Harold how do you all know that /?
I mean that information for example about that particular statement that TJ was just mentioning /.
How do we know that /?
Yeah how do you know that that statement was actually made by Joran Van Der Sloot /?
Oh we do n't /.
This is the statements that were being attributed to us on those /.
Uh since we have n't interviewed Joran we do n't know exactly what he has said /.
but some of that statement has been let out /.
and uh through a chain of different individuals uh uh they have told us uh what the statement was /.
TJ just so I 'm clear where are you getting that from that that statement was made by Joran about Deepak /?
I have seen a copy of the statement from one of the local newspapers here um Diario /.
Um Jossy Mansur produced and showed me a copy of that statement that uh Joran Van Der Sloot made um the last time that I was here in Aruba /.
and uh he conveyed it from Dutch into English and uh showed me the statement /.
Uh TJ are you in any trouble there /?
I mean there 's been a lot of discussions about the authorities getting uh annoyed about you knocking on doors and things like that /.
Well it 's not that /.
Um there was some /.
the Aruban authorities /-
and we 've had conversations about this /.
This is squared away /.
It 's been straightened out /.
Um there was uh some evidence that leaked out to the fact that had an arrest warrant for my arrest on Wednesday and that I was working without a work permit and I was going to be deported by law enforcement and Wednesday night the law enforcement was looking for me to arrest me /.
Uh all that is untrue /.
and I want to make that perfectly clear /.
Uh this was brought up by another media station here on the island that uh made claim to that /.
but I can to assure /.
Alright /.
It 's not true /.
We 'll move on /.
Alright /.
Yes /.
Alright /.
Um uh Harold finally this landfill /.
Uh are you hopeful uh that EquuSearch is going to find something /?
How credible do you think that witness is who says that he saw three men dumping what looked like a blonde body /?
Well uh as a retired FBI agent I 'm always hopeful for an outcome /.
Uh we interviewed the individual at length /.
and having experienced hundreds if not thousands of interviews during my thirty - one years uh this guy was very uh online /.
He did n't go mm ah /.
I mean he was like telling a story /.
and it did n't appear to me at all like he was coached or practiced /.
Mhm /.
He just told a story uh from the beginning to the end /.
and I believe him /.
I think there was something there /.
if there is the body , whether it 's still there is another story /.
Mhm /.
There has been uh a period of time since then /.
and it could have been removed again /.
But uh his story I think is credible /.
We also had a /-
TJ /.
Sorry go ahead /.
finish up Harold /.
No go ahead /.
I was just going to a- /-
I 'm out of time /.
I was going to ask TJ bottom line do you think that you 're going to be able to crack the case in the next uh couple weeks /?
Well it depends /.
I believe that law enforcement uh since the FBI 's been here has been working very credibly /.
Mhm /.
And uh I believe that they have something um that 's probably solid enough and hopeful uh come September fourth that Joran Van Sloot will stay where he 's positioned right now /.
Mhm /.
and that there 'll be additional arrests in this matter from uh parties and individuals that waited we already know that are possibly involved in this disappearance /.
Alright /.
TJ Ward and Harold Phipps thanks a lot guys for taking the time /.
Really appreciate it /.
Coming up two former jurors in the Michael Jackson case writing tell - all books about the case /.
They now apparently say Jackson is guilty /.
and they 're apparently saying that they broke all kinds of rules in the jury room sneaking in tapes of news reports /.
An insider on the new books joins me next /.
And it 's been a month since this man went missing on a honeymoon on a Mediterranean cruise /.
Police now looking into three men who might 've had something to do with his disappearance /.
maybe foul play /.
And our weeklong series Manhunt Sex Offenders on the Loose wraps up tonight /.
We 're trying to get these guys before they strike again /.
We 'll check in with Erin Runnion five year old daughter Samantha raped and killed by a sex offender /.
Your email abrams report at MSNBC dot com /.
Please include your name where you 're writing from /.
I respond at the end of the show /.
New York Daily News today reports that jurors are saying there were all sorts of shannanigans going on in the jury room at the Michael Jackson case , that a juror wanted to convict Jackson smuggled in a medical dictionary to prove Jackson fits the definition of a pedophile /.
She was later she says intimidated into changing her vote to not guilty /.
Same juror we told you about yesterday Eleanor Cook who 's reportedly writing a tell - all book titled Guilty as Sin Free as a Bird /.
News also reports another allegation that quote another juror sneaked a forbidden video of Court TV broadcast featuring the prosecution friendly Dianne Dimond and Nancy Grace to the jury room but a faulty VCR prevented a sneak peak /.
And then a quote gang of three female jurors were such rabid Jackson fans that they cooed not my Michael when the panel discussed the felony charges against the pop idol /.
Yikes /.
Stacy Brown MSNBC analyst author of Michael Jackson the Man Behind the Mask and a name who keeps popping up with all these books /.
Stacy are you writing any of these books first of all /?
No I 'm not /.
Alright /.
But you actually talked to these jurors about writing a book /.
That 's correct /.
Alright /.
and you were approached alright /.
I was approached /.
And so they are saying the things that the Daily News reports , are they not /?
Well they are saying a lot more than just that /.
What else they saying /?
Um well eh let 's just clear up with the medical book /.
She did n't actually bring it into the deliberation room /.
the jurors were meeting /.
They rendezvoused at a juvenile hall in Santa Maria /.
and she bought it there /.
and as they were getting into the van they ordered it to put it back in her car /.
but she wanted them to understand Ellie Cook this is that this fits Michael to a tee /.
So she wanted them to know Michael Jackson 's guilty , he 's a pedophile /.
and then what /?
Then she just caved /?
She says she was pressured /.
Think she was threated /.
and they were threatening to throw her off the jury /.
Come on /.
this is the one who 's been wanting to write a book since the beginning , right /?
Yeah absolutely /.
Her granddaughter had put out feelers since she was picked for the jury /.
What other kind of shannigans were going on back there , do they say /?
Well um they mentioned um as you had mentioned in your open about the Court TV video /.
Someone had apparently taped some Court TV um stuff /.
and they tried to play it /.
Uh apparently it was a malfunction in the video tape /.
Mhm /.
Well let me give the juror 's explanation for this /.
And /.
This is Paula Coccoz /.
we talked to her today juror number ten /.
It 's number four /.
Uh the bailiff brought in a TV with a VCR so we could review the sheriff 's interview /.
and we went to put in the tape /.
The tape was marked Court TV /.
The people at the courthouse had left this tape in the VCR /.
We told the bailiff about this /.
and he seemed concerned about whether or not we reviewed the tape /.
We told them we did n't watch it /.
We did n't find out until later what was on the tape /.
Yeah /.
according to Ellie though someone taped that show /.
It was n't left there /.
Um and there was a problem /.
Now I know that someone else mentioned that there was a problem as well with a VCR /.
but if you remember well the interview with the sheriff and the young boy was on a disk and not a VCR /.
And this is number five /.
Uh this is again the Daily News /.
That Cook uh admits that she frequently winked at Jackson 's mother um Katherine in court and exchanged wardrobe tips with the entertainer 's mom which resulted in them wearing the same colors on certain days /.
Ellie Cook talked about that yeah /.
She mentioned that they would wink and nod at each other /.
I do n't understand /.
So on the one hand this juror 's saying I was convinced he was guilty you know /.
and they 're saying oh she was trying to bring in a medical text /.
and on the other hand she 's sitting there winking at Katherine Jackson talking to her about what clothes they 're going to wear /.
Saying everything was going to be okay /.
She /-
And that 's why you did n't believe this story /.
That 's why I do n't yeah ah /.
That 's why you would n't write the book /.
I 'm not writing it because I just think that there 's a lot of issues with this /.
if you felt that this guy was guilty , you felt he was a pedophile , he lives in your community , he 's a very powerful member of your community why let him free then /?
Do you just not believe these jurors /?
Is that the problem /?
I just do n't believe them /.
Why /?
I mean they 're making this up for money /?
It 's just /-
well uh you know I think in both their cases they feel now in retrospect maybe we made a mistake /.
And see I can live with that if that 's what they are saying /.
but they 're not saying that /.
They 're saying that they believed all along he was guilty /.
and I 'm having a hard time with that /.
Alright Stacy uh stick around for a minute /.
Joining me now NBC News legal analyst former prosecutor Susan Filan and attorney and Celebrity Justice executive producer Harvey Levin criminal defense attorney Daniel Horowitz /.
Harv what do you make of /-
Look you 've followed this close /.
What do you make of all this /?
Well I think Eleanor Cook is a wacko Dan /.
and I think if any of these allegations are true these jurors need to be prosecuted /.
I mean this is jury tampering from within the jury if these allegations are true /.
And if there is ever to be a fair celebrity trial again especially in California somebody needs to say look we are drawing the line /.
You 're not going to get books at the end of the rainbow and do things inappropriate /.
If it pans out it 's true I think Tom Sneddon himself should prosecute without respect to whether it would have been pro or anti Michael Jackson /.
So Susan let 's assume for a minute it 's true /.
Again you 're the prosecutor /.
and you 're sitting there going are you kidding me /?
There were two or three jurors who wanted to convict /.
and they caved because they were pressured or whatever /.
You ca n't do anything , can you /?
Nothing /.
eh game over /.
You ca n't take an appeal from an aquittal /.
The problem that I have with this is as members of the media we had an awfully difficult time with access to this trial /.
If this is going to set a precedent to shut media out because these highly publicized celebrity trials yield these faulty verdicts she 's doing far far more harm than she could ever understand /.
Yeah but let 's forget about the media stuff /.
I mean the bottom line is the prosecutors ca n't do anything about this , right /?
I mean if the jurors were tampering with evidence , if they were playing with evidence et cetera back there the prosecutors have to just suck it up and be depressed /.
There 's no remedy /.
They have to eat it /.
It 's over /.
Daniel I mean Stacy does n't really believe them /.
but what do you think /?
Well Dan I believe them /.
You know jurors are people /.
We expect them to be perfect little robots doing what the judge says /.
and they do n't /.
They 're going to watch television /.
I 'm sure they all watch your show /.
and they watched Susan try to convict Michael Jackson /.
but then I hope they listened to me and to reason /.
But the bottom line is they reached a fair and just verdict /.
You have to trust people and nail those attempts to control and hypercontrol this case /.
Just backfired /.
It made the jurors feel isolated /.
and now they 're all quiet /.
They wo n't talk to us about what really went on /.
Okay here 's my problem /.
It 's this woman saying she was forced and bullied right into reaching the verdict that she did /.
and there she is saying I did n't like the way that this woman snapped at me talking about the accuser 's mother et cetera /. /.
You know Dan I do n't even talk to juries afterwards unless I win because you 're always going to hear things like that /.
People in a jury room are in a bar room brawl /.
It 's not supposed to be pretty /.
and when it 's over there 's always second thoughts and regrets /.
but it 's the system /.
and it works /.
Harvey you know what /.
eh hey hey if I may say /-
But Dan your point is that /-
You know a bar room brawl is one thing /.
They were acting like outlaws if these allegations are true /.
Right /.
And you know I agree Susan that the prosecutors ca n't do anything to Michael Jackson /.
but they certainly can do something to the jurors /.
and I think it is more important right now to say /-
I 'm telling you Dan you and I have covered a lot of trials in this city /.
and we 've seen a lot of weird things happen since OJ Simpson with books and everything else /.
If jurors realize that there 's a back end if you will which is a Hollywood term to these trials and if they get caught so what they get caught but they can still publish a book if they believe that everything is going to change in this city /.
let me ask you /.
Harv here 's the thing that I do n't understand /.
And this is why Stacy made the right call on this /.
Alright Stacy may say he did n't believe them whatever /.
I do n't think that many people are going to buy this book /.
Is that Stacy /?
I did n't either /.
Is that the real reason you did n't want to write the book Stacy /?
Well no no that 's not the b- /-
You did n't think you were going to make any money /?
Come on /.
That 's the real reason , is n't it /?
No /.
the real reason is Dan believe it or not I have a conscience /.
I wrote Man Behind the Mask with Bob Jones because I believed in Bob Jones /.
and I still believe in the material /.
I do n't believe in this material /.
uh Harvey do you agree with me that the book 's not really going to sell much /?
Absolutely /.
For two reasons /.
Number one I think it would have been a better book if he would have been found guilty /.
And secondly I think the credibility of the authors um mean a whole lot /.
and eh you know I just think everything is so off - kilter people are n't going to be particularly interested in it /.
Yes /.
Yeah /.
Uh reminder /.
you can hear from uh those two jurors who now say Jackson 's guilty premiere of Rita Cosby Live and Direct Monday night at nine PM eastern right here on MSNBC /. /.
Susan Filan 's going to stick around /.
Harv Daniel Horowitz thanks a lot /.
appreciate it /.
Coming up no clear explanation for what happened to a honeymooner who disappeared from a Mediterranean cruise last month /.
Police now focusing on three men seem to be telling some inconsistent stories /.
And our series on wanted sex offenders around the country concludes tonight /.
It 's called Manhunt Sex Offenders on the Loose /.
College student Dru Sjodin allegedly raped and murdered by a sex offender two years ago /.
Her mother joins us along with Erin Runnion whose five year old girl was raped and murdered by a convicted sex offender /.
Coming up , man disappears on his honeymoon cruise ship /.
Police on the case focusing now on three men seem to be telling some inconsistent stories /.
More on the investigation coming up /.
but first the headlines /.
Hello I 'm Milissa Rehberger /.
Here 's what 's happening /.
The Russian military is racing to rescue seven sailors trapped in a minisubmarine six hundred and twenty - five feet below the surface of the Pacific Ocean /.
The sub got snagged in a giant fishing net /.
A US Airforce jet carrying robotic undersea vehicles is on its way from California to aid in that rescue /.
It 's expected to arrive in ten to twelve hours /.
It is unclear how much oxygen remains onboard that minisub /.
The Russian Navy 's chief spokesperson says there may only be about twelve hours worth while another official says there 's more than twenty - four hours left /.
British Prime Minister Tony Blair announced the crackdown on terrorists and extremists in the wake of the London bombing /.
He proposed new deportation measures against people who advocate violence /.
And a new anti-insurgents operation underway in western Iraq /.
US marines and Iraqi troops launched Operation Quick Strike in the Euphrates River Valley /.
That is northwest of Baghdad /.
That 's where twenty - two marines were killed this week /.
Back to the Abrams Report /.
Exactly a month after twenty - six year old George Smith vanished from a Royal Caribbean ship cruising in the Mediterranean NBC News has learned federal investigators are now focusing on three men who were traveling on the cruise ship called Brilliance of the Seas two Russian brothers who live in Brooklyn and one man who lives in California /.
The attorney for the California man issued this statement /.
We 've been cooperating with the FBI and the US Attorney 's Office in their investigation /.
and we 'll continue to do so /.
However we 've been asked by the authorities not to speak with the media while the investigation is pending /.
and we intend to honor that request /.
This photo taken the day shows what appears to be blood on the awning below the cabin where Smith and his wife were staying /.
Smith was traveling on his honeymoon and had left Barcelona Spain on June twenty - ninth /.
what was meant to be a twelve day cruise /.
Halfway through the trip on the morning of July fifth he disappeared /.
He was reported missing later that day when the ship docked in Kusadasi Turkey /.
NBC has also learned that Smith 's new wife Jennifer Hagel has been questioned is not a suspect /.
Two were married on June twenty - fifth in Newport Rhode Island /.
Joining me now former Connecticut prosecutor NBC News uh legal analyst Susan Filan who 's been covering the case closely and Orlando police chief Walter uh Zalisko who was on the same cruise that Smith travelled on as well as forensic expert Larry Kobilinsky /.
Alright so Susan what do you know about the investigation /?
Well NBC news has learned from a law enforcement source that the wife is not a suspect and that they are focusing in on these two Russian brothers as you said who live in Brooklyn /.
The California teen is apparently the key to the case at this point /.
That 's law enforcement 's focus /.
If this young man will talk this could break open what happened to George /.
The key question is is this a tragic accident or is this foul play /?
Right now law enforcement seems to think it 's foul play /.
US attorney Kevin O'Connor said we have reason to believe there could have been foul play here /.
Um alright uh Mister Zalisko do you know anything from your personal experience of having been on the cruise as to what happened /?
Uh good evening sir /.
Uh first I 'd just like to clarify I 'm a police chief in Oak Hill Florida not Orlando /.
Uh now as far as the cruise uh I was on the cruise that uh uh day /.
and the way I became aware of what occured was that uh the morning of the fifth a relative of mine had mentioned that there was blood stain on the canopy beneath her uh balcony /.
at that point we kind of dismissed it /.
We did n't know what was uh going on /.
Uh we then went on our daily excursion /.
However later on into the cruise that day uh the ship 's captain went onto the PA system and made an announcement that uh authorities were on the ship and they were investigating the possibility that an individual had gone overboard during the night or early morning hours /.
When I asked my cousin the uh size of the blood splatter she had indicated it was relatively the size of a small uh dog of a beagle type /.
However viewing those photographs on TV that blood splatter is much larger than uh a small dog /.
Mhm /.
In fact it 's maybe three to four feet in length /.
And then we 've been hearing many stories that uh there were a lot of people going into and out of the state rooms uh which would indicate that the crime scene was not properly secured in the early stages of the investigation /.
Well /.
Alright let me play this piece of sound from one of the passengers who was uh staying right nearby uh this particular uh room /.
We were awakened uh about four in the morning uh by loud yelling coming from the cabin /.
Um it sounded like people uh cheering uh like a drinking contest type thing /.
And he says uh later um chief that he heard a horrific thud /.
Well yeah that would indicate that something did go on there /.
and we know uh that the three individuals were in a room uh with Mister Smith /.
And the question that has to be uh presented to everybody is why is it taking so long for authorities to interview the individual that was in a cabin next door /?
Mhm /.
Any seasoned investigator would know that you would want to conduct your interviews uh of possible witnesses immediately after the crime /.
Yeah /.
Yeah /.
And you would not just interview that individual next door /.
You would have to take a step to interview people above below and to both sides /.
Susan what 's the answer to that /?
But Dan /.
there are jurisdictional problems here /.
You know it 's not a clear cut case as to who gets to prosecute this case /.
Turkey ca n't do anything without a body /.
United States can /.
Fair play of the United States for stepping in /.
fair play to law enforcement for getting involved /.
Jurisdiction is n't clear /.
but they 're working very hard to solve the crime /.
I do n't think the criticism is well placed against law enforcement in this case /.
Also the crime scene oh if you want to call it that was cleaned up by the cruise ship who got their investigators and their lawyers in from what I understand right away to make this go away /.
so I think law enforcement was put in a bad position trying to play catchup /.
and I think they 're doing +an amazing job /.
Larry so uh any chance now based on the fact that things have been cleaned up et cetera to get any usable evidence /?
Well it 's very difficult Dan /.
Uh obviously as we keep saying we do not have a body /.
therefore we do not have a cause or a manner of the death /.
But we do have some physical evidence /.
Unfortunately examination of the photograph uh tells me it was not done the proper way /.
It was n't a forensic photograph /.
So I really do not know how large the stain was in its dimensions /.
but it is pretty clear that there 's a lot of blood there great deal of blood /.
It makes you think that something criminal occured /.
But again getting back to how you solve the crime you got to go to the crime scene /.
and I think there are multiple scenes here /.
Every place there 's blood it 's a crime scene /.
But the most important place is the cabin because that 's presumably where the injury took place /.
Now there was some rumor about some arguments going casino the night before /.
Uh and it could very well be that he was arguing with these individuals /.
so uh that could be the tie the connection /.
and I think good policework would connect the individuals in question with the casino with Mister Smith /.
and that might help us understand what happened /.
this is um a little bit more sound /.
This is again from Cletus Hyman uh who was literally um in a joining or nearby cabin um as to what he heard around he said four in the morning the day before uh Mister Smith went missing /.
At times it sounded like furniture was being actually picked up and dropped /.
and then that horrific uh thud /.
Yeah I mean that sure sounds to me chief like we 're not talking about someone who /-
I mean I guess it 's possible if you 're talking about loud yelling coming /-
Well look if this guy 's right that loud yelling is coming from the cabin right and the wife is not a real suspect here means that there was probably someone else in there /.
Well there absolutely was someone else in that room /.
And what 's interesting is there was a witness who uh had informed ship 's authorities that she had heard a scream uh early that morning /.
And what 's really interesting is uh we do n't know if she 's been interviewed at this point /.
But it was five days later that the ship 's attorneys had begun to question her not law enforcement but ship 's attorneys /.
We will uh continue to follow this /.
Chief Zalisko of the Oakhill Police Department sorry about that Susan Filan Larry Kobilinsky thanks a lot /.
Coming up two mothers both their daughters kidnapped raped killed /.
Join us for the final installment of our series Manhunt Sex Offenders on the Loose /.
And you know I sort of pooh - poohed the idea that two jurors from the Michael Jackson trial are now writing tell - all books saying that they think Michael Jackson 's guilty /.
You respond to me , coming up /.
Abrams Report at MSNBC dot com is where you send your emails /.
Please include your name where you 're writing from /.
I respond at the end of the show /.
Coming up , our series Manhunt Sex Offenders on the Loose continues with two mothers who lost very loved ones to really these monsters , coming up /.
All week we 've been continuing with our series Manhunt Sex Offenders on the Loose /.
In a moment I 'm going to talk with two very courageous mothers who both lost daughters to sex offenders /.
But first I want to highlight some of the wanted sex offenders running free before they strike /.
This time in New York state /.
Tomas Meddaugh is a oh he 's not thirty that guy 's what fifty alright fifty year old white male five foot seven a hundred and sixty - eight pounds with scars near his left eyebrow and shoulder his neck and abdomen /.
He 's got a prior conviction for rape /.
and his current offense involved deviant sexual intercourse with a thirteen year old girl /.
He 's considered armed and dangerous /.
Francisco Paulino is a forty - six year old Hispanic male five foot nine hundred and forty no scars or tattoos that they know of /.
He does have a prior conviction for the knifepoint rape of a fourteen year old girl /.
He 's violated his parole /.
He 's wanted /.
Dion Bryant twenty - four year old black male standing five foot six one fifty - six /.
Convicted for attempted rape /.
three underage girls involved /.
He too has violated his parole /.
Wanted /.
Anyone with information about their whereabouts should call New York 's a hundred most wanted tipline one eight hundred two six two four three two one and keep in mind that these guys really may be dangerous /.
so /-
Now the women you 're about to meet lost their children to vicious predators /.
Samantha Runnion was uh just eleven days away from her sixth birthday when she was kidnapped sexually assaulted and murdered by a man named Alejandro Avila /.
He 's been sentenced to death for those crimes /.
In choosing to destroy Samantha 's life you chose this /.
You chose to waste your life to satisfy a selfish and sick desire /.
You knew it was wrong /.
and you chose not to think about it /.
Well now you have a lot of time to think about it /.
Do n't waste it /.
Write it down so that the rest of us can figure out how to stop you people /.
You 're a disgrace to the human race /.
And Dru Sjodin was a twenty - two year old college student /.
She was abducted and killed /.
Alfonso Rodriguez a man with prior convictions for assaulting women is facing trial accused of kidnapping and murder /.
Convicted he too uh could get the death penalty /.
Joining me now is Samantha Runnion 's mother Erin Runnion and Dru Sjodin 's mother Linda Walker /.
Thanks so much uh for coming on the program /.
We appreciate it /.
Alright Erin let me start with you /.
What do you think the biggest problem is out there when it comes to these sex offenders /?
Well I think that there 's a gross misconception about sex offender crimes /.
I think most do not realize how pervasive the problem is /.
The sex offenders that we have caught are a very small percentage of those that are out there /.
Statistically one in four girls and as many as one in six to ten boys are sexually assaulted before they are eighteen /.
That 's nationwide /.
This problem is much bigger than I think people are realizing /.
And Linda I guess what we 're realizing as we have been highlighting these wanted sex offenders around the country is how many of them are still out there and wanted /.
Well currently there 's um right now uh over a hundred thousand that are missing /.
Unbelievable /.
Uh we know that there 's over five hundred thousand registered /.
So yes there 's a vast amount that are running uh through the system /.
That 's a May of two thousand five um statistic /.
but as far as those before that time and date /.
Um Linda eh how much has this eh when I say changed your life I mean in addition to the obvious loss of your daughter but in terms of what you are doing everyday with your life /.
both of you have devoted much of your lives to this cause now /.
Linda why do n't you tell me a little bit about what you 've been doing /.
Well um I 've been working with um er pardon me Byron Dorgan Senator of North Dakota /.
um working legislation on what has been uh called Dru 's Law which we hope will be a national sex +offender uh database through computer /.
And um obviously we know that this nation is more and um they 're able to access cross you know state lines /.
so I think it 's important that uh people of predators living amongst us across you know the country and be vigilant uh besides uh leaving the pressure on them /.
Mhm /.
Yeah /.
Erin uh every time I listen to that tape of you um talking to uh your dau- I get chills /.
Um was it at all uh cathartic for you to be able to stand across from him /?
Definitely /.
Definitely I to say what I said to him /.
I needed to address him /.
And I feel like I got it off my chest you know /.
I hope to never ever see him again /.
The whole trial process is really built around the defendant /.
and um it was very important to me that I bring it back around and make it about Samantha because that 's what it was really about /.
Do you watch these other stories uh in the news /.
and does it just get your blood boiling as you see eh these cases where was on the loose should have been arrested could 've been /.
You know the technology is there /.
so yes it infuriates me /.
I ca n't understand why we 're so behind in terms of tracking sex offenders /.
and I really think it 's because people do n't real- /-
there 's no reason that there should n't be a nationwide movement to stop these people . To have them register at the very least have them their driver 's licenses /.
If they do n't they go on a most wanted list /.
it 's made public nationwide /.
At the very least every state could do that /.
it adds to state revenue /.
it does n't take away /.
It 's a good way to track them /.
And I have to just on a personal note applaud Linda /.
I met her before they had found Dru /.
and I 'm so sorry for your loss /.
I think you 're just amazing /.
You 're doing such a job /.
Well as well for you too /.
Thank you /.
Linda are you psychologically prepared uh for this trial /?
I mean eh you know you can tell from seeing on that tape that obviously it 's not easy stuff /.
I mean to sit there next to these guys /.
You know it 's just another part of this whole sick story /.
there 's no script for it /.
I do n't know if anyone could ever be prepared /.
Um obviously it 's something that um we look to have it put behind us so we can really dwell more on what Dru gave us in her life and not how tragically she was taken from us /.
And also I have to say that what both of you are doing in working with legislators uh to move forward uh to not just say we 're going to only look past /.
Both of you are doing /.
and that 's why we 're so um glad and proud to have you both on the program /.
It 's because of what both of you are doing to have things change /.
um and I think that is what 's /-
Go ahead Linda /.
Well and uh thanks goes to you and to the media to help us /.
Absolutely /.
Obviously we could n't scream loud enough uh to bring the attention /.
so our hat is off to all of you as well /.
Yeah /.
Yeah and that 's /-
And to realize you know why we 're out here doing what we 're doing on the scale that we 're able to /.
and that 's why I have to tell you on this special series we 're doing I 'm just getting so tired of hearing these stories about these guys where they were always on the loose and people say oh you know it would have been nice if he was captured /.
Tired of it /.
and as a result you know we 're doing the little bit that we can /.
but you guys are the ones who are really going to get things done /.
Your voices your presence um I think is really the difference /.
and that 's why I thank you both so much for coming on the program /.
Well thank you /.
Well thank you /.
it 's /.
And you know it 's so important we know too /.
Absolutely /.
Absolutely /.
It 's so important that people realize at home that in our own homes in our own lives we can work to prevent these crimes /.
It is really just about uh communicating with neighbors getting a watch going in your community talking /-
Report every suspicious behavior there is /.
You never know /.
It leads to convictions time and time again /.
and Linda Walker thank you both so much for coming on the program /.
Absolutely uh /.
Thank you /.
We really appreciate it /.
Be right back /.
Thank you /.
Thank you Dan /.
I 've had my say /.
now it 's time for your rebuttal /.
Last night I said if the two jurors in the Michael Jackson case are really now saying that he 's guilty that 's shameful /.
Leslie Birdwhistell from Bowling Green Kentucky /.
Man you /.
Ca n't these people step away from the trial and the ten other jurors take in some information that was not presented in court and change their minds about the verdict /?
Uh No /.
It 's too important /.
They saw the evidence /.
The only thing that might 've changed their minds this quickly I think is money or peer pressure neither of which are very good reasons /.
David Becker from Bradenton Florida /.
Why 's it so difficult to believe these jurors believed Michael Jackson was guilty but did n't believe there was sufficient evidence to convict /?
Uh maybe Dave /.
but the Daily News reported that they quote flip - flopped /.
And in our weeklong series Manhunt Sex Offenders on the Loose trying to stop wanted sex offenders before they strike Chris O'Rourke from Gardner Massachusetts /.
I 'm happy that someone 's finally trying to do something to ward off these child attacks before rather than focus on them after /.
from West Hollywood Californ- /-
Dan I know your intentions are good /.
but your drive to stop sex offenders before they commit a crime sounds a bit like a southern lynch mob in the sixties /.
Really /.
it 's a lynch mob mentality to want to find wanted sex offenders /.
Your emails Abrams Report one word at MSNBC dot com /.
we go through them at the end of the show /.
Coming up , how one penny pinching motorist thought he was getting back at the cop who gave him a speeding ticket /.
Did n't really work /.
Our Oh Please is up next /.
Oh please you ever wondered how to get back at the police for writing you a speeding ticket /?
One man in Moorhead Minnesota thought he could do just that by finding good use for all /-
The driver paid for the one hundred and twenty dollar ticket with twelve thousand pennies /.
Seattle man was issued a speeding citation for driving seventy in a fifty mile per hour zone /.
Speedster showed up to court hauling a small garbage can full of pennies /.
Court had the final laugh though making the guy wait at court until every was counted offsite at a bank /.
That does it for us tonight /.
Coming up next Hardball with Chris Matthews /.
Have a great weekend /.
We got a big week next week /.
so we 'll see you /.
Should the peace include military reservists /?
And why wo n't they let Bob Novak speak /?
Let 's play Hardball /.
