And in following up on the situation in Lebanon , we are joined by our correspondent there , Mohammed Gharib .
Mohammed , to begin with , uh , and after the latest statements by Fouad Siniora and also the address given by Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah to the opposition and to all the Lebanese , has the political debate between the authorities and the opposition entered a phase of dangerous disclosures in your opinion ?
Well , yeah , this is apparently the case yeah , Laure .
But , yeah , the doors of dialogue , in all cases so far as the two sides are saying , remain open .
Umm .
Yeah , but the opposition in return , I mean , yeah , says that any dialogue uh , uh , at least if , yeah , yeah , it takes place between the two sides , will only be alongside the popular opinion .
That is , the opposition so far is saying that the street is the main path to , yeah , yeah , changing the government .
And here , I have to point out that there is a fallacy , it seems that the media people --
the opposition is so far at the stage of demanding a change in the government and not the toppling of the government , which means that it is demanding a national unity government , yeah , yeah , or a change in the government through , yeah , yeah , I mean , yeah , keeping Prime Minister Siniora as Prime Minister and some of the current ministers , provided that , I mean , an agreement is reached to add some ministers to this current government .
Yes .
Well , Mohammed , uh , there is little hope , uh , on the issue of dialogue .
Yes , okay , Sir the report called for dialog with Syria and Iran , but Bush doubted neighboring countries ' taking part in the talks at an international conference to support Iraq .
Does n't this contradict the administration 's approach to dealing with the Baker - Hamilton report ?
Yes , first let me explain .
There is a call for an international conference and there is a call for a regional conference .
the international conference , it appears that the Bush administration is not encouraged and is not enthusiastic about it .
Abdul Aziz Al - Hakim expressed this when he was in Washington this position as did Iraqi President Talabani .
But what is striking is that there is a possibility uh for a call for a regional conference .
In my opinion , this , uh , is being encouraged by Washington and perhaps through this conference , there will be a way in for , uh , the United States of America to talk to Syria and Iran .
Syria and Iran will of course be involved in this regional conference should it be held and I do n't think it would be wise and it would not be objective not to invite them to a conference dealing with Iraq 's regional neighbors .
The question is about the American position .
Will Washington take this conference as a way of initiating a dialog with Syria and Iran or will it content itself with Syria and Iran 's participation being simply the outer limits or upper ceiling for talks with Syria and Iran at this stage ?
Yes , from Washington , Mr. Subhi Ghandour , director of the Arab Dialog Center , thank you very much .
Ah undoubtedly ah a very hasty project , especially that the Hebrew State tried to implement this project alone , from the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea .
And it was proved to them with certainty that the project is ineffective economically , as it will cost one and a half billion dollars .
So they tried using their well - known means to transfer this project to another agency to implement it and finance it , while they reap the fruits from it .
Aha , aha .
They have many goals ah for such a project , the most important of which is to build one hundred new settlements they have been planning to establish in the Negev .
Ah .
But now the fear is that they plan to build them across the extension of the new canal line from the Red Sea to the Dead Sea under various headers , including the headers ah of development and architecture and ah establishing new settlements .
And since the subject has become open in Jordan for everyone , there is no guarantee that the new construction projects that would be established on this line might reach the hands of the Zionists .
Aha .
And they might repeat the story as they started it in Palestine by building settlements , and the eastern mountains will become occupied to the Dead Sea and Araba Valley , occupied by the Zionists .
Aha , aha .
This project is extremely dangerous , except --
would n't it also contribute to completely connect the Palestinian and Jordanian economy to the Israeli I mean , what generates from it , may be , of demographic , economic and development projects .
Yes , more than this , I say ah this project is one of the American - Israeli projects in the region which aim in the end at incorporating ah Israel in the Jordanian society and in the Arab society ah and marketing it in this way .
Huge tremendous joint projects ah ah that guarantee the security and stability of the region as it is said , but they will bring us very big losses .
Aha --
This project has engineering damages , environmental damages , military damages and political damages on Jordanian society .
May , you made reference at the beginning of this meeting to the butcher child or the Turbini in Egypt .
What are the details ?
Well , he is nicknamed , uh , uh , like this , Turbini , and he is the leader of a murderous gang in Egypt , and he has chosen the railroad tracks as the stage for his crimes .
In any case , we selected from the Qatari newspaper Al - Watan , uh , Amal , an article entitled The Fourth Class in Egypt : the Street Children by Habashi Rushdi , and he discusses , uh , the causes of the appearance of such gangs and such children , uh , in Egypt .
The writer , uh , says that this class , the Fourth Class , is not from families like the three traditional classes , and their armies , who live in the open air also live in a wilderness of ethical values , so there is no discipline , and no upbringing .
And what is striking in this matter is that it is an extension of the class of poor people who live in chaotic neighborhoods that are never reached by the helping hand of the government .
And only as a reminder , May , the streets of Egyptian cities encompass two million children who are runaways from their families , according to the latest statistics ; a very large number , May .
yes , you know , he also says , uh , the author , that the Egyptian street , uh , abandons those with apathy to unknowingly create the most hardened criminals , whose crimes will soon make the headlines of the events pages of the newspapers .
He goes on , By putting the underlying origin of the , uh , street children class in Egypt under the microscope , you will find that one of the most dangerous reasons behind their growth is the chaotic migration from the countryside to the cities , and to a certain extent , the ruralization of the cities and the urbanization of the countryside .
And --
Yes , the unfortunate thing too in all of this , May , is that millions among the wealthy are lost in deep sleep while there are millions of children out in the streets .
Uh , yes , well , and uh , also here the author says : What is required is not for the police to put these children in youth shelters for them to escape and go back to the streets , because the children have searched by themselves for freedom they did not have in their families , so they resorted to the streets , so do not save their lives by using the police , but through social fathers and mothers who will return them to their families and provide their families with security and safety and correct the life of every child among them .
-- basically , it was unanimously agreed upon by the various relevant parties .
To express its determination , the Chinese securities regulatory department compares this stock reform to a die that has been cast .
It takes time to prove whether the stock reform can really meet expectations , and whether any deviations that arise during the stock reform can be promptly corrected .
Dear viewers , the China News program will end here .
This is Xu Li .
Thank you everyone for watching .
Coming up is the Focus Today program hosted by Wang Shilin .
Good-bye , dear viewers .
Hello , dear viewers .
Welcome to Focus Today .
Today , let 's turn our attention to a road cave - in accident that happened in Beijing over the holiday .
Before dawn on January 3 , a sewage pipe leakage accident occurred at the main and side roads of Jingguang Bridge , East Third Ring Road , Beijing Municipality , resulting in the road caving in .
Relevant departments from Beijing Municipality promptly activated emergency contingency plans .
The traffic administration department carried out traffic supervision near the accident scene .
Well , how did the emergency response mechanisms activated by governmental departments operate effectively during the holiday ?
After the holiday , what will be done to handle citizens ' peak commute ?
In addition , what measures did relevant departments take to resolve issues such as waste discharge , heating , and communication , in order to ensure that the lives of citizens were not affected ?
Well , we have invited two honorable guests to the studio today to follow this topic with us .
One of the two honorable guests in the studio is Professor Zhou Hanhua from the Institute of Law of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences .
Hello .
Next is Yang Yang , a host of Beijing Traffic Radio Station .
Hello .
Welcome both of you to the studio to participate in our program .
Well , I especially want to know , ha , how the two of you found out the news on the day of the accident ?
Ah , , about 11:00 m. yesterday , ah , I happened to find out through an SMS when I was outside .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
It happened that I was going to have lunch with a friend , um , at noon .
And then , the friend first sent me an SMS , Uh-huh . saying he would come pick me up to go together .
After that , I received an SMS from 1860 .
Uh-huh , it was through an SMS .
And you , Yang Yang ?
A friend happened to call me .
You were not at work that day ?
No .
The station called me at noon and said something happened at Jingguang Bridge and that I had to go to the station immediately to research the upcoming program .
Uh-huh , that means , er , you found out the accident through an information source at the station .
Right , right , right .
Uh-huh .
Well , like Professor Zhou , I also received this news , ha , through a mobile phone SMS .
At that time , , it can be said that this SMS was among the many , ha , SMS containing New Year wishes , like Happy New Year , received after the start of the New Year .
Uh-huh .
Ah , actually I felt a lot of warmth when I received that SMS .
Although we live in the west instead of the east and it did not affect us much , I think it is very useful , ah , to inform people of this kind of news .
Yes , exceptionally .
Yes , exceptionally .
Well , what in fact was the content of that SMS ?
Let 's take a look via this footage , ha .
I remember the SMS was written like this at that time , saying that , ah , there was a sewage pipe leakage accident on the side road at the southeast corner of Jingguang Bridge at East Third Ring Road , and , well , traffic supervision was implemented near Chaoyang Road , Jingguang Bridge , and East Third Ring Road , and requesting cars to make a detour .
Some car owners said that it was very good that the SMS was sent .
Furthermore , there was one last sentence in that SMS thanking citizens for their cooperation and support .
Ah , after the SMS was sent , , I felt it seems to be the first time that Beijing Municipality , ah , used an SMS to give notification at the time of a public emergency .
I do n't know , all of us are living in Beijing , is this the first time , Professor Zhou ?
Yes , in terms of an official notification , this should be the first time one was sent officially through 1860 .
Uh-huh .
Of course , in private life , people have used SMS countless times to spread news .
Yes .
Other places in the country must have used this too .
Uh-huh , uh-huh .
Must have used this too .
Actually , I remember receiving an SMS like this one last year before it snowed , since snowfall would affect road conditions in Beijing to a rather large extent .
Uh-huh .
However , it did not give people such a special feeling as it did this time .
Uh-huh .
Ah , when an SMS is sent to inform citizens of such an incident , can it be considered a work method or expression of government information transparency ?
Yes , this is indeed through the very successful response to this emergency , ah , by Beijing Municipality , Uh-huh . an extremely good point that is worth pondering deeply , worthy innovation .
Uh-huh .
For instance , previously our news announcements were made through some conventional methods , but this time it was made in the form of a mobile phone SMS .
In fact , this is a method highly emphasized in various countries ' development of e-government .
We usually make it sound like e-government is something unattainable .
Yes , when we talked about e-government in the past , it seemed to be only done through the Internet .
Right .
It seemed that computers , ah , and the Internet , ah , were an expression of e-government , to let people find out information .
Well , presently in fact , e-governments in various countries apply this so - called last multiple - exposure method , such as call centers , such as electronic IDs , and such as , these electronic signatures .
These are quite sophisticated forms .
Uh-huh .
In particular , more terminals , such as , this cable television , ah , , this digital television , ah , and mobile phone SMS , are applied in e-government .
Hence , I think this is , a test of e-government because , as I remember , during SARS in 2003 , people at that time criticized e-government during the spread of SARS , ah .
Uh-huh .
They said that e-government was very good but was not put into use .
Well , this time I think that a short SMS like this can fully create interaction between the government and the public through this e-government form .
Uh-huh .
Yes .
We drive often in Beijing , ha , Yang Yang .
If people were not informed of such a traffic accident through SMS on that day and they continued to head there , what do you think would happen if people did not know what was going on and the jam did not clear ?
Yes .
Ah , well , I think it would have been real paralysis .
This is the most appropriate word to use .
Furthermore , I think that when SMS was used to announce the news , it should be said to have fit the conditions in our China very well .
Why is that so ?
This is because , it should be said that China is the country with the highest SMS usage .
There are probably not as many chances to use SMS in foreign countries compared with domestically , in China , ah .
So , it can be said that penetration was quite high this time , by using the most familiar method , most used by everyone , as well as the most prompt and most convenient method , for the announcement .
Yes , I noticed that many friends , around me received it .
It seems that almost everyone received this SMS .
Yes .
Yes .
The effect was extremely good , ha .
So , how exactly did citizens react ?
Let 's take a look at the reactions of citizens .
-- an SMS .
I saw it was that Jingguang Bridge .
Hey , I say , this is quite good , quite good .
Have you received information like this before ?
No , no .
This was the first time .
The first time ?
Yes , yes .
Well , what do you think of the speed at which the government responded this time ?
Quite fast .
Really quite fast , ah .
So , I did not drive today .
I set out a bit earlier and took the subway here .
Do you think that the response of the government was fast this time ?
Ah , the response was quite fast .
In addition , various media announcements were also quite prompt .
Colleagues and friends also informed one another by phone calls and SMS .
I think this plan was quite speedy .
It seems that through this kind of SMS , citizens responded very well and the effect was excellent , ha .
Well , apart from the , ah , point on information disclosure brought out by this accident , the fact is that the activation of emergency contingency plans by the , ah , government has also left people with a very deep impression .
Let 's find out the situation at that time through some footage .
Well , we know that after the road cave - in accident , ah , ah , traffic police and emergency rescue personnel rushed to the scene , ah , to direct traffic and carry out emergency repair of sewage pipes .
Well , lots of barricade tape has been strung up on the side road in the north - south direction of the accident scene beneath the Jingguang Bridge at East Third Ring Road .
All personnel responsible for the emergency repair of underground sewage pipes , ah , have arrived at their designated locations .
See , through this footage , we see , ah , this --
Uh-huh .
Okay , ah , , this emergency repair worker said that he was there at 4 o'clock .
That means that they arrived at the scene right after the pre-dawn accident occurred .
Well , it can be said that the traffic administration department was activated very quickly after receiving the news .
Well , ah , Yang Yang , you work at Traffic Radio Station , ha , well , and we know that you all gave an extensive live broadcast this morning .
A special program .
Yes , a special program on this traffic .
So , let 's first turn our attention to the impact on traffic after the accident .
Judging from the traffic control measures taken after the accident , as well as the eventual impact caused , what do you think are the effects ?
Actually , concerning this , I think both of you are very familiar with the traffic in Beijing .
Previously we had a statistic , especially for the ring roads in Beijing .
That is , if we have an ordinary fender bender or tailgate accident on a bridge such as the Jingguang Bridge of the Third Ring Road , it might cause the entire Third Ring Road to have bumper - to - bumper traffic jams during these morning and evening peak periods .
Uh-huh .
It might even impact traffic on the Second Ring Road and Fourth Ring Road .
Well , ah , if there is an accident , from the time it occurs until the time all traffic is cleared , it probably takes about half an hour to an hour during peak periods .
Well , we could not imagine imposing temporary traffic restriction measures on a long section of road stretching from Jingguang Bridge to Changhong Bridge from the south all the way to Guomao Bridge , blocking the main and side roads .
Well , the situation would be unthinkable during this peak period that is the first day of work for everyone .
Hence , at that time , before 6:30 a .m . today , before our live broadcast , we moved the broadcast forward , and before the live broadcast we were very worried .
However , actually after the entire day today , I came here right after ending the live broadcast this evening to continue with the live broadcast here , in fact , in Beijing today people indeed experienced an extremely high volume of traffic flow on the roads surrounding the section under traffic control , and indeed there was a very big traffic jam .
Uh-huh .
However , the affected area was not as large as expected .
Moreover , some people made detours once they received the news .
Right .
Psychologically , people felt quite relieved .
Because I know this situation .
Right , like those whom we interviewed just now .
It was easy to handle once everyone understood .
Yes , ah , , a citizen , he said , I set out today before the incident , and I did not drive after I was informed .
That person did not even drive .
Right .
Actually , in this aspect , I think that citizens were really quite cooperative .
For instance , this evening , we , received an SMS .
A friend said , I work on the 12th floor of the China World Trade Center at the Guomao Bridge , ah .
We were discussing that we could go home in fewer cars since everyone was on the same route .
Later on , we suggested to him and said , you , ah , might as well take the subway , because you can directly reach the subway once you get down from the China World Trade Center .
Right .
Hey , he said this was quite a good idea .
Actually , I think everyone was quite cooperative and also quite supportive in this aspect .
Yes , many , viewers not in Beijing may not be quite familiar , ah , with this road section we just mentioned , where , ah , the accident occurred .
Ah , we can take a look later through an animation .
This road represents a main road on East Third Ring Road , with problems on both the main and side roads .
Furthermore , Chaoyang Road is an intersection .
Uh-huh .
Whether it is Chaoyang Road in the east - west direction or the main and side roads of East Third Ring Road in the south - north direction , as we can see from this diagram , it can be said that the area at the main and side roads of East Third Ring Road normally has quite heavy traffic , especially during commuting times .
Well , Chaoyang Road is a very important artery in the east - west direction .
Yes .
When people living in the west want to cross over from the city , they have to go via this road .
Hence , if a traffic accident occurs at this place , we can indeed imagine , ha , how widespread , ah , the extent of the impact will be , such as the number of cars caught in traffic jams .
Yes , actually I think everyone can see that from the buses that cross Jingguang Bridge .
Yes .
As buses that cross the Third Ring Road are currently , right now affected by the Jingguang Bridge accident , ah , the latest results this morning show that 32 bus routes throughout the neighborhood have had to be rerouted .
Uh-huh .
Well , I think that perhaps many friends in other places are wondering how one place is able to accommodate 32 commuter routes .
If the accident did not happen , perhaps everyone would not know that this place could normally have so many --
It is really like this , just look at the bus signs .
Right .
Have not seen so many buses .
Right .
Its effect on people has been extremely extensive .
Yes .
Uh-huh .
Well , what measures did the traffic control department eventually take to direct traffic ?
Our correspondent specially interviewed Director Meng Xianlong , Mr. Meng Xianlong , of the Command Center of the Beijing Municipal Traffic Administration .
Let 's hear what Director Meng said .
Um , our traffic control department immediately activated the traffic emergency response plan .
In the roads close to where the problem emerged , we first set up traffic diversion points for traffic control at the southern and northern ends .
In this way , all vehicles going along East Third Ring Road had to make a detour to go on roads on the east and west sides .
East Third Ring Road is a traffic artery in the east of Beijing that links the north and the south .
In order to ensure smooth traffic in the eastern district , we formulated a set of traffic diversion control plans .
We set up traffic diversion points at 68 locations along East Second Ring Road , East Fourth Ring Road , West Dawang Road , ah , and related roads to the east and west , and deployed more than 210 additional police officers to divert and direct traffic .
It can be said that measures were very promptly taken .
Ah , today is the first workday after the New Year holiday .
Well , what exactly was the situation this morning ?
We specially sent a reporter to the scene this morning to shoot some footage .
Let 's take a look at the situation this morning through this footage .
Well , from this footage , we can see that , ha , at East Third Ring Road , ah , near Guanghua Bridge , the roads here that lead to the vicinity of Jingguang Bridge have come under control and , well , various kinds of signs have also been placed at very conspicuous locations .
Although the outdoor temperature in Beijing has fallen to minus 3 degrees , the traffic police deployed additional manpower on the roads to direct traffic , ah , and guide drivers in making detours .
Well , since direction of traffic was carried out on the periphery , the number of vehicles at the section of the accident was significantly less than usual , with road traffic very orderly .
Ah , it can be said , ah , Yang Yang , citizens , regardless of whether they took the bus or drove , their mentality , in terms of being understanding or calm , ah , was a very important factor in having orderly traffic at the scene .
Uh-huh .
Right , right .
, through your listeners , what kind of feedback did you find out from them ?
Actually , this morning , some listeners , ah , also happened to tell us about it via mobile phone SMS .
Since we know that Jingguang Bridge is located in the CBD district , well there are many office buildings , ah , a lot of them , as well as quite a lot of friends who get up early in the morning to go to work .
Therefore , they sent SMS saying , hey , it is unusual , ah , for me to be walking to the bus station today or going to take the bus .
Well , it is unusual for me to enjoy a very pleasant morning .
We then reminded everyone to wear extra clothing .
This shows that when people encounter such kind of emergency , they have started to be able to face it with a very calm and pleasant state of mind .
I think that this mentality in facing emergencies , in one respect shows a great change of mentality that Beijing citizens now have after enduring several tests in the past , and a kind of calmness and maturity after having experienced frustrations .
On the other hand , I think it can also fully show the level of people 's satisfaction with emergency mechanisms of the operational departments of the government in handling this incident .
That is , they think that the government has tried its best .
Well , in this respect , we citizens should also contribute our efforts .
Uh-huh .
As such , in this regard , I think people 's mentality can become very calm .
Uh-huh .
Well , Professor Zhou , from this perspective , is this one highly positive effect achieved after information was disclosed ?
Yes .
In terms of citizens ' mentality .
Yes , in fact it can be seen from this particular case .
That is , when the government was handling this kind of public emergency , well , it went from a traditionally unilateral administrative management method , well , a method in which information was quite delayed , to disclosure and transparency of information , and very fast as well .
We know that in the past , disclosure of information had to be reported to higher authorities , level by level , until the highest authorities had given approval , before information could be disclosed .
Time was lost .
Well , yes , the State Council has , er , put forth a regulation concerning the establishment of public early warning mechanisms .
That is , related information that can be publicized will be publicized first , in order to guide people in what to do .
In this way , related interaction between the government and the people can be formed .
That is , in modern public management , ah , this is a very good case , that is , of shifting from a kind of unilateral administrative management to public management and to positive interaction between the government and the people .
I think in fact , we can sum up many beneficial experiences from this case and actually extend them to other areas .
Yes , this is when we look at this case from the perspective of traffic .
Traffic was the first thing to be impacted when this , cave - in accident occurred .
However , this accident actually involved many underground pipes , such as sewage pipes , ah , or water , ah , and gas , ah , pipes , that affect the lives of citizens in many other aspects .
Yes .
Yang Yang , do you know how many pipes there are underground ?
Right now , there should be seven main types of pipes buried underground .
They include those like you just mentioned , as well as pipes like those for heating and communication , among others .
Truly , these pipes are closely linked to the lives of citizens .
Closely linked .
Yes , therefore besides our attention to the traffic issue just now , people are also very concerned , ah , with the situation after the accident , with other aspects affecting citizens ' lives .
Let 's take a look again at this footage of the situation of dealing with the current scene .
Ah , according to our understanding of the situation , the Beijing Municipal Construction Commission , ah , the Communication Commission , ah , and telecommunication , traffic , and other departments have assigned personnel to participate in emergency repair work .
Relevant departments said that they will adopt a full range of measures to minimize the level of impact on people 's daily lives and work , in order to ensure stable order in society during the recovery period .
Well , looking at the government 's response to this cave - in accident , ah , we should say it was very prompt with traffic management and emergency repair , ah , because it involved various aspects of life .
Well , ah , Professor Zhou , as this incident involved many departments after it took place , how do you think the various departments should coordinate between themselves ?
Yes .
This is also --
It is not the case that this problem will be totally solved when one department shows up .
Yes , I think as we build this kind , er , of public , this kind of emergency mechanism for public incidents , ah , has been the , most difficult to resolve , an actual problem that has been the most difficult to resolve among administrative management reforms in various countries .
How many groups of people will be sent ?
Many groups .
Yes , this is because social management requires division of labor in society .
It is necessarily a labor division trend that involves many departments , and in addition , a kind of modern management public administration model which is diversified .
Uh-huh .
How can cooperation be formed between departments in this kind of situation ?
Well , sometimes under normal circumstances , sometimes , we often feel that it is very difficult for departments to cooperate with one another .
For instance , there are too many law enforcement departments and , ah , too many administrative departments , and very often in the end , they are unable to coordinate .
However , this time , through the execution of emergency contingency plans by Beijing Municipality this time , ah , it should be said that the response speed of the different departments of Beijing Municipality , as well as the integrated emergency mechanisms , played a great role .
Hence , I think this was also a kind of , er , trial of interdepartmental cooperation mechanisms .
Uh-huh .
It was a very successful , er , response .
I think many good things can be summed up from this .
Yes .
Yang Yang , based on your understanding , ah , as pipes that directly affect many common people 's lives were damaged after the accident , based on your understanding of the situation , how was remedial work carried out ?
For instance , it is very cold during winter in Beijing , and the temperature last night dropped to one of the lowest points recently .
Er , heating pipes were indeed damaged .
Well , at the time , it affected residents living in an area of about 70,000 square meters of Beijing .
Well , , in this regard , the Chaoyang district government did a very good job .
After it , er , received this order from the municipal government , it immediately sent , electric heaters to residents in more than 200 households within this area .
It should be said that many residents spent quite a warm night at home yesterday .
Well , furthermore , in the emergency repair process , ah , it should be said that the heating pipeline was restored relatively quickly .
Hence , over here , I think the municipal government , ah , including sub-district offices , made a lot of effort to take good care of resident households .
I think it was done in a very humanitarian manner .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
Professor Zhou , actually for such a large scale city as Beijing that has more than 14 million people , ah , for such a big city , a suddenly occurring public emergency like this should be said to be relatively common .
Yes .
I think it should be unexpected yet at the same time within expectations .
For instance , we see that other , er , domestic and overseas cities have experienced similar incidents .
Perhaps many overseas cities have had such kind of thing before .
This is because a city is a gathering place for modern life .
It is a highly civilized place , as well as , however , in fact a gathering point for various conflicts , social , economic , security , various aspects of conflict .
Hence it is not at all surprising for such an accident to occur .
The critical thing is --
But the critical thing is how emergency plans are activated after the occurrence of such accidents , and for a city , this is a test of its response capabilities .
Yes .
Yes .
Yes , I think through a few incidents that happened in Beijing Municipality over recent years , such as SARS , the snowfall a few years ago , the heavy rains two years ago , and the road cave - in at East Third Ring Road this time , I think it can be seen that Beijing Municipality 's response capabilities continued to improve each time .
Right .
It can be said that this time , what was done has received favorable comments from everyone .
Um , well , I think , Yang Yang , perhaps you have stronger feelings on this aspect , ah .
Yes .
Because you often have this kind of direct SMS exchange with listeners .
It is because , we , Beijing Traffic Radio Station , has become a part of emergency planning in Beijing .
Well , Beijing Traffic Radio Station is to be activated as a media for emergency plans that are grade three and above .
Well , for instance , as people still vividly remember , at the time of that snowfall just mentioned by Professor Zhou that people still vividly remember , there were no plans .
Beijing Municipality still had no emergency plan .
Well , at that time , it happened that I was hosting the Unblocked All the Way program in the studio that evening .
Well , at that time , traffic was not at all unblocked .
Ah , at that time there was none of this kind of interaction .
It was not clear , it was very congested .
You sat inside the studio and only knew about the heavy snowfall .
You could find out other news only by telephone .
The various methods and channels were extremely unclear .
Well , later , when we experienced that rainfall in Beijing , that rainfall two years ago , as well as some days of sand storms , all channels and early warning mechanisms were activated in quite an orderly manner .
From our perspective as media , I think it was precisely by going through those breaking - in , trials that we could be so calm in handling such an emergency today , ah , and give everyone the most effective announcements and notifications , and instructions .
Yes , therefore , as a local media in this city , it should become a proactive participant when there is a public emergency in the city .
Yes .
It should play its individual role in the process of resolving emergencies .
Ah , apart from this , Professor Zhou , what do you think are the areas for improvement for a city , especially a booming city , when handling this kind of public emergency ?
Right , I think this gave us many revelations , ah .
First , I think one that should be especially important is early warnings and forecasts .
This is because currently , there are , ah , frequently various kinds of risks lurking in cities , ah .
Early warnings and forecasts .
Yes , this kind of early warning and forecast mechanism .
Uh-huh .
It is not only for , this kind of sudden road cave - in , it also includes , for instance , security incidents , ah , in our society , as well as natural disasters , ah , and including public health incidents .
Uh-huh .
That is , this kind of scientific early warning and forecast mechanism must be set up .
Uh-huh .
In this way , you can manage and resolve an abnormal situation by turning it into a normal situation , without evolving into a sudden public emergency .
Uh-huh .
Another thing I want to say is that besides , ah , emergency response and speedy integration mechanisms , I think some corresponding improvements should be made to the release of information , incident investigation , ah , and the relevant post-incident , responsibility system .
In fact , , that is , we should say that the government already has quite a number of relevant systems in this respect .
For instance , we have an administrative investigation system for incidents of major responsibility .
We have regulations on investigation procedures for very major incidents , as well as others such as emergency response methods for handling public health incidents and public health emergencies , among others .
That is to say , we have many corresponding systems .
However , the question is how city management , er , handles these various kinds of perhaps unpredictable cases .
Since we are entering new circumstances of human living , circumstances that contain high risk and have an increasingly developed urbanized life , well , I think corresponding improvements should be made to the formation of a series of systems that includes scientific planning , early warning and forecast , emergency response , accident investigation , and accountability .
Um , well , based on your understanding of the situation , and from an international perspective , what are some better ways of urban management that are worthwhile for us to learn ?
I think , in comparison to China , we should say that urbanization in foreign countries developed earlier and is more widespread .
Their level of development is more advanced than ours .
Although the scale of our urbanization is currently expanding at a rate of 1 % per year , I think , with our economic development being relatively backward , we actually still have many aspects of urban management to learn from foreign countries .
For instance , many of the pipes involved in this incident were basic infrastructure , public utilities industries .
With a background of liberalization , marketization , and privatization , how can the government strengthen supervision of public utilities industries ?
How can a safe , assured system be established ?
Well , we need to learn and manage this .
Uh-huh .
For instance , regarding information disclosure , well , our speed of information disclosure this time was very fast .
However , we still have a lot of work to do in making the information disclosure , er , system more standardized , that is , to really implement a system of levels of responsibility .
Well , we also need to explore how cooperation mechanisms between departments execute cooperation under normal situations and , well , how departments should cooperate with one another under these kinds of public emergency circumstances .
Well , for some of our emergency contingency plans , well , ah , how will these emergency contingency plans withstand these tests ?
We know that currently , many ministries and commissions , as well as people 's governments at the provincial level , along with those at municipal and district levels , have set up emergency contingency plans for public emergencies , but many of them have not been put to the test .
Well , how will they undergo testing ?
These also include some of our command and policy - making systems .
So , with the growth of urbanization and with more and more of such complicated issues , ah , I think there will be increasingly high requirements on the systems .
That is , development of future systems is one of the top current priorities .
How can we institutionalize our response mechanisms and make them into a system so as to ensure the lifestyle of people who live in such a large - scale city ?
The State Council has proposed a public emergency contingency plan , called One Plan , Three Systems .
Uh-huh .
" One plan " refers to the contingency plan , and " three systems " refers to systems of organizations , mechanisms , and laws .
So , I think we still have a lot of work to do in these three areas of organizations , mechanisms , and laws .
Yes .
Well , finally , let 's turn our attention to handling of the situation , ah , during the latter stages of the cave - in accident in Beijing .
Traffic , ah , can be said to have been directed , and is basically under control now .
Well , following this , repairs have to be made on this road section where the accident occurred , including for many pipes .
Well , Yang Yang , based on your understanding , how long will it take ?
I think that the time really depends on how the overall repair goes .
This is because exploration , assessment , and repair are carried out in succession .
Therefore , regarding this work progress , to repair this road section in the shortest time , um , this will depend on the work progress .
Uh-huh .
This is because repair is probably not a matter of repairing the road surface alone .
There is also an issue with many of the pipes below .
Yes , the pipes below .
Right , as it is winter , we know that carrying out construction during winter , especially that which requires pouring concrete and then --
Moreover , it is especially difficult for concrete to set during winter .
Yes , preparation mix for making it dry faster , has already been added .
But in the end , it requires time .
Hence , it depends very much on factors like temperature .
Just now , you mentioned that there are many pipes , ah , for instance , there is a key heating pipeline .
The first thing is to ensure that it is connected in time .
Yes .
In addition , waste discharge is also very important .
Waste discharged has currently blocked this up .
Um , and , for instance , optical fibers , ah .
Er , right now , if the optical fibers break , people in many households will not be able to watch television .
Yes .
At present , we should not have a problem with watching television .
They are not broken .
It is just that , as the other pipes have to be repaired , the optical fibers have to be rearranged , to be hung up it seems .
After that , or it seems that a few steel pipes have been added below to make it safer to walk across this section .
Furthermore , let 's take water pipes as an example .
Because they were exposed , The water pipes were not --
after that , yes , these were not damaged .
they were not damaged and this is quite normal .
Um , there is no problem with water supply .
Okay , well , today both of you have come to the studio and given us a lot of specific details concerning this road cave - in accident in Beijing Municipality .
At the same time , you have also analyzed , from a system perspective , how the government has reinforced emergency contingency plans to handle such public emergency cases .
Okay , thank you very much , Professor Zhou and Yang Yang , for coming to the studio to participate in our program .
Thank you , both of you .
Okay , dear viewers , that is all for today 's edition of Focus Today .
Thank you for watching .
See you at the same time tomorrow .
Hello .
Let 's turn our attention to the weather .
Today , we can use two words to summarize the weather in our country .
First , there will be a temperature drop over a large area , and next , there will be rainfall and snowfall in an extensive area as well .
We see that except for some areas of South China , Southwest China , and Northeast China , many other places will be experiencing temperature drops .
In addition , there will be snowfall in the area from Northwest China to the Huang - Huai area through southern North China .
The east of Southwest China , as well as the Jiang - Huai area and the area south of the Yangtze River , will experience continuous rainfall .
However , southern North China and the Huang - Huai area will bid farewell to the snow tonight , ah .
Tomorrow during the day , snowfall in the Jiang - Huai area will stop , and there will also be less snow in Northwest China .
In addition , there will be rain throughout almost the whole of South China .
It can be said that there will be less snow in the north and heavier rain in the south tomorrow .

Children are left at home in the rural areas , after parents leave to work in the city .
These are called left - behind children .
The parents are also forced to work in the city .
In fact , they have no alternatives but to make such a decision .
There are 120 million farmers who work in the city all year round in China , thus creating nearly 20 million left - behind children .
I want to tell them that I miss them a lot .
Day after day and year after year , they long for love in loneliness and wait for family affection in defect .
I think that it is especially important to have emotional exchanges with the children .
Visit the children more often whenever possible .
-LSB- -RSB-
In September 2005 , a study report titled " Concern for Left - behind Children " had drawn wide public attention .
While the situation of peasant workers in the city has repeatedly put society into question , the phenomenon of left - behind children in rural areas has gradually entered the view of the public .
Ye Jingzhong is the assistant dean of the College of Humanities and Development at China Agricultural University , and team leader of the Left - behind Children Task Force .
In the last two years , he has led the task force to conduct many field interviews and investigations on left - behind children in numerous rural areas in central and western China , including Shaanxi , Ningxia , Hebei , and Beijing .
Why did you pick the central and western parts of China , and not the south , to conduct this study ?
First of all , for people who work in the city from the central and western regions um , uh , according to their educational level , they generally engage in strenuous manual labor when they leave for the city to work .
They are not in a position to bring their children to the city .
When we conducted this research study , our focus was to analyze the impact on children when their parents , work in the city .
, its main impact is the lack of love because of the absence of their parents .
Therefore , we believe that whether it 's in southern or northern part , no matter which part of the country the research is conducted in , the results should be consistent .
According to your estimation , how many left - behind children are there in China now ?
This group should be the biggest in number .
Um , the most conservative statistics for the group of people who leave the country to work in the city in our country is 100 million .
Nowadays , um , , um , many places , um , cite a figure of 120 million .
Many people quote a figure of 150 million .
Let 's think about it this way .
If we actually use 120 million as the statistic for the group who leave the country to work in the city , , at least half of them are um , married before they work in the city .
Of course , families of these married people will usually have children .
Moreover , they will usually have more than one child in rural areas .
So you can imagine .
I believe the left - behind children group is definitely more than 10 or 20 million .
It , uh , , in my opinion , should be around 50 million .
Of course , we have not conducted exact statistical calculations .
I believe the number of this group should be particularly large .
According to the study by the task force , at present , the four main types of custody for left - behind children include single - parent custody , skip - generation custody , relative custody , and same - generation custody . Among which , single - parent custody had the highest number , accounting for 79.2 percent of the people surveyed .
The next one was skip - generation custody , accounting for 16.9 percent . While those who lived with relatives or were entrusted to the care of someone else made up 4.1 percent and .9 percent of the total number of left - behind children , respectively .
According to your study , what do these left - behind children generally do with their daily life if their parents or parent work in the city ?
Different types of custody have different impacts on their life .
No doubt , , single - parent custody definitely creates less impact compared to the other types .
The impact of single - parent custody is smaller because at least the mother is at home .
There is no major problem in the children 's material life .
Of course , there are many impacts in other aspects , for instance , peer socialization .
The one that creates a huge impact is definitely skip - generation custody .
Skip - generation custody means the grandparents look after the children .
There is also relative or neighbor custody that asks neighbors or relatives to look after the children , and there is a type called self - custody .
These three types create the biggest and the most impact .
If we want to discuss this in more detail , let 's say , the skip - generation custody .
First , in skip - generation custody , their material life will no doubt be a lot less taken care of when compared to the usual both parents or one parent at home situation .
This is indisputable .
This type of family is not as good as the others .
We had an example of a child in Shaanxi province .
Um , there was a family !
This family had an older brother and a younger sister .
Both parents wanted to go to the city to work .
The father went first , and later the mother wanted to go , too .
What happened to these two children ?
The grandparents were unwilling to take care of them because in rural areas , grandparents also have to work in the field !
As a result , , this mother sent , these brother and sister , to martial arts school to study .
After they went to the martial arts school for a while , um , their mother was , um , a little worried , so she went to visit them .
She went to visit them .
When she saw them , , the girl cried to her and said , " I really do n't want to stay here .
I want to go home . "
Later , the mother was moved and brought , this girl home and had the grandparents look after her .
Um , she still , ai , left him at the martial arts school .
Um , um , after the girl returned , the mother continued to work in the city .
When she came back one time in between work , she found that the girl 's body was dotted with red marks and red swellings .
She then discovered ah , um , the grandparents had not washed her clothes for a very long time .
The situation you mentioned , is it common or is it a rather extreme example , because generally , people will think that grandparents will particularly love and care about their grandchildren ?
The situation that I just mentioned regarding skip - generation custody is no doubt common .
Why is it so ?
You said that grandparents certainly have special love for the children .
It is true .
It is true that they will go out of their way to pamper the children .
However , for the elderly , with the difference in age and time , , their , ways of taking care and loving the children are different .
They are influenced by their own habits .
For instance , there was a child who was sick .
Um , the grandparents asked him to take , a small pill that was made in Shaanxi .
They did not even know what it was made of .
It was a local method .
Um , after all , they are different from , um , young people in this respect .
Instead of sending the child to the hospital as quickly as possible , they are influenced by , some habits in this aspect .
, they raised this point themselves .
Another important point they mentioned was that they had to take care of the entire family .
" Her father and mother are not home , so the entire family falls onto our shoulders , especially when we still have to be responsible for the farm work on the farmland .
So , all I can do is to feed her and make sure that she is not cold . "
They also had to face such a reality , one that they could not resolve .
After all , a family that had so many people in the beginning , , the parents of the children were a very important um , workforce .
Now it was down to the two grandparents .
No doubt , they could not help .
In the study of left - behind children , many staff found out by surprise that the biological cycle of the farmers who work in the city , and the inculcation and upbringing cycle of their children , have formed two parallel lines that will never meet .
Farmers who work in the city are generally a young workforce in their prime , while this is the period in which their children attend primary or junior high school .
Originally , they work in the city out of the hope that their children can receive a better education .
However , adolescent children need the loving care and guidance of their parents even more .
During this period , the absence of both or even one parent will create obstacles to the character development of the children .
This pair of unavoidable contradictions has made the problem of left - behind children in rural areas become more obvious .
You have seen many kinds of left - behind children .
Was there a particular case or a particular child who had left an especially deep impression on you that you still remember now ?
, um , there was a child in Ningxia whose name was Yao Zhengang .
This child , um , did not do exceptionally well in school .
What impressed me the most about him was that he really missed his parents .
He felt particularly lonely and especially wanted his father to come back .
He said that he was sick one time .
His father worked in Guyuan , about 40 to 50 kilometers away from home .
After his father learned that he was very sick , he ran back to the village right away .
After he arrived at the village , he did not say anything , but to put him on his back and carry him to the town to see a doctor .
He just carried him like that without saying a word .
When the doctor in the town took a look and told him that they were unable to cure the sickness , he carried the child to the county .
When Yao Zhengang told us what happened , he said , " My father had never bought me so many tasty foods before .
On that day , he bought me a lot of tasty food while we were in the county , but he did not eat any himself . "
I thought about this at that time .
After I heard this incident , I particularly understood what was in the mind of Yao Zhengang 's father .
He might have felt especially guilty toward his child .
What he felt was that " I go out to work and leave my child home . "
He said that his child had also said , " When he was at home , he always encouraged me . "
He would say , " No problem . You work hard and get a better grade next time , " when I had low grades .
If he could receive many , such encouragements , he would not have um , um , disliked school sometimes .
He does not want to go to school now .
However , in his example , I could imagine what went through his father 's mind at that time .
I think that he felt very guilty toward his child .
Therefore , I can feel that um , um , parents who work in the city also have no alternative .
They are forced into making such decisions .
Um , there was also this child .
There was a child , a girl in Xixiang county , Shaanxi province .
Um , when I asked , " What do you think are the changes that your parents working in the city have caused you ? " She did not answer .
She went home to get a small box .
There was a small finger inside the box .
This was a very terrifying incident .
What was the small finger all about ?
What happened was that when her um , parents left to work in the city , her grandparents looked after her .
They had a cellar at home and inside was a hay cutter for cutting hay .
When she went downstairs to play by herself , an accident happened .
Her grandparents said , " We ca n't help .
We ca n't keep an eye on her all the time . "
, before they went to work in the city , they could watch her and forbade her to go down to the cellar .
He had told her not to do that before .
However , I said that sometimes it is very difficult to ask children to have self control .
That was why she turned this way .

This is Ruangang village , Bocang town , Yi county , Hebei province .
Among the 303 households in the village , one - third of the families have people who work in the city .
More than half of the children in the village are left - behind children .
Most of the children 's parents are in the southern part of the country .
Many people want to save some travel expenses and earn some more money , so it is very common for them not to return home for a year or two .
Life is so vast .
Life is an ocean wherever life exists .
It has been six years since 14 - year - old Jiang Beiwen was sent by his parents to live with his maternal grandfather in Ruangang village .
His parents rely on selling rice in Guangzhou to support their child 's education .
They live a very hard life .
Little Beiwen has not seen them once in the past six years .
Oh , I see so many children here who can turn for comfort in their parents ' arms !
Ah , I envy them .
So , I also , want to be able to turn to comfort in my parents ' arms .
I was at school the time I missed my mother the most .
Uh huh .
We had a market !
Oh , every day , there were parents who bought things for their oh , sons and daughters .
I also wish that my parents could buy me things .
I envied them very much .
That was when I missed my mother the most .
This is Jiang Beiwen 's favorite photo .
It was taken with his father six years ago , before he sent him to live with his maternal grandfather .
He was only eight years old at that time .
The only connection that little Beiwen has with his parents now is to talk on the phone with them once a week .
In his opinion , affection among family members is something unreachable .
How often can your mother call you ?
Uh , once a week !
What do you talk about ?
I will talk about my studies and life .
My schoolwork was not quite good when I first came !
My mother scolded me in the beginning when my schoolwork was poor .
She said that I was losing honor for not doing well at school !
Then I cried and after that , my mother cried , too .
Since they move from place to place in the city to work all year round , parents of left - behind children have little communication with their children .
While for temporary custodians , they are only limited to providing superficial care , such as making sure the children have food and stay warm , but can not fulfill the responsibility of educating the children .
The survey found that 36.7 percent of the children had never been to their parents ' workplace .
8.2 percent of the parents almost never contacted their children .
21.4 percent of the parents contacted their children less than once a month .
Since their parents are absent , how can these children communicate and exchange with their parents ?
Our study found that um , um , the principal means of contact between the left - behind children and their parents was through the telephone .
However , contrary to our belief that they could talk on the phone for a long time when they called , approximately 50 percent of the left - behind children we surveyed talked on the phone with their parents for three minutes or so .
What could they talk about in three minutes ?
I think it is hard to say anything meaningful in three minutes .
Of course , we also studied what these children talked to their parents about in these three - minute telephone conversations .
What did the parents who worked in the city talk about with their children ?
What touched us very deeply was that 70 percent of the content of the children 's conversations with their parents was to ask about their safety and not other things , such as how much they had earned .
As for the content of the parents ' conversations with their children , first , it was school .
Whether they were good and how their schoolwork was .
Second , it was whether they obeyed their custodians and what they ate and things like that .
Uh , as for safety matters , in fact , they could not have any emotional exchange .
We know that sometimes when we talk on the phone , even a pause is a need for emotional exchange .
However , the parents may not have realized this .
For instance , the child has stopped talking .
He stops talking because he needs to pause to consider how to say what is in his mind .
The parents may not have realized this point , so they hang up the phone immediately .
Of course , for three minutes , why was it only for three minutes ?
In many cases , it was because they worried about the charge .
, many left - behind children told us that they especially wanted to call their parents on the phone .
However , um , they considered that um , one thing , sometimes they did not have a telephone at home .
It was very difficult for children to borrow the phone from their neighbors .
Second , um , they considered that they needed money to make a phone call .
Some children told me , " I secretly called my parents when my custodians were not home . "
The children have a great need for this type of telephone exchange .
Do the left - behind children understand why their parents work in the city ?
Um , um , we conducted a survey on this question .
We were very surprised to find that 40 percent of the left - behind children had no idea what jobs their parents held away from home .
How could that be possible ?
How could that be possible ?
We interviewed some left - behind children , their custodians , and the people who work in the city .
Why would n't the children know what they did ?
First , we can tell from the content of the three - minute telephone conversations we mentioned earlier that children are particularly concerned about the safety of the parents who work in the city .
However , a lot of the work that the parents engaged in is dangerous work , including coalmines , construction , and some others , many of them are dangerous jobs .
Thus , I believe the parents of these left - behind children also choose not to take the initiative and tell them the nature of their job .
Why do they do that ?
It is because they are afraid that their children will worry .
Second , , parents , especially fathers , who work in the city have a particularly lofty image in the children 's mind .
Maybe they do not want their children to know about the nature of their job or tell them what they do .
They , do not want to destroy the lofty image of themselves in the child 's mind .
At noon , the maternal grandmother and maternal grandfather went to work in the field and did not come home .
Jiang Beiwen has to make lunch for himself .
This happens to him very often .
He could look after himself since he was nine .
What work are you going to do today , other than cooking ?
Uh , I will do the dishes after I finish eating .
If it is Sunday when I am free , I will , also do some farm work .
What kind of work ?
Uh , I will hoe the field , uh , when we are in a hurry to till the land for growing crops , I will help do some work .
Do you still remember your mother 's cooking ?
Uh huh , I do .
It was especially tasty .
Now , the most I want to know is , my parents ' health .
Why do you want to know about that ?
It is because I care about my parents very much .
I think about their work because I know that they work in the city because of me , so I care about them a lot .
They will be worn out from working in the city , working in the city to make money .
I believe it is also because of me , so I care about their health a lot .
Because of you , why is it because of you ?
Because if they did n't have me , I think they uh , would be a lot more , relaxed when they worked .
Then , are these children willing to live with their parents ? Or go to the city with them ?
In regard to this , first , , children all want their parents to come back to live with them .
However , 51 percent of the children we surveyed were unwilling to go to the city with their parents , go to the city , to live in the city .
However , they all wanted their parents to come back , but half of the children did not want to go to the city .
We also asked them why they did not want to go to the city .
This was also very surprising to us .
They said that the city is another world and they were especially worried .
They were afraid that once they go to the city , they will not be able to assimilate into the schools and things like that .
Second , they realized that it is already a very difficult task for their parents to work in the city .
Their parents have to send money home , among other things .
If they go live with them , they will add more burdens to their parents .
If we are in the city every day , live in the city every day , we may know that oh , city life is like this .
As for children from rural areas and people from rural areas who work in the city , they are not familiar with this world and they have a type of fear .
As for parents , are they more willing to bring their children with them or leave them at home ?
I believe when parents make this decision , their main consideration is not willing or unwilling .
All parents , I can say the majority of the parents , definitely want to live with their children .
However , with the reality that they have to face , I believe that they can not solve this problem .
Of course , we know what the reality is .
First , their families are rather poor to begin with .
Only the lower - middle class will leave the rural areas and work in the city .
They have to make money to support the family .
They will need a huge sum of money in order to bring their children to the city .
Nonetheless , I believe there are also many other reasons .
They also have to consider whether their children can go to school in the city .
They have to find a place to live .
All these are problems that they need to resolve .
The problems they face are too many .
If the children go to the city , the expenses will be very high .
Since circumstances do not permit , they can not bring their children with them , according to their will or their psychological need .
Many parents are unable to bring their children with them .
What would you tell your parents if you could see them now ?
I want to tell them that I miss them very much .
Judging from the surface , is there any obvious difference between the character of these left - behind children and non-left - behind children ?
It is hard to tell from the surface .
Why is it so ?
For these children , it depends on how long their parents have been working in the city .
For example , some have just gone for a year , while others have gone for 10 years already .
In this case , um , generally speaking , uh , we did not conduct any psychological testing or comparison in this psychological aspect .
However , many schools and custodians reported that many left - behind children had become very withdrawn .
They had very strange um , um , temperaments .
They did not like to speak .
There was , a child who was in the first year of junior high school .
Um , um , he told us himself that he particularly , um , um , misses his father .
He was very good at school .
However , one time we visited him , his um , family told us that he was second in his class in his examination .
After that , he became extremely , extremely , annoyed .
Um , um , um , his language and other things became very strange .
Um , um , we also asked his um , um , grandparents who had custody of him .
They said that when his father was home , he would always encourage him and um , exchange with him .
Um , of course , it was not necessarily because his parents worked in the city .
However , for some left - behind children , their parents working in the city has caused some psychological abnormalities and unusual development .
This situation indeed exists .
After all , these are families whose love is inadequate and incomplete .
I believe love is especially important .
Children need love from the time they are small .
We have to understand our Chinese saying , " The child is father to the man . "
What it says is that the character that children form at a very young age will affect their entire life .
Only children who are loved and who realize the importance of love since they are young will be able to love other people in the future .
This is the case .
Therefore , for this type , um , um , um , this group of left - behind children , psychologically , they do not have family love .
Um , , if the parents work in the city , these children perhaps will not receive timely attention when they encounter many difficulties at home .
Perhaps the neighbors around are all facing different realities and can not offer them timely love .
Under this situation , I believe , I am not sure , um , I am unwilling to imagine what mentality and character these children will develop when they grow up .
Will they believe there is love in society or not ?
Will they think that love is important in society or not , because they have never experienced it .
They have never completely experienced it .
Thus , if such a large group in society does not realize that love should be , um , given or received in society , I think this is , something that I do not want to imagine .
Despite the guarantee in food , clothing , and school that left - behind children get because their parents work in the city to make money , they do not have the psychological and physiological satisfaction that they require .
According to the survey , more than half of the left - behind children were dissatisfied with their current life .
58 percent of the left - behind children believed that they were unhappy .
Are the parents worried about leaving their children at home by themselves ?
Do they understand the living conditions of their children at home ?
They thought that this was a reality that they could not um , um , face .
They were condemned to this reality .
No doubt , I think some , um , parents have not had such profound consideration .
Why do n't they ?
I believe people are all the same .
If they face such an urgent need for a livelihood , their first consideration will be the need for a livelihood .
They can not consider the deeper issue of children 's safety and psychology when their livelihood has not been solved , satisfied , and guaranteed .
For example , there were two sisters who lived in a cave dwelling in Shaanxi province .
Many people whom we interviewed lived in cave dwellings .
Once there was a flood .
, these sisters stayed in the cave dwelling to look after the home !
This happened in the rural area .
These two children were looking after the home .
Their uncle saved them when the flood was almost past their bellies .
Their father called later to see if they were fine .
The family told him that they were fine .
He did not come back after that .
He did not come back to check if everything was fine .
I believe the reason he did not return was that he would ponder whether he should return or not .

Why did n't television slam on the brakes /?
Welcome to Reliable Sources /.
I 'm Howard Kurtz /.
You 're joining us at our new time ten AM eastern seven pacific for a full hour of media analysis every week /.
We have some new segments we 'll be adding in the coming week /.
so stay tuned /.
I had a wide ranging sitdown with Pulitzer Prize winner Tom Friedman /.
but first Judy Miller and the New York Times finally go public on the front page this morning with their nearly six thousand word account of the CIA leak investigation /.
In a separate first person account Miller confirmed that she told the grand jury that Scooter Libby Dick Cheney 's top aide discussed with her as many as three times the role of Valerie Plame as a CIA employee /.
This says the Bush administration was angry about her husband Joe Wilson 's role in criticizing President Bush on whether Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction /.
The conclusion by a team of Times reporters /.
The Times incurred millions of dollars in legal fees in Miss Miller 's case /.
It limited its own ability to cover aspects of one of the biggest scandals of the day /.
Even as the paper asked for the public 's support it was unable to answer its questions /.
Among the journalistic revelations, Miller released from jail last month says she pushed for a story on the outing of Valerie Plame back in two thousand three /.
She never wrote one /.
but her former boss says no way /.
that never happened /.
And the Times was so conflicted in covering the controversy the editors killed the story about Libby and pulled their punches in other ways /.
And joining us now in Los Angeles Arianna Huffington the syndicated columnist and founder of the blog huffington post dot com /.
in Minneapolis Lucy Dalglish executive director of the Reporters ' Committee for Freedom of the Press /.
and here in Washington Frank Sesno professor of public policy and communication at George Mason University and a CNN special correspondant /.
Frank Sesno has the New York Times belatedly to be sure fought and finally made an honest accounting of its role of Judy Miller 's role and the tensions that she created in the newsroom /?
Well an honest accounting /.
yeah maybe /.
but not a full accounting /.
You know and if the whole bottom line of this mess is that the public has the right to know and that that 's what this is all about the public still does n't know a lot of things /.
There 's still a lot of questions here /.
Why was that waiver that Miller was apparently granted by uh Scooter Libby a year ago /-
Why did it wait until she sat in jail for all that time before she actually took up on it /?
you know she 's referred to in the Times ' own account as Miss Run Amuck /.
She was pulled off of certain stories on Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction /.
What are her motives and bottom lines to the secrecy of this whole thing /?
There 's a lot we still do n't know /.
Miss Run Amuck was a name she gave herself quite proudly apparently /.
Arianna Huffington the Times piece a lengthy piece acknowledges that Judy Miller was a controversial figure in the newsroom whose own WMD reporting was wrong and that while she claims to have pushed for this uh story on Valerie Plame two years ago Jill Abrahamson now the paper 's managing editor says No way /.
That did n't happen /.
In other words there 's a dispute in the accounts /.
Pretty candid stuff for a newspaper to publish about itself would n't you say /?
Well as Frank said there are many unanswered questions /.
And there are many very devastating eh comments and conclusions about Judy Miller as a journalist /.
I do n't think the Times had any choice though Howie . Because remember as a press reporter back on July twenty - seventh the turmoil in the newsroom has been going on for months about Judy Miller and the way the paper has decided to cover the story and the way they decided to present her as a martyr for the first amendment /.
And the main unanswered question here is why did Arthur Sulzberger the newspaper 's publisher allow Judy Miller to hijack the reporting of that story and the editorial policy on that story /.
And the similarities for the Jayson Blair case /.
Remember after the Jayson Blair scandal broke we had a seven thousand word story that did not give a full account of what happened . Especially about why is a major institution like the Times ignoring so many red flags /.
Alright /.
In the story one of things that we learn is that Bill Keller took Judy Miller off her WMD beat as one of his first personnel decisions when he took eh the reins as editor /.
Alright /.
Well uh I agree there are some unanswered questions /.
but I 'm willing to give the Times a little more credit than you for at least attempting to answer uh many of the questions /.
And Lucy Dalglish here 's the thing that jumped out at me in the story /.
Judy Miller acknowledges that at Louis Libby 's request this is the Dick Cheney aide she agreed to refer to him and in stories not as a senior administration official but as a former Hill aide because he had once worked on Capitol Hill /.
Do you have a problem with that sort of thing /?
I thought that was a little bit misleading /.
And I thought it was odd /.
I mean her justification was that well he had been a former Hill staffer /.
Um but that was a strange request /.
and I think the agreement was strange /.
I 'll agree with you on that /.
Frank Sesno the Times was so hamstrung by its passionate embrace of this reporter who after all was facing jail did go to jail /.
One can understand the emotions uh that were unleashed here /.
and yet the editors discouraged stories on the CIA leak investigation and one time killed a piece written by a reporter about Scooter Libby /.
Was that an abdication of journalistic responsibility /?
Maybe yeah maybe /.
I mean what it really shows Howie I think is just how difficult it is for news organizations to report on themselves /.
You know news organizations demand total transparency whether you 're General Motors or United States government /.
We want access /.
We want explanation /.
We want full disclosure /.
But it 's very difficult for them to do it themselves /.
In this case and the Times makes it very plain in their story today they really suffered /.
They were behind on virtually every major aspect of the story /.
Even when she went to jail /?
Even when she went to jail and w- /.
When she won release from jail /.
Yeah at the point that she came out /.
They did n't say that you know until she walked out /.
And the question and this is a very serious question it 's not answered in the article /.
Were editorial higher - ups and were the corporate lawyers at the New York Times in some way leaning on suppressing and distorting the coverage from the news uh section /?
Arianna Huffington uh in this lengthy piece this morning uh uh Judy Miller is quoted excuse me as saying that there was another source beside Scooter Libby that she dealt with on the Valerie Plame situation /.
She does n't recall who that source was looking at her notes and seeing the uh notation Valerie Flame /.
She got the name wrong /.
Do you buy this notion that she does n't recall who this other source was /?
No of course not Howie /.
In fact I think this is the major unanswered question /.
We do n't know who eh her source was when it comes to revealing the identity of Valerie Plame /.
And to say that she does not recall is really as convincing as having Woodward and Bernstein saying that they do not recall who Deep Throat was /.
After all these notes were just a few weeks old when um the Valerie Plame Bob Novak column appeared and when the whole Washington and the whole journalistic community was talking about it /.
You know I do n't /-
Incidentally there was some questions uh that Judy Miller would not answer to her colleagues /.
and she would n't share her notes with them although they 've been turned over to the special prosecutor /.
Lucy Dalglish the big news for me was Miller recounting what her lawyer Floyd Abrams had said to her about a conversation that he had with Joe Tate who was Scooter Libby 's lawyer /.
Uh says um Floyd Abrams according to Miller 's account when I would n't give him Tate an assurance that you would exonerate Libby he said do n't go there /.
Now Tate by the way tells the Times that that account is false and outrageous /.
Does this help justify eh Judy Miller 's otherwise mysterious decision to go to jail and not accept the waiver of confidentiality that Scooter Libby offered and sit in jail for eighty - five days /?
N- you n- /.
you know I 've been talking to Judy off and on about this case for the last year /.
This was a very difficult decision /.
and you know what this all comes down to is you keep your promises when you make a promise to a confidential source /.
You 'll recall six or eight months ago Howie I was on the show and we were talking about you know did Russert and Kessler and all the rest of those guys did they break some trust by agreeing to testify and observing the waiver /?
What I think this situation and the turmoil that is obviously going on at the Times right now points out is the fact that we have a major problem in this country /.
it 's that reporters believe they need to keep their promises to their sources /.
Reporters will try to do whatever they can as long as the law allows them to protect those sources /.
Right /.
But these days um with the state of our law the fact that we do not have a federal shield law we have prosecutors and civil litigants going in there and interfering with the day to day operation of our newsrooms /.
and we just can tolerate this /.
And we 're trying to /-
I think Lucy 's on to something here if I can just say Howie /.
And I think this is very important because this is an ugly case /.
And even people close to Judith Miller say this is not the one you 'd really like to go to the mat on /.
You 'd love to have a clear whistle blower case /.
You 'd love to have a Pentagon papers case /.
You 'd love to have something where the well - being and the sanctity of the Republic you know hangs in the balance /.
She did n't even report on this /.
But it does point out a very serious issue /.
And that is the whole notion of the use of and abuse of confidential sources the protections that reporters do or do n't have and the propensity of uh the United States government to have more secrecy not less /.
We 've got to figure this out /.
Well just to clarify uh she did ultimately uh testify about her confidential source /.
The whole issue was how voluntary was the waiver of her promise to Scooter Libby offered and why was she able to accept after being in jail as opposed to before being in jail /.
Well exactly /.
and you know what Howie /. /.
it 's really time for Lucy and other Judy Miller defenders to update her talking points because what Lucy just said just simply does not wash /.
The truth is that as Howie said she did testify /.
The truth is that it 's very clear from the stories today that she could 've asked uh Scooter Libby to call her so that she could hear the timber of his voice earlier /.
All of that could have happened /.
It did not happen because clearly Judy Miller is protecting another source that she still has not revealed to the American public /.
And the New York Times is /.
Lucy /.
/.
Let me get a response from Lucy Dalglish /.
I think it 's very obvious from what Judy wrote today she is protecting somebody else /.
And one of the reasons that this negotiation took so long is that not only was she negotiating what she was going to say about Scooter Libby but you got to keep in mind I 'm a lawyer there were lawyers involved in this /.
They had to negotiate with Patrick Fitzgerald what he would not talk about /.
They also had to negotiate whether or not there would be any type of um uh uh obstruction charges connected with contacting /.
Once you invoke the wrath or the extreme interest of a federal prosecutor you have to be very very careful /.
You do n't mess with the Feds /.
It 's very clear in her story that she decided finally to testify because she got tired of jail because she was threatened with criminal contempt charges because she wanted to go out and now she 's saying admitting finally write a book /.
All these things are there in black and white /.
and to continue to portray her as a martyr is not going to work /.
And on that point Arianna on that point she says sh- /-
Excuse me /.
Judy Miller says she 's taking some time off from the paper /.
She wants to write a book /.
She would n't share her notes with her colleagues who were writing the story /.
Do you think she 'll ever come back /?
You think she 's saving it for the book /?
Well it 's very clear that she would not be welcome in the newsroom /.
And it 's very clear eh as I reported again that when Bill Keller took her off her WMD beat they were all hoping she would resign /.
Instead she threw a fit /.
but she stayed on /.
This is not a journalism one oh one course the way she handled both the WMD reporting and Plame Gate /.
Frank Sesno please comment /.
Jump in /.
And Howie I 'll tell you what /.
This is a gigantic shot across the bow of every manager in the news business and every editor and every executive producer anywhere because you got to have some uh control some connection with your correspondants and your reporters /.
You got to know who they 're talking to at some level anyway because you know what /?
It 's about trust with the public /.
and it 's about you know ending up in jail or in court /.
their story says that Bill Keller and Arthur Sulzberger did not press Judy Miller about her conversations with Libby or ask to see her notes while they were defending her /.
Ask to see her /.
And by the way we invited the New York Times to have an editor appear on this program /.
The paper declined /.
When we come back media speculation run amuck over possible indictments at sixteen hundred Pennsylvania and the President 's scripted session with troops in Iraq /.
Stay with us /.
Welcome back to Reliable Sources /.
As the CIA leak investigation continued this week media folks did plenty of speculating with no evidence about the possible indictment of a certain top White House official who testified before the grand jury for the fourth time on Friday /.
Karl Rove his closest aide the number two man in the White House the man that has been called Bush 's brain /.
If he 's indicted and has to go it undermines the key source of this President 's public support his character /.
If Rove gets indicted that could bring down the Bush administration I think /.
My understanding from talking to somebody quite close to this investigation is that they think there are going to be indictments /.
and possibly Karl Rove could be among them /.
Lucy Dalglish if Karl Rove is indicted , if Karl Rove is indicted , what if he 's not indicted /?
Is n't this the worst kind of journalistic speculation /?
Yeah /.
You know I think it 's always dangerous to speculate whether or not you 're really besmirching someone 's reputation . Although I 'm not sure you can do that with Karl Rove /.
But it uh is very very you know eh irre- /-
I would prefer that people keep an eye on you know watching him testify and going in and out of the courthouse /.
But uh will it bring down the administration /?
I do n't know /.
Ah eh I do n't know /.
Well nobody knows /.
That 's the point /.
Arianna Huffington I used to cover the justice department /.
Not everybody who 's under investigation winds up getting indicted /.
Ah but you certainly and you 're uh on a blog so maybe it 's a different standard have speculated about Rove 's fate as well /.
Well not just Rove though /.
what we have speculated is that it might be a much more tangled web that Fitzgerald is after the whole Iraq White House group the group that uh in Cheney 's office with Libby and Rove and Mary Matalin and Condoleezza Rice and a lot of administration officials basically sold um a war to the American public based on lies /.
I mean that is really the web /.
But it seems and we find out today also from uh um the reporting on the Miller story , that uh Fitzgerald is after Cheney even in some of the questioning eh of Miller /.
I think those were fairly routine questions about /.
you have Judy Miller there /.
you ask about Cheney /. /.
He was being thorough /.
I think we 're overthinking this whole thing /.
Karl Rove and this speculation business you know /.
Frank Sesno /.
Pat Fitzgerald /.
It 's very easy to sit here and say oh we should never speculate in journalism /.
It 's irresponsible journalism /.
It 's really how you speculate not that you speculate /.
The fact of the matter is that Karl Rove has been to the grand jury four times /.
The fact of the matter is that there are lots of people in Washington and believe me they 're not all journalists who are speculating what if the guy gets indicted /.
It would be irresponsible I think for the media not to reflect what the discussion is here in town /.
And there are plenty of Republicans mostly Republicans who are worried about this /.
Alright I want to turn now to uh President Bush 's uh meeting uh uh photo op some called it with US troops in Iraq whether it was staged how shocking that would be /.
Let 's take a look at the actual footage /.
And in your interactions with the Iraqi civilians in Tikrit Saddam 's hometown how are they reacting to this political process /?
Sir in the north central area of Iraq voter registration has increased seventeen percent /.
Can you give us a sense for the reception of the people there in Tikrit /?
Sir in north central Iraq voter regis- /-
Are you stunned /?
Are you stunned /?
Shocked /.
I ca n't believe it /.
they rehearsed it /.
They rehearsed it /.
They rehearsed it /.
Yeah you know something /?
uh I remember a long time ago Michael Deaver the ultimate image meister for Ronald Reagan said my job is to light the President well and for everything I do to put the President in a good light /.
Now look first of all this is uncomfortable to see /.
and what the problem this now creates for the White House is {is} it plays into the credibility issue that the President has that everything now is becoming a photo op and a rehearsed event in order to rescue what are tumbling numbers on his performance on public support of Iraq the whole bit /.
But the fact that anybody would think that you would do something like this a remote /.
I mean anybody in television will tell you that 's complicated business /.
You have satellite delay /.
You have a half a dozen people sitting there /.
Who 's going to speak when /.
You do n't want awkward silences /.
You 're going to walk through it /.
so that it happened does n't surprise me /.
That it hurts the President yeah that 's inevitable too /.
Arianna Huffington does the staging here surprise you at all /?
Well it 's not the question of surpising me Howie /.
It 's the fact that we are talking about war /.
This is not just any photo opportunity /.
Of course that 's part and parcel of the presidency /.
But we 're talking about a war in which almost two thousand young Americans have died /.
And we are also using soldiers as props /.
Yes it is shocking /.
and I think Keith Olbermann did a phenomenal job at exposing this on MSNBC /.
Alright /.
And I think more and more journalists are actually taking a hard look at what this administration is doing /.
And we 'll have to leave it there /.
Last word /.
Arianna Huffington Lucy Dalglish in Minneapolis Frank Sesno thanks so very much for joining us /.
Coming up , we launch our new segment Talk Back to the Media /.
President Clinton 's former lawyer Lanny Davis takes on Sixty Minutes and ex-FBI director Louis Freeh /.
And still to come New York Times columnist Tom Friedman /.
Welcome back /.
In our new Talk Back to the Media segment someone who believes he or she 's been treated unfairly by the press gets the chance to sound off and give their side of the controversy /.
Last Sunday Mike Wallace sat down with Louis Freeh who 's peddling a memoir on Sixty Minutes /.
and the former FBI director unloaded on the President who appointed him Bill Clinton /.
Among his criticisms the former president 's handling of the nineteen ninety - six Khobar Towers terrorist bombing that killed nineteen US marines in Saudi Arabia /.
I was very disappointed that the political leadership of the United States uh would tell the families of these nineteen heroes that we were going to leave no stone unturned and find the people who killed them /.
to give that order to the director because that 's the order that I got and then to do nothing to assist and facilitate that investigation in fact to undermine it /.
The Clinton people were furious at the way Sixty Minutes hailed the segment /.
and here to talk back is former Clinton White House attorney Lanny Davis /.
Welcome /.
Let 's deal with the substance first /.
Louis Freeh says that when Clinton met with Crown Prince Abdullah in nineteen ninety - eight , he did n't press for FBI access to suspects in the Khobar Towers bombing and he hit up the prince for a contribution to his presidential library /.
Well not only is that false and President Clinton has said so but everybody who attended the meeting not including Louis Freeh says it 's false /.
And my problem with Sixty Minutes is that they never called anybody at the meeting /.
Until Friday afternoon we did n't even know the charge was being made /.
And even then they were unwilling to put somebody on the air to contradict Mister Freeh /.
Sixty Minutes says Bill Clinton was offered a chance to come on and give his rebuttal /.
What 's wrong with that /?
Well first of all it 's absolutely amazing that Sixty Minutes thinks it 's okay to air a false and malicious statement /.
This is a terrible charge that an FBI investigation was thwarted because President Clinton wanted to receive money for his library /.
The charge was false /.
and the only way that that can be countered is a former president of the United States /?
What about anybody at the meeting who was willing to be on /?
What about them doing reporting themselves before they air a false and demonstrably false charge /?
That 's my problem /.
What about Sandy Berger the former national security advisor under President Clinton /?
He was at the meeting /.
He was in the room /.
Did you offer him for an on - camera interview /?
Well on Friday afternoon /.
You were n't there /.
I was not there /.
You 're good on television /.
but you were n't there /.
uh I talked to Sandy Berger /.
We issued a statement from Mister Berger /.
but this was Friday afternoon when we first learned about it with Sunday broadcast /.
Why did n't Sixty Minutes invite Mister Berger or other people at the meeting before Friday afternoon /?
Why did it take us to get Sixty Minutes to do basic reporting to verify facts /?
It 's not enough to have Louis Freeh say something is so based on an anonymous source /.
That 's poor journalism /.
On that point let me read a statement from a Sixty Minutes spokesman /.
And this involves uh their saying that they contacted Clinton 's office back in August with a detailed list of charges and then quote in subsequent phone calls the President 's people said he did not want to be interviewed /.
They gave no +substantive response to any of the allegations until Lanny Davis launched his PR campaign on the Thursday before the broadcast and offered himself as the person from the camp who would merely disparage and attack Freeh rather than deal with his allegations /.
Denials from President Clinton and Sandy Berger that did deal with Freeh 's allegations were included in the Sixty Minutes report /.
Well first of all it 's false to say that I was asking to disparage Freeh /.
I was asking to talk about facts that Freeh was saying that were not true /.
You do n't mind disparaging Freeh /.
my observation /.
no in fact I disparage any man who as FBI director has a personal pique rather than doing his job /.
That 's disparaging /.
Secondly it is absolutely a misrepresentation that they told us before just the week before /.
When Mister Carson the representative spoke to Mister Wallace Mister Wallace agreed that they had never verified what Mister uh Freeh had said /.
They never talked to Mister Freeh /.
and in fact it was n't until that Friday that we learned the substance of Mister Freeh 's charges /.
So Sixty Minutes I think has just said something that is false /.
When did the Clinton team find out that Sixty Minutes was going to report that Louis Freeh with his new book was going to have a specific allegation about Clinton 's handling of the Khobar Towers investigation and the business about the presidential library solicitation /.
When somebody named Howard Kurtz wrote a story in the Washington Post on Friday morning is the first time that the Clinton forces learned about that false and demonstrably false charge that good reporting by calling people who were at the meeting could have done would have verified that Mister Freeh made a false charge /.
And even since that interview Mister Freeh has backed off and has not told people who his source is /.
and he has n't even insisted that it was true /.
He just said somebody told him it was true /.
Hold on /.
Sixty Minutes spokesman Kevin Tedesco said in the statement I just referred to that the Clinton office was contacted in August with a detailed list of charges /.
That 's false /.
Are you saying that 's false /?
They were never told /. /.
or at least I 'm now basing this on what Mister Carson has told me /.
Jay Carson is the spokesman for former president Bill Clinton /.
Jay Carson is the spokesperson for President Clinton was not informed about the specific charge about the Khobar Towers which happens to be not true /.
President Clinton at that uh meeting did press the uh Crown Prince to cooperate with the FBI /.
so what Mister Freeh said was false /.
That was not understood by the Clinton people until it was read in the Washington Post in the story that you wrote because Sixty Minutes put a press release out /.
Uh now look Lanny Davis Sixty Minutes gave Bill Clinton one hour last year to push his own ten million dollar autobiography /.
He criticized people /.
He criticized Ken Starr /.
They did n't have Ken Starr on to rebut /.
Now the former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation uh who ca n't stand Clinton clearly writes a book gets one segment for his book /.
and you cry foul /.
Nobody was complaining about when Bill Clinton was getting all this airtime on CBS /.
Look /.
Look this is a program about good journalism /.
Let 's ask a Sixty Minutes uh journalist to say do you have an obligation to verify a charge made by the former FBI director as whether it 's true or not /.
Is it good enough to air it just because he says it /.
or should you do reporting /?
Good reporters would hear that charge and say that is an extremely serious charge to be levelled against former president Clinton /.
Let 's see whether it 's true and start making phone calls /.
They did not do that /.
That 's a fact /.
Alright Lanny Davis thanks very much for coming on to Talk Back to the Media this morning /.
We appreciate it /.
Ahead in the second half of Reliable Sources New York Times columnist Tom Friedman on whether the media are suffering from Iraq fatigue /.
Plus that heavily hyped subway threat that was n't /.
After an update on the hour 's top stories from Atlanta /.
Hello I 'm at the CNN center in Atlanta /.
Now in the news /.
Earthquake relief flights have resumed in Pakistan /.
That 's after torrential rain stopped flights for hours there /.
And a Pakistani helicopter crashed killing six soldiers /.
A magnitude seven point six earthquake struck last weekend as you recall /.
Pakistan 's prime minister says it killed at least thirty - eight thousand people and left about two and a half million homeless /.
Toledo Ohio is quiet this morning after a planned march by a self - styled nazi group sparked a riot yesterday /.
The Associated Press says police arrested at least sixty - five people /.
The march never got started /.
but hundreds of counter-demonstrators showed up and battled police on and off for more than three hours /.
Police say the protestors vandalized vehicles and buildings setting at least one structure on fire /.
Look at this /.
a semi-truck and a bus carrying high school band members collided overnight on interstate ninety - four and in Wisconsin /.
The Associated Press quotes the Wisconsin state patrol as saying at least five people were killed /.
The students were from Chippewa Falls Wisconsin /.
They were returning from a band competition at the University of Wisconsin in Whitewater /.
Those are the headlines this morning /.
I 'm in Atlanta /.
We have another news update coming up in just thirty minutes /.
More of CNN 's Reliable Sources continues right now /.
Welcome back to the second half of Reliable Sources /.
Our new time for those of you just turning in is ten AM eastern seven on the west coast /.
And we 'll be bringing you a full hour of media interviews and analysis each week /.
The Iraq story which the media has placed on the back burner in recent months is simmering again as voters in that war torn country went to the polls yesterday to vote on a new constitution with the results yet to be counted /.
But are journalists getting the real story there /?
To help us scrutinize the coverage I sat down with a foreign affairs columnist of the New York Times three time Pulitzer winner Tom Friedman and the author most recently of The World is Flat /.
Tom Friedman welcome /.
Good to be here Howie /.
thank you /.
The other day you wrote that if you were the editor of the New York Times you would 've led the paper with the news of recent days that a Sunni suicide bomber on Ramadan had attacked a Shiite mosque /.
Now in reality the world that you do n't rule New York Times Washington Post made that part of a larger story on Iraq /.
Uh nobody put it on the front page /.
Bad news judgement /?
Uh I think so Howie /.
I 'm not here to make a news point though /.
I 'm really making a larger point which is about the war on terrorism /.
I 'm a firm believer /.
How we ever going to win this war /?
We 're never going to win it by way of American intelligence finding this terrorist or that terrorist /.
We get lucky every once in a while /.
but there 's only {one?} way we win this war Howie is it takes a village /.
It only happens when the Sunni Muslim world basically turns people in and when the Sunni Muslim world restrains their own /.
And what was so shocking to me about this story a Sunni Jihadi suicide bomber blows up a mosque number one on the first day of Ramadan /.
What that tells you is that there 's no controlling moral authority today in the Sunni Muslim world /.
Well what is the bigger story /?
And that is a huge story /.
I think it should have been a big story /.
Why was n't /-
Is it because of Iraq fatigue /?
Um /.
I think it is yeah /.
Think it 's /-
Are all the editors and producers and new executives feeling another day another bombing ten killed twenty killed fifteen killed /.
and it does n't rise anymore to the top of the newscast or the front page /?
Right /.
Yeah and I think that 's right /.
There is Iraq fatigue /.
And there 's so much fatigue that we do n't sit back and say wait a minute /.
what happened today /?
A Sunni Muslim fundamentalist went into a mosque on the first day of Ramadan their holiest day /.
and no one says boo /.
this is civilization that when we accidentally or deliberately I do n't know abused the Koran people rioted in Pakistan /.
Yet their own houses of worship and holidays are being defiled /.
And I think it is a measure of how much we 've kind of lost been numbed by all of this that we do n't sit back and say wow wait a minute /.
that really crosses the line /.
and we have to call them on it even if they do n't /.
You 're recently back from Iraq /.
and you write about driving in from Kuwait /.
You were guarded by the US navy /.
and yet it was kind of a harrowing experience /.
Why so /?
Um you know the south of Iraq which is where I was the area around /.
This is the safe part /.
Right exactly /.
I was in the safe district /.
I was guarded uh by the British Royal Marines actually because unfortunately they 've had now um uh roadside bombs down there not suicide bombs /.
And it 's part of the general continuing insecurity of Iraq that um I 'm afraid has plagued this story from the very beginning /.
And it 's been I 've always felt the Achille 's heel /.
You know my criticism of the Bush administration as you know we 've talked about this before is not that this war is not important /.
I believe it is important much more important than I think the left has ever fully recognized /.
But it 's so much harder than the right has ever been willing to acknowledge /.
And on that trip you put on body armor /.
their rifles were out /.
Yeah /.
Um how does that affect your perception as a journalist /?
You 're there /.
you 're being protected /.
and you must have been a little bit nervous of what the safety situation is in there /.
Well I 'll tell you what 's really frustrating from a journalist 's point of view as one who have lived in Beirut for nearly five years covered that war /.
When I worked in Lebanon you could go anywhere on that story /.
You could cross lines /.
Journalists worked for the most part until the very end with Terry Anderson the kidnappings targets /.
Therefore by the end of the Lebanon story I thought the best journalists there knew more than the Lebanese /.
I always thought the best compliment you could get as a journalist is when you told the Lebanese something they did n't know because you were moving around so much /.
What 's so frustrating about the Iraq story Howie no one has a bird 's eye view /.
I care passionately about this story /.
I 'm so interested in it /.
but because of the securtiy situation you ca n't move around with the freedom you want /.
And the brave reporters who are there every day do n't have that freedom of movement either /.
And therefore it 's limited /.
and in fact as you know the administration says because of the security situation and maybe because of some biases in the media /.
There 's a lot of good things going on in Iraq /.
There 's a lot of progress being made we 're not seeing reported by the press /.
Do you think that is a credible argument at this point in the mess there /?
No because I do n't have a bird 's eye view /.
I wish I could say /.
I wish I could be so sure /.
but General Casey does n't have a bird 's eye view /.
And that 's why we get surprises in Iraq /.
Uh that 's why we had an election where eight million people suddenly turn out /.
and maybe you know we 're going to see more surpises in the coming future there /.
But because no one can move around with the freedom that you need to talk to everyone you do n't have that bird 's eye view /.
And as a reporter as a columnist who really cares about this story I find that really frustra- /-
I can not report it the way I 'd love to /.
So I 've been there five times /.
but it 's episodic /.
It 's here /.
It 's there /.
It 's never really putting your arms around the story /.
pulling back the camera a bit in recent months you 'd have to say that the Iraq story has been overshadowed by Katrina by Rita by Tom DeLay by Harriet Miers by Valerie Plame and now by this Pakistan earthquake /.
Um inevitable with a war that drags on and on /.
and these are all also important stories obviously /.
but uh do you feel it 's getting the attention that it should /?
Yeah /.
No because to me this is the whole ballgame of the Bush administration /.
Katrina and Rita they 'll come and go /.
but at the end of the day the Bush administration made a very big claim um that it could go to Iraq um and produce a decent forward looking government there /.
If that happens then I think President Bush is going to have a very huge quiver you know in his uh legacy there /.
Um if it does n't happen I think uh the administration will be seen as a complete and utter failure /.
so everything rides on this not just for the administration though but for the American people /.
These are huge stakes involved /.
And so I do n't think it 's gotten the attention it 's deserved /.
And going back again to one of your Iraq collumns uh you observed the Iraqi military there which after all is supposed to be increasingly shouldering the burden of this conflict /.
The slightly ragged quality left you feeling you write that if you pulled the US and British advisors out tomorrow the whole Iraqi navy would collapse /.
That 's a pretty pessimistic assessment and clearly at odds with what the White House and the Defense Department say every day /.
/.
Not at odds though with what actually the military commanders have been saying which is that the number of really trained Iraqi units you know are far fewer than sometimes suggested by the administration /.
So you 're saying there 's a gap between what real time military commanders on the ground are willing to tell you not necessarily on the record /.
You quoted one US senior official and what the President of the United States and the Vice President and the Secretary of Defense are saying to reporters every day /.
Are we calling them on that /?
Right I do n't think enough because there 's been a lot of happy talk around this Howie basically /.
And a lot of numbers are thrown out /.
Eighty thousand this week we 've got trained a hundred and twenty thousand next week /.
Here 's what you learn when you go to Iraq /.
Where you have an Iraqi commander who 's a real leader of soldiers okay you have a unit /.
And where you do n't have that commander you do n't have a unit /.
So the numbers the macro numbers do n't mean anything /.
So I went down to see the navy there /.
The navy of Iraq has a terrific commander /.
so the people around him they 'll follow him into battle /.
But you take that one guy out there 's no Iraqi navy /.
and it 's true of units all over the country /.
That 's really the key /.
You say that you are angry uh that Bush has fought the war as though it would be easy /.
Are you particularly angry as somebody who supported the war and took heat from some of your liberal friends for doing so /?
Yes /.
Absolutely because I believe this is important /.
I believe that something very big is at stake /.
We 're dealing with a Muslim Arab civilization right now that 's that 's in decline , that 's heading in the wrong direction in ways that are dangerous for them and I believe dangerous for the stability of the world /.
There 's something really important here at stake /.
and what makes me so angry at the Bush administration is not that they did n't frame the stakes /.
It is important /.
But they never never appreciated how difficult it was /.
They never prepared the army or the American people for how difficult it was /.
I mentioned the uh devastating earthquake in Pakistan a region you 're familiar with /.
Um clearly it 's become a pretty big story /.
but for the first couple days I noticed it was n't that much of a television story /.
and the reason was no pictures no video /.
No yes /.
Um but also maybe there was there a little bit less coverage because it 's in a remote part of the world /?
Uh Westerners are more interested in New Orleans than in Pakistan /?
I think all of the above /.
We 're so numbed also after Katrina and Rita /.
and now another earthquake /.
/.
It 's just become uh one natural disaster after another /.
to hear ten thousand twenty thousand forty thousand then it 's almost hard for a journalist to process /.
Right /.
And it was remote /.
and people are exhausted I think both viewers and reporters /.
Ahead have New York Times columnists been asked not to write about Judy Miller /?
More of my interview with Tom Friedman next /.
Welcome back to Reliable Sources now a full hour each week here in our new time slot ten to eleven o'clock eastern /.
More now of my conversation with New York Times columnist Tom Friedman about his book the new online charge to read him and Judy Miller /.
Now your new book The World is Flat I 've got it here /.
uh monster best seller more than a million copies better than any book you 've ever written before /.
Um you were recently profiled about this in Fortune magazine /.
and uh let 's just say that it did n't say you walked on water but it came close /.
Uh but one of the criticisms /-
What 's wrong with that /?
It says that you 're the composer of the nation 's talking points which was news to me /.
Uh one of the things it said was that uh in your book and in your writing that CEOs play a very central role /.
And the suggestion was well CEOs love you , you 're asked to speak at all these corporate events , maybe because you give them a very large uh share of the narrative /.
Yeah /.
Mhm /.
Mhm /.
That a reasonable observation /?
Yeah it is a reasonable observation /.
And my reaction to that is look if I want to understand the underlying technology that is flattening the world who do I go to /?
do I go to I do n't know Central America /?
Do I go to um uh the factory floor /?
Or do I go to the innovators and entrepeneurs who actually put all this together /?
So I make no apology for that at all /.
Um fact I would make a criticism of it /.
There are n't enough people during the last few years who actually went out and talked to the innovators who are doing all of these things who are actually reshaping the world /.
Just the opposite /.
We kind of had an Enron effect /.
and Enron effect was all CEOs are guilty unless proven innocent , therefore who wants to talk to them /?
And therefore I would argue -- /.
Wait a second /.
wait a second /.
Journalists uh subscribe to stereotypes because there are a few crooks at major corporations because you know they 're all bad guys /?
Yeah yeah /.
Yeah I would say /.
uh that 's a harsh uh assessment /.
I would say that there 's several things happened basically in the last three years /.
I would call it a perfect storm /.
One was nine eleven /.
That distracted us okay /.
The other was the Enron effect /.
You know no one wanted to be sort of seen with CEOs /.
And number three was the dot com bust which made everyone think well all this globalization technology stuff is really over /.
And as a result I would argue that really masked what is actually a fundemental inflection point the flattening of the world that we 're going from a vertical value creation model of command and control to a much more horizontal one of connect and collaborate /.
The argument of this book is that that shift is actually going to have as big an effect over time as Gutenberg and the printing press /.
And I would argue a little bit that it got missed because of all these other distractions /.
But it 's only had an effect on Tom Friedman 's career /.
In fact you were the Playboy interview /.
Hey put that paper down /.
/.
I bought it for the articles /.
Uh I enjoyed the interview /.
and you said in there that your wife uh edits all your columns and she says do n't publish it /.
Yes she does /.
You go back and rewrite it /.
I 'm afraid I do /.
/.
My wife Andrea edits them all /.
and when she gives me thumbs down Howie I have to put it in a ball throw it in the circular file and start over /.
and she 's a tough editor /.
Now your international readership on the New York Times website has gone down because of this new experiment the Times has where it costs forty nine ninety - five a year for non-subscribers at home to read Times columnists /.
That 's got to be disappointing for you /.
You know um I 'm torn /.
Uh and I 've said this to my bosses /.
Um I want my paper to thrive /.
and if we have a situation where young people grow up in the world that thinks that newspapers are things you read for free online who 's going to pay my travel expenses /?
And at the same time one of the greatest things about New York Times online is I got to reach an audience that just was exponential to what you got in the dead tree edition of the New York Times /.
And because I write about international affairs so I got a lot of young people in India and Egypt and whatnot /.
and for them fifty dollars that may be their tuition for half a year /.
So I 'm honestly torn /.
I really hope this works because I want the New York Times to have a platform that is sustainable /.
But at the same time I hope we can eventually find a way to re-engage those people because definitely we 've lost some of them /.
Eh in the Valerie Plame leak investigation there 's an allegation bouncing around the blogosphere that I just thought I would address with you which is have New York Times columnists somehow been told not to write about this because of Judy Miller 's involvement and being in jail , now being out of jail /.
absolutely not /.
Anybody tell you not to write about it /?
I mean they do n't tell me not to write about anything /.
Howie we are home alone okay /.
I mean I 'm going to China uh on Monday /.
and there 's only one person knows I 'm going /.
and that 's my assistant /.
So um /-
Did you even tell the boss /?
That 's right /. so there 's no edict out there /.
why people have n't written about it I do n't know /.
I 'm focused on other things /.
There 's a lot we do n't know obviously about the Judith Miller situation /.
but why do you think that she has gotten so much criticism /?
After all whether you agree with her or not this is a woman who believed in her convictions and went off to jail for eighty - five days /.
Um you know um Judy 's always been a pioneer and an agent of change you know um and uh has been at the forefront of a lot of stories /.
and people like that in our business um uh engender a lot of attention a lot of criticism and a lot of jealousy /.
Um and uh that 's the only way I can really explain /.
Tom Friedman /.
Up next did the media get carried away with last week 's subway terror alert /?
We 'll ride the rails into the spin cycle next /.
When New York mayor Mike Bloomberg announced last week that there was a possible terror threat against the city 's subways I thought here we go again /.
And television was all over the story /.
Here in New York tonight officials say they are increasing security on the city 's massive subway system because of what they call a significant and credible threat /.
The threat to attack the subways in coming days comes from overseas /.
and the police here will be searching bags briefcases even baby strollers to try to stop it /.
It was let 's face it irresistable /.
And since it was right there in the Big Apple cable anchors and correspondents could provide almost non-stop on the scene coverage /.
The threat concerns the New York City subway system behind me around me literally beneath our feet here in Times Square /.
The Fox News alert New York City subways are on a heightened state of alert this evening after what officials are describing as a specific threat /.
And the city 's tabloids were n't far behind /.
The problem as with so many previous terror alerts is that allegations from informants are inherently shaky /.
And some correspondents offered caveats of course /.
MSNBC anchor Keith Olbermann could n't help but notice on that day October six it was news that Karl Rove had been called back to testify in the CIA leak case and the white house is being assailed by conservatives over the Harriet Miers nomination /.
events that have been politically disadvantageous to the current administration have been uh occuring simultaneously or followed quickly upon with something related to terrorism on a big scale /.
By the next morning the New York Times and the Washington Post were reporting that federal authorities were playing down the threat as noncredible /.
But the TV coverage kept rolling down the track like the number four express /.
Finally last Tuesday some newspapers and then the cable networks reported that the whole thing was a hoax /.
The CBS evening news gave that three sentences /.
Well Jim Stewart of our Washington bureau quotes government sources tonight as saying the Iraqi man who gave that tip to US intelligence agents in Iraq now says the information was simply not true /.
But that 's a lot more than NBC Nightly News and ABC 's World News Tonight which did n't mention the great subway hoax at all /.
In an age of terror such threats obviously need to be reported /.
but given the unreliability of intelligence television ought to learn a lesson here about not going on high alert and scaring people /.
When we come back one network up the river without an explanation /.
Reporters are tired of the usual standups you know Howard Kurtz Oshkosh Wisconsin /.
They want to be riding on a train or walking in the rain or something to get attention /.
So when NBC 's Michelle Kosinski was covering some flooding in New Jersey for the Today Show Friday she set out in a canoe /.
And everything was going smoothly until /-
Well take a look /.
Good morning /.
Well obviously we 're getting a nice break from the rain but not the flooding /.
This is essentially now a part of the Passaic River in this neighborhood /.
Two guys walk into the shot /.
and we see that the water is only maybe four inches deep /.
Talk about shallow reporting /.
And as the Media Research Center pointed out this was right before the Today Show accused President Bush of staging his conversation with soldiers in Iraq /.
Well that 's it for this edition of Reliable Sources /.
Join us again next Sunday at our new time ten o'clock eastern seven pacific for a full hour of critiquing the media /.
Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer begins right now /.
This is Late Edition the last word in Sunday talk /.
All the indications we are getting even /.
Um , I think that the police should all have their own district of jurisdiction .
Uh-huh .
If he 's going to leave your , this , district of jurisdiction , there might be some problems when making an arrest .
It wo n't be as , this , convenient as in your own jurisdiction .
Ah , it 'll be troublesome .
Yes , yes , yes .
What do you do when you encounter such a situation .
I would have the security guards follow him and conceal myself well .
I myself , eh , am a plain - clothes policeman , so I would carry my work ID and wait somewhere he would show up .
Uh-huh .
Do n't move .
I took out my work ID from my pocket , see , I 'm a policeman ,
I am the local regional police officer here .
Well , I am the regional police officer for the something , something police post controlled in the West End .
What are you doing here .
I 'm not doing anything .
That 's not right .
One look at you tells me you 're up to no good .
Uh , I 've been watching you .
You 've been eyeing that lady 's pocket , that satchel .
Are you planning to steal it .
Are you carrying a knife .
I 'm not carrying a knife .
not good enough .
I have to search you .
So I quickly searched him .
There is a technique to this .
Doing the search I verified that he was carrying a tool used for criminal acts .
At this point , I did n't stop .
My eyebrows did n't move .
I did n't have any feeling .
Uh-huh .
ah , I quickly patted him down .
I do this everyday .
It was an awl , then I continued working downward .
I worked downward , working toward the shoes , moving toward the pant legs , lifting the pant legs , and then taking off the shoes and pulling out the cushions inside the shoes .
Uh-huh , nothing .
There was really nothing .
Uh-huh , well , I see that you do n't look like a good person still , right .
You see that .
It 's Haidian , Uh .
This is my stomping ground , ah .
So go to there .
When you 're there , I do n't care what you want to do .
Uh , go , go .
Ha , so in this way he was eh , coaxed back .
Yes , he was coaxed back .
After he was coaxed back , he again took his original path .
Uh-huh .
Then when he was caught , his entire process was filmed with a DV machine .
And is he still on your turf .
This version of events given on the spot will make ordinary people feel extremely happy .
Um , well , we also want to know , uh , in Britain , including its media and also the people , what kind of attitude they really have toward this incident .
Has the incident raised any worries locally regarding security .
Um , it 's fair to say that the British media is giving a lot of attention to the matter .
Recently , the large newspapers , the Times , Britain 's , uh , BBC , uh , this , the major media , we should say , uh , uh , have all devoted a lot of space to this matter .
Um , the reaction of Britain 's political community toward the incident , eh , can also be said to be very , um , er , er , sharp .
So , uh , one is that at the time , um , Britain very quickly summoned , um , the Russian , um , ambassador to Great Britain , uh , to ask that they promptly provide related information and , um , cooperation in the investigation over this affair .
Secondly , eh , um , the British Home Secretary Reid , eh , he has especially formed an investigation team , and , wants to assess together with experts the incident 's , um , um , possible effects on the British public .
So today , the 30th , well , the home secretary , eh , also need to explain this matter to the British parliament , eh , to the MPs , and undergo , um , questioning by the MPs .
How are Hong Kong 's relations with the mainland .
To describe it in one sentence , in the past the economic relationship consisted of everybody making money in Hong Kong and then spending it in the mainland .
But as the renminbi increases in value , many people today are speculating that in the future they might work hard in the mainland and then come to Hong Kong to enjoy life .
Is such a trend possible , Professor Ha .
Ah , I think , um , that when one works in the mainland and then comes to Hong Kong to spend money , um , there is a big difference in the wages between the two regions and maybe , um , the burden will be quite heavy , ah .
Uh-huh , but what everybody is most concerned about is how feasible it is to link the Hong Kong dollar , ah , to the renminbi .
many Hong Kong academics these days have come out with some calls for such a thing , oh .
What 's your opinion .
I think that , um , the market might have a wide variety of conjecture regarding , um , the Hong Kong dollar 's , ah , future and even the direction , eh , that policy on it might take , a wide variety of , er , expectations .
Right .
But , um , judging from the current situation , I personally think there is n't the basic support for linking the Hong Kong dollar and the renminbi .
Nor at the policy level is such a thing being considered .
Looking at the fundamentals , can we see why the renminbi is appreciating .
It 's because um , China 's current account surplus is quite large , ah , processing trade and the transit trade -- both are processing trade -- and this , regular trade all have , this , surplus .
Um , also , the growth in foreign exchange reserves has been quite rapid because the flow of money is n't outward .
You just said , ah , secondly , we need to look at the new products , and thirdly , look at the new technology .
Uh , yes , I have also heard of such a professional voice , that there is not a lot of new technology in the Beijing car show this time .
I believe this can be seen dialectically .
Yes .
Ah , eh , for any company to participate in an exhibition , first , its chief purpose in participating in this exhibition is to enter this market .
Within a period of time in the future , as the Chinese market , ah , with its spending trends , the direction of government policies , and the actual strength of national economic income , will all decide for the enterprise what type of technology and products they will showcase during this car exhibition .
So if we were to rate the Beijing Auto Show with other A - level exhibitions in the world , there was indeed a technological difference .
This is an objective fact .
But on the other hand , looking at the future of China 's consumer market , I think the new technology brought to this car show is sufficient for us Chinese who are in the auto industry to learn , eh , to catch up and to surpass .
Recently I 've had a , ah , feeling .
You know I was doing that Inside Big Cases program , right .
Yeah .
Yeah .
Oh , my lord !
always talking about these weird cases .
Of course , it 's possible that , this , the news media , uh , this , would deliberately search for murder , violence , and pornography .
Looking for the extraordinary .
But on the other hand , I would say that any of the cases they found , any single one , would still definitely make a big news story causing a sensation across the country , even if it happened in the US .
Uh-huh .
Why were there so many .
For example , psycho serial killers .
Uh-huh .
I tell you , at the peak I had head about almost three or four cases a month .
Uh-huh .
What was it all about .
Killing people by the dozen , raping the corpses , dismember the bodies , and dumping the bodies , they were mostly all the same kind of thing .
But there were n't many in mainland China who killed their family members , were there .
They killed other people .
There were very few who actually killed their own wives and children or entire families at home .
Er .
There were those who killed their own relatives , uh-huh .
There were also some .
There have been too , I 've heard of them too -- I 've heard of them too -- I 've heard of them too .
You know , recently , this , an old professor called Professor Liu Xiwei published some views in Southern Weekend , that have stirred up a huge controversy .
Yeah .
Uh-huh .
Well , Professor Ji , uh , what position and task has North Korea brought with it when it came to participate in the six - party talks this time .
I think , this , North Korea 's consideration may include such two perspectives , eh , the short - term and the long - term considerations ,
From the short - term perspective , eh , it still mainly wants to relieve its current pressure and resolve the issue of the two sanctions .
One is the US financial sanctions ; the other is the sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council Resolution 1718 .
Uh-huh .
Well , from the long - term perspective , the purpose , um , of North Korea 's participation in the six - party talks , eh , is also to resolve issues of its concern through the process , eh , of denuclearization of the peninsula .
This , there may be , er , quite a number of concerns , yet the most important one remains the security concern , an issue of its relations with the US .
Uh-huh .
Well , what needs to be emphasized here is that prior to , this , this session of talks , North Korea has repeatedly stressed that it is already a nuclear country now .
So in the future , the issue of the nuclear - free peninsula , uh , will not be merely an issue of , this , North Korea 's nuclear abandonment itself but will also include the issue of disarmament on the entire peninsula .
Yeah .
Dealing with serial crimes per se /.
We can see the emerging behavior /.
we can see that this is a behavior that is not going to stop /.
You can have hundreds of individuals as suspects and can narrow the focus of your investigation to a smaller pool of people /.
And it gives you a starting point /.
The good news is even though at any given point in time that there are these people out there perpetrating these crimes we are getting better at catching them and better at catching them sooner So that instead of waiting until they 've committed twelve crimes or instead of having twelve murders take place before we catch somebody now we may catch them after the first or second murder /.
I will never in my lifetime learn why a serial killer becomes a serial killer /.
But maybe the work that I 'm doing now will be able to take other people down avenues to explore with more tools with more ability to experiment with more ability to study on a hands - on basis /.
But I will never learn that /.
As a psychologist through all the interviews that I 've conducted all the cases that I 've reviewed what I 've learned is that these people while bright um and while at some level charming are emotionally and spiritually bankrupt /.
and I 've learned that there is such a thing as evil /.
While criminal profiling has been the topic of best selling books and award winning films it is merely one tool used to solve crimes /.
The fact is that often offenders are caught while committing minor crimes like traffic violations or simply because they raise suspicion of local police /.
That 's our crime files investigation /.
I 'm John Seganthaler /.
From NBC news in Washington this is Meet The Press with Tim Russet /.
Our issues this Sunday North Korea 's Kim Jong - Il defies the world testing long range missiles which one day could deliver nuclear warheads /.
Can this man be stopped /?
With us from the Bush administration the third ranking official at the state department Ambassador Nicholas Burns The former Assistant Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter of Harvard University 's Kennedy school of government The man who led the negotiations for the nineteen ninety four nuclear agreement with North Korea Robert Gallucci Dean of the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University And the former US Ambassador to the United Nations who has visited North Korea five times Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico /.
And in our Meet the Press Minute former President Gerald Ford turns ninety three this week /.
He last appeared as president on Meet the Press thirty one years ago when he talked about age as a state of mind /.
But first North Korea /.
on the fourth of July North Korea tested medium and long range +missiles /.
and their nuclear program appears to be full speed ahead /.
What is the Bush administration going to do about it /?
Here with us the Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns /.
Mr. Ambassador good morning /.
Thank you Tim /.
good morning /.
Will the United States insist that the United Nations impose sanctions against North Korea /?
Well we are pursuing a very aggressive resolution up in New York at the Security Council /.
and we think we 've got the votes to pass that /.
But we 're also operating on multiple diplomatic fronts /.
We have our lead negotiator Chris Hill Ambassador Hill in Beijing Seoul and Tokyo this week /.
President Bush and Secretary Rice have been working the phones with uh their counterparts /.
And we 've also had a very interesting development today /.
the Chinese Government is sending tonight to a senior delegation /.
And you know frankly we think it 's time for China to use its influence with North Korea /.
The Chinese have influence certainly more than the United States and the other members of the international community dealing with this problem /.
China now has an opportunity to put its best foot forward , to send the North Koreans a direct message that these missile tests can not be tolerated and the North Koreans now have to come back to the September nineteenth two thousand five agreement and they 've got to denuclearize give up their nuclear ambitions and abide by the agreement that they made with the rest of us nearly a year ago /.
But the South Koreans and the Chinese have both said they do not believe there should be sanctions against North Korea /.
Will the US absolutely insist that there be sanctions in the UN resolution /?
If you look at this UN resolution that 's under debate in New York it does /.
it 's a chapter seven resolution so it has the effect of compulsory behavior by all the member states /.
It says that what the North Koreans did was a threat to international peace and security /.
It does ask all member states not to engage in nuclear trade with North Korea /.
That strikes us as an obvious point /.
And I think what we have to do we 'll see a lot of diplomacy over the next couple of days /.
we 'll have to see how the Chinese and Russians react to this /.
but our view is that the five parties ought to remain united and that the goal of the current diplomacy should be to use the combined leverage of China and Russia 's of South Korea Japan and the United States to force the North Koreans back to the negotiating table /.
That 's certainly the best policy for the United States /.
Force the North Koreans back to the negotiating table /.
there are many as you know Mister Ambassador who believe the North Koreans did this launch on the fourth of July to get our attention Because they saw the way we were treating Iran differently than we were treating North Korea /.
Here 's one Nicholas Burns on National Public Radio /.
With Iran the United States has made an offer /.
and that is we are willing to sit down and negotiate with the Iranians assuming and contingent upon their suspension of their nuclear activities at their plant in the in Iran /.
Why not sit down in the same way with North Koreans Say to them stop developing your program /.
and we 'll sit down with you one on one /.
Well Tim we 're trying to sit down with the North Koreans in the context of the six party talks /.
We 've been saying for months now that the right step forward is for North Korea to return to these talks /.
but we really do n't see the logic in turning this into a test of wills between two countries the United States and North Korea /.
The fact is that China has the same interest as the United States /.
It should have the same interest /.
And that is to stop the North Korea nuclear program /.
Our allies Japan and South Korea have the same interests /.
and the Russians do as well /.
And so we think we 're far better off working within the framework of the six party talks because you get in that process the combined leverage the combined strength and frankly the combined pressure on North Korea of all these different countries /.
I simply do n't see why it 's in the interest of the United States to get those countries out of the way and only deal with North Korea directly /.
So the problem here is not the lack of discussion between the United States and North Korea /.
We 're perfectly willing to sit down with them in that six party environment /.
and in that sense it 's analogous to what we 're trying to do with Iran /.
Secretary Rice announced about a month ago that should the Iranians meet the condition of suspension of their own nuclear activities we 'd be willing to sit down in another multilateral forum /.
and that 's with the Europeans and Russians and Chinese /.
So really you know the North Korea problem is not a problem just for the United States /.
What they did the other day on July fourth was to disrupt the peace and harmony of their relations with the Asian countries /.
And the Asian countries want to be involved in these negotiations /.
Is it the policy of the Bush administration that we 'd like to see regime change in North Korea /?
Well this is one of the most despotic regimes in the world /.
it 's a major human rights violator /.
There 's massive famine /.
And certainly we hope for the day will come when those people will live in peace and be governed by a different type of government /.
Uh what we 've got to do now of course is focus on the most immediate problem /.
And that problem is nuclear weapons /.
The problem is the ballistic launches of the other day /.
I think the thing to remember about those launches by the way they were provocative , they were reckless , they were also unsuccessful /.
They fired four scud missiles intermediate range missiles /.
They tried to fire the longer range missile the /.
and that was spectacularly unsuccessful /.
It crashed in the sea of Japan /.
So we obviously have an opportunity now for diplomacy . And an opportunity to use the combined strength of all these countries to provide some leverage put some leverage against the North Koreans /.
and that 's what we will continue to try to do in the coming days and coming weeks /.
Will the United States give North Korea security assurances that we will not attack their country or seek to undermine their regime /?
If you look back at this historic agreement that was signed in the six party frameworks on September nineteenth of two thousand five those types of assurances are in that agreement /.
But the North Koreans have obligations /.
and that is to take down their nuclear program dismantle it dismantle their weapons of mass destruction programs in a verifiable way before all those assurances can go into place /.
All the other elements of the agreement can be put into place /.
And what we 've seen since then is we 've seen the United States and Russia and China and Japan and South Korea willing to go forward willing to sit down willing to implement this entire agreement that you just referred to Tim /.
but we see the North Koreans walking away from it /.
So we 've got to be very persistent and frankly very tough in combining with these other countries to pressure the North Koreans to live up to their commitments /.
But we would be willing to give North Korea increased economic aid perhaps light nuclear reactors for peaceful means and security assurance if in fact they sat down and negotiated /?
The North Koreans know what 's in the September nineteenth agreement /.
and it 's very specific about what the United States is willing to do uh to take a step forward towards them should they dismantle all their nuclear programs and their weapons of mass destruction /.
But they 've got responsibilities in this agreement /.
and no agreement is whole until both sides meet their agreement /.
And what we 've seen Tim especially on July Fourth is the North Koreans in outright violation of the agreement that we made with them last September /.
Why do you think the North Koreans chose July Fourth /?
Oh I do n't think it was coincidental /.
You know it 's a very unreliable and unpredictable regime /.
The last thing we want to do is react to every wild statement that they make /.
but they certainly chose that to get our attention and that of the international community /.
Uh but what they 've got to realize is there is no magic bullet here /.
They ca n't just think that they can sit down with the United States alone /.
That does n't work for Japan /.
it does n't work with South Korea /.
and frankly it does n't work with the Chinese /.
So I said before that one of the most interesting developments here is this Chinese delegation going to /.
And Chris Hill our ambassador was in China a few days ago /.
he made the point and Secretary Rice made the point yesterday to the Chinese Foreign minister , we want to see China use its influence /.
We want to see China push forward and ask the North Koreans to meet these commitments that they 've made to all of us /.
Speaker Newt Gingrich the former speaker Republican weighed in on this debate in this way /.
he offered this /.
The time to replace the state department 's failed North Korea strategy of talk forever , act never has come /.
For thirteen years the United States has talked loudly about a North Korea nuclear weapons and ballistic missile threat /.
For thirteen years the North Korean dictatorship has lied and hunkered down and continued to build nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles /.
The strategy of talking has failed /.
America 's actions must be decisive or faced with a brutal totalitarian dictatorship about which we know little /.
It is acting in defiance of all its own international commitments /.
But the time for talk is over /.
either they dismantle the missile /.
or we the United States should dismantle it /.
Well uh with all due respect to Speaker Gingrich we are on a course which has a reasonable chance of success /.
And you never want to disavow a diplomatic track a negotiating track if you think you can resolve the problem in that fashion /.
And as I said before we are not alone in this endeavor /.
we have countries united with us who can apply the same type of pressure /.
I will say this what the North Koreans have done over the past week is going to give a lot of strength in our efforts to develop a missile defense system /.
You 've seen very strong statements by the Japanese government wanting to work with us in that realm /.
So obviously we 're going to pursue a very tough very decisive policy over the coming weeks designed to focus the North Koreans on their obligations To pressure them to come back to the talks But also certainly to provide for our own defense and the defense of our treaty allies in Asia /.
And I think you 'll see us move ahead smartly in that direction as well /.
Uh Mister Ambassador many critics will say the six years George Bush has been president North Korea 's program has developed rather dramatically That the policy at first of isolation and then the six party talk just has n't worked /.
Here 's the latest study from the Institute for Science and International Security /.
They estimated a report that North Korea has enough separated plutonium to develop now an arsenal of four to thirteen nuclear weapons compared with estimates of just one or two weapons in two thousand when George bush became president /.
The group says that by two thousand eight North Korea could have enough plutonium for eight to seventeen nuclear weapons /.
The group 's assessment based on analysis of satellite imagery media reports and statements by North Korean officials which lead Nick Everstat a conservative critic from the American Enterprise Institute these are not Democrats /-
he offered this /.
although the Bush administration 's rhetoric about Kim Jong - Il and his regime has sometimes seemed ferocious North Korea 's leaders seem to have concluded that the Bush North Korea policy consists mainly of empty words and that oft repeated warning need not be taken terribly seriously /.
By more than one criteria indeed strategic successes on the Bush watch outshine those from its during the Clinton years /.
Would you acknowledge a significant increase in the nuclear capability by North Korea on the watch of President Bush /?
Tim um obviously we profoundly disagree with um some of the statements that we 've just heard /.
Eh you know we 've got a very strong military force and deterrent force at work in Asia and particularly on the Korean peninsula /.
And that military can handle any contingency that should arise /.
We also have a very tough policy and I think forward looking policy to develop missile defense to handle those contingencies /.
But you 've got to combine military measures with diplomacy to be effective in a situation like this /.
The fact is that a lot of this criticism seems to direct the United States back to a test of wills bilaterally between North Korea and the United States /.
What we want to do is we want to ask countries that do have a great deal of influence on North Korea certainly more than we have to use that influence /.
We can do that by channeling those efforts through the six party framework /.
And you know diplomacy sometimes ca n't succeed in a day or two or a week or two /.
Sometimes it takes many months or even years to succeed /.
But if you have the right policy in place , if you know what you 're trying to accomplish and if you 're very tough - minded about applying that policy we can be successful /.
So we have not given up hope that we can engineer a policy that will effectively put the North Koreans back in the box take away their nuclear programs and take away their ability to inflict threats and damage on their neighbors /.
We have got to be single - minded about this /.
we certainly understand the gravity of a challenge posed by North Korea /.
but frankly I do n't think these critics have offered any alternative that would have a reasonable prospect of success or lead us to unintended consequences uh if you went down the road that some of them are suggesting /.
And we think we 've got the right policy in place /.
and I can assure you we 're going to drive with a great deal of energy and determination /.
But you do not deny that North Korea 's nuclear capability has increased during the presidency of George Bush /?
Well North Korea says that it has a nuclear weapons capability /.
and we believe that it has produced that over the last several years /.
and that 's why we 've put in place this policy designed to take it away from them /.
And if we can have the September nineteenth two thousand five agreement implemented it will do just that /.
It will effectively de-nuclearize North Korea /.
And so that is a good bet for the United States /.
It 's obviously the goal that I think all these critics that you cite would share /.
But we think we 've got a much more realistic in the real world strategy put in place to deal with that problem /.
But there has been a profound change in the rhetoric certainly of the President on this subject /.
Here 's the President Friday at this news conference in Chicago about North Korea /.
It takes a while for a problem to fester and grow /.
and then it takes a while to solve them diplomatically /.
It just 's the nature of diplomacy /.
Wish we could solve them overnight /.
And let me go back to January of two thousand two in the President 's axis of evil speech before congress /.
Let 's watch /.
North Korea has a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction While starving its citizens /.
States like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil arming to threaten the peace of the world /.
By seeking weapons of mass destruction these regimes pose a grave and growing danger /.
We 'll be deliberate /.
yet time is not on our side /.
I will not wait on events while dangers gather /.
I will not stand by as peril draws closer and closer /.
The United States of America will not permit the world 's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world 's most destructive weapons /.
Since the President uttered those words Mister Ambassador every estimate is that North Korea has doubled its capacity to develop nuclear weapons /.
And yet we 've driven forward with this policy designed to respond to all the things the President talked about back in two thousand two /.
But he has been very consistent since then in putting forward the proposition that we have to oppose the human rights abuses of the government /.
We have to try to draw a net around the fact that North Korea is the leading exporter of ballistic missile technology around the world The proliferator of it /.
we 've done a lot to develop missile defense /.
And we 've created and driven forward this diplomatic coalition designed to bring us to a victory in denying North Korea the nuclear weaponry that you talk about /.
So we have been very activist /.
We have followed this policy for a number of years /.
Uh the President is right /.
And as I said before diplomacy ca n't be measured in a snapshot /.
You ca n't just say in a Sunday morning in July that somehow because we have n't come to the end of negotiations these negotiations are bound to fail /.
You 've got to be very purposeful and directed in what you 're trying to do and apply the weight of your country and that of others to the test /.
And that 's what we 're doing /.
We have not given up on this quest to come to the end of these negotiations and put the North Koreans back into a place where they can no longer be a threat to their neighbors or to the United States /.
But again it 's the tone and the rhetoric /.
Let me go back and review some of the things the President has said about Kim Jong - Il of North Korea /.
I loathe Kim Jong - Il /.
I got a visceral reaction to this guy /.
And then in two thousand four there 's a tyrant in North Korea that wants to develop a nuclear weapon /.
And then this in two thousand two /.
the President called him a pygmy And compared him to a spoiled child at a dinner table /.
Does the President still believe that Kim Jong - Il is a tyrant a pygmy and a spoiled child /.
Kim Jong - Il is a despot /.
And he is someone who is one of the worst offenders of human rights all over the world /.
Uh these missile tests the other day were certainly reckless /.
They were provocative /.
And so uh we have n't changed our opinion of the nature of the regime in North Korea /.
No one in our government has /.
We are very clear - eyed about who they are , what they represent , how much they 've denied their own people the basic human rights that people should have around the world /.
And we 're focused on this nuclear question as well /.
So I think there 's been a lot of continuity over American policy both in the substance of the policy and in the way we 've talked about North Korea over the last several years /.
And uh we 're determined to press ahead /.
When the president talked about the axis of evil he said Iraq North Korea and Iran /.
The United States invaded one of those countries Iraq /.
Some now make the case that Iran and North Korea took from that the following lesson that if you develop a nuclear bomb and have a strong military you will not be invaded by the US /.
And both of those countries have clearly miscalculated their own situation /.
Now the North Koreans felt I guess that by testing these ballistic missiles they would somehow put themselves in a position of greater weight in the negotiations /.
They 've miscalculated because you 've seen very tough statements from the Chinese and the Russians and the South Koreans and the Japanese against what they 've done /.
and you see momentum building in the UN security council toward a very tough chapter seven resolution against them /.
The Iranians have miscalculated /.
They thought that they could divide the United States from both our European allies and from Russia and China /.
But we 've been able to craft a major and united coalition of all those countries /.
And we 've essentially given the Iranians a clear choice /.
And you 'll see a lot of this unfold this week both in Europe when Secretary Rice meets with her counterparts on Wednesday at the GA summit in St. Petersburgh At the end of the week when the president is there /.
the Iranians are going to have to choose /.
Negotiations with us after they suspend their nuclear programs or further action in the Security Council /.
So I do n't think either of these countries is on the offensive /.
Frankly I think both of these countries are rather cornered and isolated /.
There are very few countries defending them /.
and they 're running out of options /.
So we think this policy of patient diplomacy and of crafting multilateral coalitions to tighten the pressure around them is going to work /.
And it 's the right way to go clearly for the United States /.
we want to exhaust diplomatic means before we consider other means /.
Based on our experience in Iraq particularly with our emphasis on the weapons of mass destruction that did not materialize John Deutch the former head of the CIA offered this observation /.
the next time military intervention is judged necessary to combat the spread of weapons of mass destruction for example North Korea there will be skepticism about the quality of our intelligence /.
Do you agree with that /?
I do n't /.
not in the case of North Korea not in the case of Iran /.
Tim I 've been to Europe twenty times over the last fourteen months to talk to the Europeans and the Russians and Chinese about Iran for instance /.
There 's not a single person at the higher levels of those government who does n't believe Iran is trying to create a nuclear weapons capability /.
There is n't a single person in the governments of China or Russia or South Korea or Japan who does n't believe that North Korea is bent on building up its nuclear capability /.
There is no argument in the real world today about what these two countries Iran and North Korea are trying to do /.
There is no argument remotely similar to what we went through in two thousand and two and three with our European allies over Iraq /.
In fact we are now tightly knit up with these countries /.
And if you look at what the French German and British governments are saying as well as the Russian and Chinese governments about whether or not these countries are intending to create a nuclear weapons capability they agree with our assessment /.
So I do n't agree at all that we 're somehow limited in what we can do and limited in our effectiveness because of the disagreements that we had over WMD in Iraq /.
Let me conclude with comments by Bill Crystal the editor of Weekly Standard /.
he used to work for Vice President Dan Quail /.
North Korea is firing missiles /.
Iran is going nuclear /.
Somalia is controlled by radical Islamists /.
Iraq is n't getting better /.
and Afghanistan is getting worse /.
I give the President a lot of credit for hanging tough on Iraq /.
but I am worried that it has made them too passive in confronting the other threats /.
Have a preoccupation with Iraq allowed North Korea and Iran to go forward with their nuclear programs and limited our options /?
Well I strongly disagree with that criticism from Bill Crystal /.
And I disagree for one reason /.
We have a very strong and active government /.
from the Pentagon from the State Department the White House Treasury we are focused on all these problems /.
We created over the last fifteen months a major international coalition to corner the Iranian government And to isolate them /.
And that 's been a diplomatic success over the last several months /.
We 've now got this six party talk framework we hope coming back together /.
and certainly the five countries are united /.
Uh Secretary Rumsfeld was in Afghanistan this morning /.
and Secretary Rice was there ten days ago /.
and we 're giving that government president government all the support it can get /.
We are a government that can operate /.
and we have to operate in every part of the world /.
We 're a global superpower /.
We have tremendous resources at our disposal /.
and frankly we 've got a first class military and a first class diplomatic effort /.
and we can certainly take on all these issues and be successful simultaneously /.
And we will be watching /.
Ambassador Nicholas Burns we thank you for sharing your views /.
Thanks Tim /.
Coming next the view of three former Clinton Administration officials who spent years dealing with the North Korea problem former Assistant Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter chief State Department negotiator now at the Georgetown University Robert Gallucci And former US ambassador to the UN now Governor of New Mexico Bill Richardson /.
They are all right here next only on Meet The Press /.
And we are back /.
Welcome all /.
Governor Richardson should the United States negotiate directly one on one with North Korea /?
Yes it should /.
Uh our policy so far is not working /.
Uh what you have is North Korea has quadrupled its enriched plutonium since two thousand and two /.
Uh the six party talks are going nowhere /.
We should talk directly to the North Koreans to discuss what is next /.
They need to dismantle their nuclear weapons /.
they need to destroy their missile capability /.
The only way to do that in my judgment is face to face talks at a level of Christopher Hill /.
He is a competent diplomat /.
Uh the successes we 've had with the North Koreans have been through direct engagement When I got some pilots out of North Korea When Bob Gallucci negotiated the agreed framework /.
Secretary Albright close to having an agreement on reducing or terminating their missiles /.
What North Korea is seeing right now is Iran getting a nuclear reactor /.
They see Iran getting a nuclear fuel cycle that is assured economic incentives /.
On the other hand what they want to see is treated with respect direct talks with the United States /.
But also they want to see an effort by the United States to give them the recognition that they feel they deserve /.
I do n't believe they do /.
They are a desolate isolated regime /.
But right now our policy is not working /.
It makes sense to talk directly with North Korea /.
But would n't the world then say oh I see /.
you test a missile on the fourth of July /.
you get the US attention /.
and you bring them to the bargaining table /.
Our policy right now does not work /.
Look where we are right now /.
Uh Asia is destabilized /.
We are trying to outsource our foreign policy to China /.
I believe China is not necessarily interested in helping us on North Korea /.
They do n't want to see a bunch of refugees go into their country /.
I believe that China is a competitor /.
They control a lot of our debt /.
Right now we do not have leverage over China /.
The best effort in my judgment is face to face talks /.
Hard negotiating /.
Get that agreement that was uh signed in September that North Korea has not abided to /.
A time table for North Korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons /.
Efforts to set up bench marks in exchange for that armistice agreement where we do n't attack North Korea /.
They get economic assistance /.
But our objective should be firm /.
To get them to dismantle their nuclear weapons /.
The best way to do it is face to face talks /.
If the President now changed his course wo n't the headlines be Bush blinks /?
No /.
I believe the headlines would be Bush deals realistically with North Korea /.
He reverses a policy that is not working /.
Ambassador Gallucci do you agree with that /?
Just about entirely /.
uh I have nothing against the idea of the six party talks something Nick pounded on /.
Uh uh the virtue of having all these parties in Asia engaged that 's /-
it 's true /.
it is their problem as well as ours /.
But the fact is it has n't worked /.
And to make the form more important than a substance To care more about whether we have six parties meeting together than whether we stop the accumulation of plutonium is absurd in my view /.
You 'd have some conditions /.
you had said prior to the missile test that if they took that missile off the launch pad you 'd negotiate face to face /.
Now that they 've launched it would you have any conditions before you went back to the table one on one /?
This is kind of a rule I think that you really try hard not to negotiate with a gun or missile to your head /.
And I think a decent interval now and some work at the United Nations is the appropriate thing to do /.
But I think we 're taking a view from thirty thousand feet right now /.
what should the administration do /?
It needs to find a way to get back to the negotiating table /.
And the fact that you may get a headline like the President is reversing course as indeed we have in the case of Iran that 's not so bad if you find you 're on the wrong course /.
and we have been /.
Ashton Carter do you agree there should be one on one direct negotiations between North Korea and the US /?
No I actually think the six party talks is a perfectly appropriate forum including for us to speak directly to the North Koreans if others are at the table /.
Let 's go back to the logic of the six party talks in the first place /.
The reason to have everybody at the table with the North Koreans is not only that they have a stake in the outcome as well but uh in dealing with North Korea diplomacy has to have a coercive dimension /.
And we do n't trade with North Korea /.
we do n't recognize North Korea diplomatically /.
uh there 's almost nothing we can do short of military action to apply pressure to North Korea /.
We 're capable of military action /.
and it 's important that that be an ingredient of course in diplomacy /.
But the real levers on Kim Jong - Il are the Chinese and the South Koreans /.
It is they who essentially support the regime economically and politically /.
But makes sense to have them at the table /.
The six party talks I totally agree with my colleagues here have produced nothing so far except a quadrupling of the amount of plutonium as ambassador Richardson said um in North Korean hands and now missile launches /.
So they 've been running wild for three years or so /.
Um the reason for that /-
there 's a lot of blame to go around /.
you have to start with the North Koreans and their own intransigence /.
The Chinese and the South Koreans have not done everything that they should /.
uh they 've shown the carrots /.
they 've been unwilling to show the sticks that they can also wield /.
I think on our side um it matters less who else is at the table than that we have our own wits about us as we sit down with the North Koreans /.
And our government I believe has been divided over the last few years as the six party talks between two camps /.
One camp which believes that we have to give diplomacy a try and is earnest about pursuing diplomacy with North Korea /.
But there 's another camp uh in this country and I think represented in the government that believes that negotiating with the North Koreans is a fools game or is even immoral because of the nature of the regime /.
I do n't agree with that view because I think it 's more immoral to let North Korea go nuclear than to try to reach a deal with North Korea /.
But we have been of two minds /.
and therefore I do n't think we at the table has been as effective as we might have been /.
you showed some of that ambivalence in the earlier part of your segment where you see the US government saying one thing at one time and another thing at the other times /.
Though it 's important that we get our story straight /.
and that 's more important than who else is at the table /.
You had advocated several weeks ago a preemptive military strike on the missile that was about to be tested /.
Many criticize that as belligerent /.
and perhaps could even trigger a North Korea response against South Korea or against Japan /.
who knows /.
In hindsight do you still stand by that preemptive military strike /?
Well I do /.
and I want to put that in some context /.
By the way I would say we should have that same position today That is if the North Koreans go out to the launch pad and erect that missile and prepare to launch it we can destroy that uh before they can do it /.
To do so would be a very limited military action a single bomb a single cruise missile /.
the north Koreans are n't going to start a war in response uh to that kind of action /.
And to those that think that 's too much I can only say where are you going to draw a line in the sand with North Korea /?
At some point we have to draw a line in the sand and defend it /.
We say things are intolerable /.
we say they 're unacceptable /.
and then we tolerate and accept /.
former Secretary of Defense Bill Perry and I thought long and hard about this /.
and we thought that this was a relatively nonprovocative way to draw a line in the sand with North Koreans /.
Now I have to emphasize there 's risk in inaction also /.
you may say there 's risk in this action /.
but I have to emphasize there 's risk in inaction as well letting North Korea go nuclear /.
Governor Richardson well how do you think the North Koreans would react if we took out their test missile /?
Well I respectfully disagree with Assistant Secretary Carter there /.
But at least he 's got a new idea which the administration does not put forth /.
I think if we are seriously attacked or threatened , that missile which was a test was geared to the United States or to our allies we have allied responsibilities with South Korea or Japan /. /.
Uh you do take that step /.
but the fact is that you risk uh the uh North Koreans shooting missiles at South Korea /.
and we 've got thirty seven thousand American forces at the DMZ /.
Uh but Tim I think another reason for the face to face talks is that there 're two issues that are separate from the six party talks that are a serious grievance in our relationship /.
one is the fact that we have frozen financial assets of the North Koreans /.
I believe rightly so /.
but that is a separate bilateral issue /.
The second is our objection to dealing with North Koreans ' request for a light water reactor Which I believe has bogged down the six party talks /.
Which by the way I believe you could have a separate bilateral face to face negotiation with the United States and also continue the efforts with the six party talks because it is the South Koreans and the Japanese that are providing financial and fuel incentives /.
So you ca n't cut them out /.
but I think it 's essential to have face to *face private bilateral talks between United States and North Korea /.
But in the end it 's a judgment of North Korean intentions /.
You 'd been there five times /.
you know them /.
and yet a few weeks before the missile launch you said I do n't think they 're going to test /.
And they did /.
No Tim I said I believe that they were going to test /.
I did say that /.
And what I sense in my negotiations in dealing with North Koreans /-
You said as days go by I do n't believe they 're going to do it /.
But early on I said that they did on CBS /.
Uh my point is that when you deal with North Korea you 're not dealing with individuals like you and me /.
Do n't believe in compromise /.
they believe in their only way or the highway /.
Their view is that their cause is right /.
and they 're going to wait you out /.
So they 're totally unpredictable /.
and I believe the only way to deal with them and we have shown that effectively in past dealings with the Clinton Administration is direct engagement To get them to curb their nuclear weapons as Bob Gallucci did /.
Secretary Albright almost got a missile agreement /.
Uh Jimmy Carter got uh an agreement which was later violated regrettably with the father Kim Jong - Il /.
My point is that face to face discussions with the United States directly I believe is a precursor /.
the continuation of the six party talks is the best way to go /.
But do they keep their word /?
Here 's Madeline Albright toasting Kim Jong - Il in North Korea October of two thousand /.
She appeared on this program four years later /.
and this was our exchange /.
But did n't North Korea develop a nuclear bomb on Bill Clinton 's watch /?
No what they were doing uh as it turns out , they were cheating /.
and the reason that you have arms control agreements is that you do n't make them with your friends , you make them with your enemies /.
and it is the process that is required to hold uh countries accountable /.
Ambassador Gallucci you negotiated that ninety four agreement /.
The North Koreans stopped processing in one plant if you will /.
but we later found out that at the same time they were making uranium in another plant /.
Not actually /.
No that 's not what we found out /.
What happened was we did do a deal /.
We did stop a uh plutonium based pro-nuclear weapons program /.
We made sure that eight thousand fuel rods containing around thirty kilograms enough for five nuclear weapons worth of plutonium stayed in a storage pond /.
And the deal would have had the North Koreans end their nuclear weapons program /.
We think they started cheating in the late nineties by getting some gas centrifuge equipment from Pakistan /.
We do n't know a lot about that where it is whether the equipment has been put together /.
We think over a period of time they 'll do what the Pakistanis did , what the Iranians appear to be wanting to do and put together this gas centrifuge /.
But they never got there yet /.
Or we do n't think they 've gotten there yet /.
But they broke their word /.
They absolutely cheated /.
There 's no question about that /.
But really you ought to be clear here what 's happened /.
There was a nuclear weapons program that was stopped /.
Plutonium production was stopped /.
Right /.
And afterwards tragically I believe that agreement which locked them up was allowed to collapse /.
And we find ourselves now with the North Koreans accumulating plutonium a bomb 's worth a year /.
And freed up that plutonium that was um controlled for that period of time /.
And they say they 've used it to make bombs /.
we 'd have to estimate about five more /.
And with each passing day I would argue to you more important than that missile that Ash would take out on the gantry if it turns up again with each passing day we 're going to find ourselves more and more closer than we were before to the day where that material could be transferred or sold to Al - Queda Presenting a threat far greater than the threat that is posed to us by nuclear weapons aboard ballistic missiles /.
We can deter a country with ballistic missiles /.
We know the return address /.
We do /.
But with a terrorist unconventional delivery your national missile defense will not be very good against United Airlines or American Airlines Or a bus or a truck /.
And deterrents does n't work terribly well when an enemy values your death more than his life /.
So no defense no deterrents /.
we need to lock up the nuclear program /.
You would not care about the ballistic missile program if they did not have the nuclear weapons program /.
But you can have all the agreements you want /.
if they 're going to cheat what good are they /?
Madeline Albright essentially had it correct in my view /.
You make a deal /.
Nobody did that deal in ninety four thinking we were trusting North Koreans /.
We had some transparency a measure of it /.
and you verify /.
We caught them cheating /.
You might make another deal /.
I think you should /.
You ask the question you make another deal are you better off with the deal /.
or are you better off without it /?
If the answer to the former is yes you do the deal /.
You do n't +ask I think the simple question have they fooled us before /.
then do n't let them fool us again /.
I do n't believe that 's the way you proceed in international affairs /.
It asks a very tough question about the national security /.
should we do this /?
Is it better for us /?
Ask for more transparency /.
Insist on it /.
Be tough in the negotiations Not in the formality of whether it 's six parties or it 's bilateral /.
Let me show you all two presidents Bill Clinton back in nineteen ninety three George Bush ten years later talking to the North Koreans in effect /.
And I 'm asking you to put your mind in place of a North Korean watching this /.
President Clinton President Bush /.
North Korea can not be allowed to develop a nuclear bomb /.
We had to be very firm about it /.
We will not tolerate nuclear weapons in North Korea /.
Ash Carter both presidents making very firm resolved statements /.
if you 're in North Korean watching that knowing that you now have the potential of building eight nuclear bombs what are you thinking /?
Well I 'm concerned that they 're thinking that we 're giving a new meaning to the word intolerable Because they keep doing things that we say are intolerable and then we tolerate them /.
That 's why I think at some point you have to draw the line with the North Koreans /.
I do think and here I agree with both of the other gentlemen you have on the show who have shown it 's possible to reach an agreement with North Korea and to get agreements that serve our interests The much maligned agreed framework as Bob Galluci pointed out without that agreed framework North Korea by all the calculations of the experts would now have fifty nuclear weapons /.
So we were better off with the agreement than without it /.
It is possible to reach agreement with the North Koreans But not when they see the kind of footage that you uh showed Which is uh uh uh Americans drawing a line in the sand and then stepping back from that line And drawing a line in the sand and then stepping back /.
I think our diplomacy has to have carrots in it but it has to stand somewhere /.
and as I suggested earlier I think the missile tests are a good place to take a stand /.
Governor Richardson draw a line in the stand and step back /.
the North Koreans watch that /.
they observe that /.
they know what their own has been /.
How do you have any strength in negotiating with people like that /?
The North Koreans in my dealings with them they care more about form than they do substance /.
In your earlier segment you showed president Bush calling him a tyrant /.
But then later he called him Mister Kim Jong - Il /.
I was in North Korea when that happened /.
The North Koreans were delighted because they felt they 'd been treated with respect /.
They care deeply about protocol /.
And this is another reason why I think for a relatively cheap price a face to face negotiation at the level of Chris Hill who again is very competent I believe would set the stage for a final agreement at the six party talks Which is essential Which is basically a good agreement /.
In exchange for North Korea dismantling its nuclear weapons its missiles they get an armistice agreement where they are not attacked /.
they get food fuel energy assistance /.
Security assurances we will not topple their regime /.
That 's right /.
yeah that 's right /.
that 's in that September agreement that Chris Hill negotiated /.
My point is if it 's just going to be a face to face meeting that serves as a precursor that also deals with this frozen assets issue which has directly hit the North Korean regime cause it controls the foreign expenditures of Kim Jong - Il and you deal with this light water reactor especially now after we 've promised it to Iran and economic incentives to Iran I think the timing is right for this new stage of direct negotiation /.
Ambassador Galluci based on your experience do you believe the North Koreans would give up their nuclear program give up their nuclear bombs which they believe in their mind is an insurance policy against an American invasion for economic assistance light water reactors /?
At the end of the day I do n't know /.
Um but that leaves me to conclude since I really do n't know that it 's a good idea to find out /.
It 's a good idea it was in nineteen ninety four to do a deal with the North that required them to give up the program /.
We did that /.
and for a period of years we were in a position to monitor that closely /.
and they did give it up /.
Indeed you can make an argument that while the centrifuge program with the Pakistanis is clearly cheating was n't yet a genuine nuclear weapons program had n't produced anything and probably still has n't produced anything /.
So you have the possibility if the North Koreans are thinking the way they may be thinking that they need one or the other , they need either nuclear weapons to deter the United States from regime change or they need a relationship with us that makes it unnecessary for them to have nuclear weapons /.
The only way to find out whether they 'll ultimately give up those weapons is to do a deal /.
We hear so much talk about Kim Jong - Il tyrant spoiled child /.
others have said madman /.
you 've been in that country five times /.
who is he /?
What is he /?
Well I 've never met him /.
I met the number two in command /.
He is the entire nation /.
he is basically a cult of personality /.
He runs everything /.
He knows everything that 's happening /.
All power flows through him /.
Uh what that causes unfortunately is an isolated North Korea /.
His people are in terrible shape economically /.
I been there five times /.
I think I 've seen one tractor /.
I see people weak and drawn out /.
they look like they need nourishment /.
A lot of people are starving there /.
They have human rights violations /.
He is a mercurial character /.
But I think he 's crazy like a fox /.
He is not somebody that is uh out of his mind /.
he may be totally unpredictable isolated /.
but he 's calculating /.
and he 's used the Fourth of July /.
every time he feels he 's backed down he moves and does something irrational /.
Uh he shoots missiles off /.
he 's done it twice /.
He cancels agreements /.
he gets the nuclear inspectors out in two thousand and two /.
This is the way he operates /.
And what we should do is take advantage of his vulnerability /.
He also is vulnerable in the sense that the country is weak economically /.
it desperately needs an elimination of sanctions /.
they need food electricity /.
He 's realistic too I believe /.
Bill Richardson Robert Gallucci Ashton Carter thank you all for a very sobering but important discussion /.
Coming next , President Bush celebrated his sixtieth birthday this week /.
And thirty one years ago on Meet The Press then president Gerald Ford talked about being sixty and serving as president /.
Coming up right here on Meet The Press /.
And we 're back /.
Two presidential birthdays this week /.
President Bush turned sixty last Thursday /.
And this Friday former president Gerald Ford will be ninety three years old /.
Our thirty - eighth president talked about age health and the presidency right here thirty one years ago /.
Mr. President in the early days of the republic the American people took great chances on young men in the presidency /.
Now here we are looking at seventy six /.
and most of the leading candidates are old geezers like me in their sixties /.
Now we seem to have misplaced a generation here somewhere /.
is the system out of phase /.
what explains this /?
I think age is a state of mind and obviously a state of health /.
I 'm in the early sixties /.
I feel as vigorous mentally and physically as I ever have at any time in my life /.
I do n't think you should rule a person out just because they 're my particular age /.
The other hand I do n't think uh you should rule out a younger person who by experience or intelligence or overall capability is a potential candidate /.
I do n't think you should categorize people just by age bracket /.
I believe you ought to look at the person how strong he is mentally and physically what is his experience and what his background is /.
that 's the criteria I would use /.
happy birthday President Gerry Ford /.
And also happy birthday to another American legend /.
thirty eight years ago founded the special Olympics /.
She turns eighty five tomorrow /.
And we 'll be right back /.
