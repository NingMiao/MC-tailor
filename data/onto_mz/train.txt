Big Managers on Campus
In recent years , advanced education for professionals has become a hot topic in the business community .
With this trend , suddenly the mature faces of managers boasting an average of over ten years of professional experience have flooded in among the young people populating university campuses .
In order to attract this group of seasoned adults pulling in over NT$ 1 million a year back to the ivory tower , universities have begun to establish executive MBA -LRB- EMBA -RRB- programs .
In response , each year over 1000 mature professionals looking to recharge their minds and retool their know - how compete for a precious few openings in executive degree programs at top institutions such as National Taiwan University -LRB- NTU -RRB- and National Chengchi University .
What brings these accomplished business professionals back to the classroom ?
What knowledge do they seek that can not be found in society at large ?
And what effect does their return have on campus ?
Morris Chang , chairman of TSMC and a leading light of Taiwan 's high - tech industry , is the hottest university lecturer around .
Two years ago , National Chiaotung University invited Chang , one of the Taiwan IT sector 's most prominent success stories , to lecture to students in its MBA program for top managers , single - handedly raising awareness of executive MBA -LRB- EMBA -RRB- programs .
This year , Acer Group chairman Stan Shih will be a guest lecturer at the university .
The crush of business professionals fighting for a spot in the MBA program at Taiwan 's most illustrious institution of higher education - National Taiwan University - ensured that the acceptance rate for the executive graduate school was even lower than that for undergraduates taking the national university entrance examinations .
Various indications demonstrate that the " back flow education " promoted by the Ministry of Education has become the hottest investment undertaking among Taiwan 's universities .
Three years ago , in the effort to establish a greater diversity of higher educational avenues , the Ministry of Education -LRB- MOE -RRB- greatly increased the number of MA degrees open to professionals in the workforce , steadily reducing the proportion of regular students to professionals from the previous 9 - to - 1 ratio .
In addition , the MOE allowed universities to determine entrance examination topics , testing dates and times , and fee structures individually to help them find and obtain the best students .
Always in search of revenue sources , universities naturally fell right into line .
Twelve institutions opened programs in 1999 , with the number of executive degree programs growing to 34 as of this year .
And as the supply has grown , professionals looking to recharge their intellectual batteries in disciplines ranging from Chinese , foreign languages , and physics to information technology and management now have a greater selection from which to choose .
Management white - hot
A wide range of programs is available , but popularity varies greatly .
Last year , National Taiwan University of Science and Technology -LRB- NTUST -RRB- opened the doors of five of its graduate schools to professionals in the workforce .
Among them , the Institute of Fiber planned to accept 10 students , but only 20 applied , resulting in a 50 % acceptance rate ; meanwhile , the Institute of Mechanical Engineering had only 30 applicants for 10 spots .
Similarly , nine graduate institutes at NTU , including mechanical engineering , Three Principles of the People , and biology , opened degree programs to professionals last year .
Expecting to accept 167 students , they attracted a mere 330 - combined applicants .
Compared to the lukewarm popularity of other graduate programs , management institutes are white hot .
The NTUST College of Management attracted nearly 500 applicants with over 10 years of work experience for 20 spots in its executive management program beginning in 1999 .
NTU 's College of Management opened its doors to 44 professionals on a trial basis in 1996 , attracting a phenomenal 990 applicants .
When 95 spots were offered the following year , the number of applicants rose again to 1400 .
Currently , around a dozen public and private universities in Taiwan , including NTU , National Chiaotung University , National Sun Yat - sen University , Da - Yeh Institute of Technology , and Yuan - Ze Institute of Technology , offer advanced degree programs for executive management personnel .
What is it that makes graduate programs in management so popular among the working population ?
Liao Ching - jong , director of the NTUST College of Management , relates that new entrants into the professional ranks concentrate on accumulating professional know - how , while seasoned middle - and top - level executives seek an edge in management .
And while most recent university graduates are able to apply professional know - how upon entering the work force , one is not necessarily taught management in the workplace .
Hence universities are the place for systematic instruction on management .
" Given the speed at which the business environment is changing , many new concepts were not previously taught , " says Wu Se - hwa , dean of National Chengchi University 's College of Commerce .
Wu notes that such new fields as venture capital , technology management , intellectual property , and e-commerce are all recent additions to the curriculum over the past few years .
Professor Tang Ming - je of NTU 's College of Management adds : " With small , medium - size and family businesses forming the backbone of Taiwanese industry , one could do just fine without professional management .
But in the age of the global village , many bosses are finding that relying on ' instinct ' to make business decisions is not enough , and that they need systematic management concepts . "
Other management experts note that once Taiwan joins the World Trade Organization -LRB- WTO -RRB- , foreign universities will be able to recruit students directly in Taiwan , and that with the Ministry of Education asking national universities to come up with a portion of their own funding , universities are doubly motivated to establish programs of this sort .
NTU , which enjoys the distinction of being Taiwan 's premier institution of higher education , " never lacks for students , because there are always people who want to attend NTU , " says Tang Ming - je .
More than a diploma
In order to accommodate professionals with day jobs , many universities have scheduled their business management courses during evening hours .
The sight of professionals in suits and ties rushing to class at dusk contrasts greatly from the typical jeans and casual attire of fresh - faced undergrads .
Shuttling between the office and the campus , do they ever feel like they 're burning the candle at both ends ?
At some schools , even professionals boasting Ph.D. degrees are coming back to school for Master 's degrees .
Is the degree really that important to them ?
Mouton Lee , in charge of over 80 employees and production of key components as president of ABBA Linear Tech Co. , Ltd. , is a second - year student in the NTUST Graduate School of Management .
Lee relates that as a youth he studied because he was forced to , but now his motivations for learning are far greater - so great in fact that he registered for three classes at the start of the semester , a decision he has come to regret for lack of time .
Lee , who has also taken short - term management courses , says , " Degree programs are better , since the pressure makes you grow . "
Mouton Lee would like a Master 's degree , yet today he studies for the knowledge it brings .
Ever since graduating with a degree in mechanical engineering from NTUST and setting out to start his own business over 20 years ago , that degree has sat in a drawer somewhere , relegated to mere symbolic significance .
Hsieh Sun - chi , director of the Control Yuan 's Office of Information Management and a 25 - year veteran of civil service , relates that he has already attained the highest rank a general civil servant can achieve , yet at the age of 50 he still has over a decade until retirement .
Two years ago , this led him to consider taking a new direction , and he tested into National Chengchi University 's College of Commerce intent on making connections with movers and shakers in different fields .
Chang Chin - tsung , a researcher at the Chung - Shan Institute of Science & Technology with a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from a US university , shuttles between his office in Taoyuan s Lungtan and the NTU campus three days each week .
Long immersed in the sciences and always focusing on numbers and statistics , Chang says he feels like he " has gotten into a mental rut . "
Although Hsinchu 's National Chiaotung University offers a similar management curriculum , he was concerned that the students there would be science park types with similar backgrounds in high tech fields .
Thus he would rather spend the extra time commuting to NTU to be around students with experience in such fields as advertising , finance , and architecture .
" I 'd be lying if I said the degree does n't matter .
If it did n't , why not just get into a non-degree program ?
The truth is that a degree in management does nothing to help me in my current job , but it gives me a second skill if I choose another route in the future . "
Advanced training for professionals has become a hot topic among executives over the past two years , but continuing education is nothing new among Taiwan 's universities .
For instance , National Chengchi University 's Public Administration Center has offered graduate extension courses for executives for over a decade , the difference being that , upon completion of the curriculum students only receive a certificate of course credit .
In comparison , a Master 's degree is far more appealing , given that a degree is awarded upon completion of studies .
Burning the proverbial candle
Motivated by the degree or not , the enthusiasm of these professionals for their studies is impressive .
Nevertheless , they must pay a hefty price to be able to study in the first place .
First , working during the day and attending classes at night is often a war of energy and will .
Next , they must shuffle their work schedules to accommodate their studies .
Many of them have to reschedule business trips .
Meanwhile , some become highway speeders , rushing from Taoyuan or Hsinchu to attend class .
And female managers , ordinarily responsible for household chores as well , really burn the proverbial candle at both ends .
" I have my time perfectly allotted , " says Morna Lee , Taiwan regional business manager for Kellogg 's .
She divides her schedule into three - month cycles , and with one class on Thursday afternoons , her company does its best to accommodate her by not holding meetings that involve her on that day of the week .
Still , sometimes nothing can be done , such as the time that she had a meeting in Hong Kong early one Friday morning , forcing her to miss class on Thursday while she flew to Hong Kong .
She had to fly quickly back to Taipei to make class on Saturday afternoon .
Despite often staying up until 2:00 or 3:00 AM to study or write reports , Lee likes mingling in the executive management class with a diverse group of students from different fields , and feels that the new ideas the professors feed them help keep her brain supple .
Moreover , she muses , " We managers are a strange breed .
If we do n't exhaust ourselves , we end up sick . "
Female professionals like Morna Lee represent a minority among executive degree students , accounting for just about five percent .
" If you asked me whether work or family is more important , I would say that since entering society 20 years ago work has always come first , " states Donna Sun , vice president of the Human Resource Division at Schmidt Scientific Taiwan .
Even if she has no classes to attend , leaving the office at 8:00 PM is no different from the perspective of her family life than the extra hour she spends attending classes until 9:00 PM .
She is thankful that her son , a university student , and her daughter , a third - year junior high school student , have always been very independent and self - reliant .
Hiring someone to help with housework , Lee is a model for the children when it comes to studying , even taking them to the library on breaks to conduct research .
No magic bullet
Compared to young students focused on getting a degree , the motivations of professionals studying for advanced degrees " are not that simple . "
They might be after new knowledge , keen to sport a fancy degree from a graduate school like NTU or Chengchi University , out to network with others , or looking out for the survival of business and to raise competitiveness by searching for answers to difficult work or business issues .
" Looking for quick answers from professors is a misguided concept , " says Tang Ming - je , professor of strategic management at NTU 's Department of International Business .
Before commencing a course , Tang tells his students , " I am not in the consulting business .
There are no magic bullets , for if I had any I 'd have gotten rich long ago . "
Wu Se - hwa , dean of National Chengchi University 's College of Commerce , relates , " Academic institutions provide systematic thinking , not the answers to specific questions . "
Wu tells his students that if they put other things aside and concentrate on their studies for three weeks , maybe they 'll find the answer themselves .
Wu notes that adult students bring rich practical experience to the table , and lack only the knowledge to combine and integrate scattered experience .
For them , returning to school is valuable for establishing their own modes of thinking with the knowledge they pick up .
Unlike the 20th century , where the amount of capital was the greatest factor determining success , Wu Se - hwa believes that the next century will be about " knowledge as the main competitive force . "
The book The 500 - year Delta notes that in the 1960s each executive might only have to learn one new skill each year , such as how to use a computer or send e-mail .
By the 1990s , accumulation of know - how accelerated many times over , so that executives needed to learn something new each day .
Now , in the 21st century , each manager might have to learn something new every single hour of the working day .
Curriculums need selling points
In order to satisfy students with diverse expectations and needs for basic knowledge , what innovative means must a professor resort to ?
And what challenges does this pose for the institution itself ?
People are going to fall asleep no matter what , so you have to think on your feet and use different techniques to stimulate their attention , " remarks Mark Gia - khy Tang , professor in the Department of Risk Management and Insurance at National Chengchi University .
Students who have been away from the classroom for well over a decade can not be expected to remember all the formulas they learned in statistics and economics classes way back when .
Nor should classes turn into solo performances by the professor .
Professor Tang 's approach is to lecture on theory for the first hour , then use the remaining time on the homework that each group worked on since the previous week .
Tang 's own " Three No's " policy guides his teaching approach : No midterms , no final exams , and no calling on students .
Instead , grades are based on homework results and class participation .
Tang 's risk management class is discussing how to identify risks .
One of the questions is : " If there were a fairy who could spell out for you exactly what you would experience for the rest of your life , consider what advantages and disadvantages the following information might have for you .
For instance , no matter how hard you work , you are still fated to be poor all your life .
Or what if you were fated to have everything go your way ?
What if , for example , you 're going to be elected to the legislature , or become the president ? "
Tom Lin , associate professor of marketing at NTUST , describes the main difference between teaching adult executives and regular students :
" Executives are always asking questions .
Even when they have an idea themselves , they 'll still bring up issues they encountered in their jobs to see how you respond . "
Often , says Lin , such questions leave him stumped .
Another issue for adult students always on the run is their unfamiliarity with the campus .
In order to enhance their sense of identification with the school , NTUST designed an overseas business camp program .
Last year , one professor made a big hit with over 30 students , taking them to mainland China for over ten days to familiarize them with the investment environment there .
This year , trips are planned to Japan and Silicon Valley in the United States .
Planting in fertile soil
Judging from the manner in which universities are opening their doors for continuing education , non-degree programs , and professional training , higher education in Taiwan appears to be undergoing a sort of makeover .
With these changes , universities must not only take care of teaching and research , but must also make sure they play their third function properly - spreading knowledge and sharing it with the public .
Still , detractors point out that university graduate programs for business executives appear to be elitist .
One student attending a non-degree program at NTUST relates that there are not enough spots to go around in the executive degree programs .
Hoping to make the switch from the non-degree program , he failed to pass the screening that is administered prior to the admissions test .
" If you fail a test , you only have yourself to blame , but tripping up on the initial screening is just a matter of not having a high enough job title . "
Each year when EMBA program acceptances are released , newspapers carry letters from readers relating how certain national university graduate schools compete to accept CEOs and presidents of listed corporations , or the children of rich business people .
The NTUST student expresses cynicism toward the application and review process , suspecting that " they just pay attention to company name and job title . "
Moreover , continuing education courses charge hefty tuition fees .
For instance , NTU divides the school year into three semesters , at NT$ 50,000 per semester , while other institutions charge between NT$ 3700 and $ 10,000 per credit , a full two to three times more than regular graduate student tuition .
Such instances naturally lead to suspicion that graduate schools such as these are " out to make a killing " by catering only to an elite few .
" From review , to written test , to oral exam , in order to ensure fairness , no professor is involved in more than one portion of the process , " says Huang Chung - hsing , director of the EMBA program at NTU .
Still , Huang admits that the bigger the company and higher the candidate 's job title , the greater their chances of acceptance into the program .
This can be partially attributed to the belief among professors that the commitment of their educational resources yields " more bang for the buck . "
As Tang Ming - je forthrightly explains , university professors ' time is a national resource , and if they can have a positive impact on an executive controlling budgets of billions of NT dollars , their contribution to country and society is considerable .
Asks Liao Ching - jong , director of the NTUST Graduate School of Management , concurs , " Which is greater , the marginal benefit of a company president or a staff member 's education ?
The president can go back and put what she learns into practice right away . "
What is more , even if schools do not deliberately seek out company presidents , they invariably perform better on oral exams - perhaps due to their greater experience .
" We must ask ourselves some questions , too , when EMBAs are thought of as giving away degrees to the privileged few , " comments Wu Se - Hwa .
Wu tells his professors that unless they perform well in class , the EMBA can not develop further , as universities are founded upon academic research .
As for tuition policies , Wu Se - Hwa relates that with an annual budget of NT$ 2.1 billion , National Chengchi University spends about NT$ 200,000 per student .
Thus , when it comes down to calculating costs , NT$ 10,000 per credit is actually quite cheap .
Industry retooling
The EMBA craze reflects the cold , intense competition of social Darwinism , but does it also signify that Taiwanese industry is beginning to devote greater attention to the training of top executives ?
Many scholars believe that with the EMBA phenomenon just getting off its feet in Taiwan , many corporate bosses are taking a " wait - and - see " attitude .
This is reflected in the way students approach the programs , not informing their bosses that they have applied to a program until they have been accepted , and not occupying work time if school takes place in the evening .
This way , their boss 's attitude has no particular bearing on what they do .
Perhaps business education may not be widespread in Taiwan at this time , yet a small number of company bosses have taken the lead themselves - taking advanced courses and setting an example for management personnel .
Ma Yu - shan , chairman of Kingdom Construction and 64 years old this year , tested into NTU 's College of Management in 1998 , becoming NTU 's oldest student .
For Ma , " living and learning " is more than just a maxim , as each year Kingdom Construction employees are required to undergo 80 hours of on - the - job training .
" For the boss to lead his team , he ca n't just tell his subordinates to learn , while he remains static himself .
Not to mention that in discussions with employees , if they know you 're the kind of boss who does n't seek to further himself , they put less stock in what you say , " notes Ma .
With the rapid changes in the business environment , poor decision - making can have serious consequences for company development .
" The pressure on the boss is tremendous , because nobody comes to the CEO with easy questions . "
Too busy to attend regular courses , Ma Yu - shan took the advice of an NTU professor and hired a Ph.D. student to tutor him one semester in " management economics . "
Amber Huang , president of Changhua 's Feng Huei Steel & Iron Company , is a student in the Department of Business Administration at NTUST .
Huang notes three advantages of the boss going to school .
First , it 's good for his company 's image .
As his company must frequently seek bank loans , Huang asks rhetorically , " Could a studious boss be a bad guy ? "
This image has helped him secure loans with little difficulty every time .
Second , it sets a good example for employees .
Lastly , speaking the professional lingo fluently helps enhance his authority .
Knowledge for the new century
In the effort to cultivate management talent , many prominent multinational corporations have founded their own teaching institutions , Toyota University and Intel University being two good examples .
In Taiwan , the Acer Group 's Aspire Academy opened its doors in Lungtan -LRB- Taoyuan Country -RRB- last October after three years of planning .
During the Aspire Academy opening ceremony , academy president Stan Shih , chairman of the Acer Group , remarked that he hopes to introduce management models from Europe and America and mesh them with the unique attributes of Taiwanese industry to enhance the globalization of Asian business .
Shih noted that through the sharing of experiences , emerging businesses might save themselves a lot of groping in the dark .
Are people at the fin de siecle inspired to learn by the confluence of technology , humanities , and economic knowledge ?
At least the entrepreneurs , managers , and executives in campuses around Taiwan clearly recognize that learning is a necessity for survival and an engine of growth .
Everyday People and A Story of True Grit --
The Wu Family of Taihsi
-LRB- Laura Li / photos by Hsueh Chi - kuang / tr. by David Mayer -RRB-
They say a rising tide lifts all boats .
No one would know more about that than the older generation in Taiwan .
The changes of the past five decades have had a deep impact , for example , on the Wu family of Yunlin County .
Their main claim to fame is ... nothing , actually , and that is precisely why their story typifies the experiences of so many .
So lend your attention , dear reader , as we recount the ups and downs of an average family from a quiet little backwater called Taihsi Township .
Wu Tsung - sheng and his older sister have come to meet me at the train station in Touliu , administrative seat of Yunlin County .
We pile into a car and head toward their parents ' home .
Wu Tsung - sheng fills me in on his hometown .
" Taihsi is a rather unusual place , " says Tsung - sheng , the family 's oldest grandson and a doctoral candidate in sociology at Tunghai University in Taichung .
" When I read the studies that describe Taiwan as being so prosperous , I have to wonder how their descriptions could be so totally different from what our lives have been .
They might as well be talking about a different planet . "
Probably most people do n't realize , adds Tsung - sheng , that there are still places in Taiwan as backward as Taihsi .
To the outsider , however , the place does n't look backward at all .
As Tsung - sheng drives west in a very nice Toyota at a comfortable speed down a broad county highway , his older sister sits in the front passenger seat with cell phone in hand discussing the traffic situation with someone at home .
In the meantime , Tsung - sheng 's five - year - old nephew clamors from the back seat for his mother to buy him a Pokemon plaything , just like kids the world over are doing these days .
When McDonald 's stores in Taiwan were swamped last year during a giveaway of Hello Kitty dolls , lots of people thought they might be able to beat the crowds by hitting McDonald 's in supposedly untrendy Taihsi , but they found the lines there every bit as long as in more urban locations .
The emperor is far away
The scenery grows increasingly rural as we move west through the townships of Huwei , Tuku , Paochung , and Tungshih .
Temples tower over green rice fields .
Less than half an hour after leaving the train station we get off the county highway and onto narrow Tungshih East Road .
When we reach our destination in rural Taihsi Township , a few dozen buildings of modern ferroconcrete construction line the road , and shops of every description occupy the ground floor of each one .
Wu Tsung - sheng 's parents , who are pushing 60 years old , run a local bakery , and they greet us with the wide smiles and warm hospitality so typical of haikou -LRB- as the locals are accustomed to calling Taihsi and the surrounding townships near the coast in western Yunlin County -RRB- .
They also speak Taiwanese with an unmistakable haikou accent .
To welcome their guest they have ordered a big seafood meal in advance .
Tsung - sheng 's grandmother , parents , uncles , aunts , cousins , nephews , and nieces have all come in from around haikou for the gathering .
The strength of the Wu clan 's family ties is plainly evident .
These people go back for generations here .
From the destruction of World War II to the mixed joy and grief of the early post-war years , from the barest of rural hamlets to a prosperous little town , this family has seen it all .
84 - year - old grandma Wu is not as sharp as she used to be , but she can still rattle off a tale or two .
Two indignities suffered back in the 1940s , in particular , remain indelibly etched in her memory .
The first occurred in the latter part of World War II when the Japanese tied her hands behind her back and marched her off to do forced labor for over a year , building roads , digging ditches , and carrying a shoulder pole .
The second indignity was the onerous taxes that were levied in the early years after Taiwan returned to Chinese rule .
" We had to pay taxes twice a year , " says grandma Wu , flashing a mouthful of dental work .
" The first time was for water , and the second was for land .
It did n't matter whether you even had a crop to harvest or not - you had to pay , or they 'd throw you in jail . "
She explains that one dou -LRB- 10 liters -RRB- of rice back in the 1940s was worth five or six yuan , or about four days ' pay for a manual laborer , but the tax on one jia of land -LRB- 0.97 hectares -RRB- was 150 yuan .
A lot of people had to borrow money just to pay their taxes .
" It took four days to earn one dou of rice , " says grandma Wu .
" We could n't afford to eat it , because we needed it to pay our taxes . "
Although the Kuomintang government eventually carried out land reform to provide relief for poor farmers , the Wu family never shared in the benefits .
They were as poor as their neighbors , to be sure , but they owned land and were thus classified as small landowners , which by definition meant that they neither had any extra land to rent out nor did they rent from others .
While many of their neighbors received land as a result of the reforms , the Wu family got nothing .
Grandma Wu was close to 30 years old when the Kuomintang recovered Taiwan from Japan , but the event meant little to her , for she had never received any schooling .
All she remembers is that when the war ended , Taiwan was turned over to " them . "
With a grin , grandma Wu throws up her hands in a gesture of helplessness and quips , " When the colonial government spoke , I did n't understand their Japanese .
When the Kuomintang speaks , I do n't understand their Mandarin either . "
" There 's no difference between the Japanese government and the Kuomintang , " says Grandma Wu .
" If something important comes up , they send a local official out to make an announcement and explain what it 's all about . "
Wu Tsung - sheng adds , " They 're totally outside the loop here .
You of course know the phrase , ' Heaven is high and the emperor is far away . '
Well , it was people like my grandmother who coined it . "
Grandma Wu was adopted into the Wu family at age ten .
Within half a year both of her adoptive parents died , and at age 11 she slipped and fell in the sugar cane fields , poking her left eye out .
Orphaned and blind in one eye , a hard life lay in store for her , but she made the best of a bad situation .
With no male siblings to carry on the family line , at age 25 she managed to find a husband who was willing to let his first male child take the Wu surname .
The children came rapidly , and there was never any money to spare .
But it is clear that she does live reasonably well now .
When did survival cease to be such a struggle ?
Grandma Wu remembers quite clearly when the turning point came .
It was in the early 1980s , when her oldest grandchild was already a teenager , that business gradually started going better for her three sons .
The three brothers got together and decided that they should each give her NT$ 2,000 every month .
For the first time in her life , she was able to relax a bit , then five years ago the government started providing a monthly pension of NT$ 3,000 .
This was enough to cover meals , and her life improved even more .
Grandma Wu now lives together with several other old folks very near the coast in the old traditional farmhouse where she grew up .
Her main worry these days is her granddaughter in Taipei , who is in her 30s and still unmarried .
" Her father got married when he was 22 .
How can a girl be putting things off ? "
13 - year - old construction worker
A lot of hard work has gone into the comfortable life Grandma Wu enjoys today .
Her eldest son Wu Chien - lo recounts that after he graduated from sixth grade in 1954 his family was too poor to let him go any further in school , so at age 13 he took off with an older boy on the slow train for Taipei .
Without pausing to take in the sights of the big city , Chien - lo went straight to work at a construction site , where he carried a shoulder pole and mixed cement .
Buildings were going up everywhere in Taipei in the mid-1950s , and the city was bursting with opportunities .
But , says Chien - lo , " I only had a grade - school education .
I did n't have what it took to think about a career in Taipei .
I just wanted to go back and help my family work the fields . "
After two years in Taipei he went back home just as the area was getting electric power for the first time .
The bright lights at night got some people so excited at first that they could n't get to sleep .
Taiwan back then was one of the world s biggest producers of sugar cane , but the harvest was extremely difficult work , as Chien - lo is painfully aware .
Once he came very close to cutting a finger clean off with a sickle , but he just slapped some cement mix -LRB- commonly regarded as a good disinfectant -RRB- on the wound and worked on through the pain .
United we stand
Wu Chien - lo joined the army at age 20 , and during his stint he made friends with someone who had been making a living as a baker .
Chien - lo began to realize that selling his manual labor was not a viable long - term option .
He decided to open a bakery .
After receiving his discharge he borrowed NT$ 12,000 from his father , hired a baker , and opened up a store .
He himself rode around on a motorcycle all day selling beverages and baked goods .
His capital ran out before he expected , and he had to ask for a second loan from his father - in - law to get his business off the ground .
A few years later his younger brother Tsai Jui - ting -LRB- as the second son , he was given his father 's surname -RRB- got married and followed in Wu Chien - lo 's footsteps by selling baked goods and beverages .
To avoid competing with his brother , Jui - ting opened up his store over ten kilometers north in Mailiao Township .
Jui - ting , who in his youth always wore hand - me - downs and crude garments fashioned from throwaway rice sacks and the like , never put on his own set of store - bought clothes until just prior to joining the army .
Who would have guessed he would one day become the biggest beverage wholesaler in the Mailiao area ?
Having watched his older brothers succeed with their bakery businesses , the youngest brother Tsai Kuo - lung took up the same business in the neighboring township of Szuhu after finishing his military service .
The three brothers have worked together over the years to build up their businesses , and an efficient division of labor has evolved among them .
Kuo - lung today is in charge of doing all the baking , and he acts as supplier for Wu Chien - lo and Tsai Jui - ting .
" In a rural area like this , " says Wu Chien - lo , " family members work together , and everybody shares equally in the success . "
Not surprisingly , of course , he has seen quarrels arise in other families over who does the most work and who goofs off , who 's getting rich and who 's not , but in the Wu family , at least , harmony has been the key to success .
All three brothers are hard - working and frugal .
Each one married through a matchmaker , and none of them ever had an album of wedding photos made .
Asks Tsai Kuo - lung , " Why should we work so hard and pinch pennies all the time just to spend our money on something like that ? "
All three brothers drive Toyota Camrys , purchased from the same dealer .
One can gradually save up money by running a small business , to be sure , but Wu Chien - lo states frankly , " Land is where the real money is .
It 's hard to get by just running a business . "
Because his beverage wholesaling business requires a lot of space for large warehouses , he borrowed money from friends for many years to buy land .
Little did he know when he first started that what he bought 30 years ago would go up in price from NT$ 3,000 per ping -LRB- approximately 3.3 square meters -RRB- to over NT$ 100,000 today .
When you throw in the family farmland , which has not yet been divided among the brothers , the Wu clan is worth over NT$ 100 million .
Says Wu Chien - lo , " Who figured prices would go up like they have ?
We did n't buy the land as an investment .
We 're not greedy enough to even think in those terms .
We just bought it because we needed it for our business . "
Sacrificing for the kids
Although they may be loath to spend frivolously on themselves , Wu Chien - lo and his wife consider money no object when it comes to their children 's education .
" The reason we worked so hard around the clock for so many years was because we were afraid that we might not be able to do right by our kids .
We were worried that they might fall in with the wrong crowd after they got into junior high , " says Mrs. Wu , adding that Taihsi is well known for the fact that it has " lots of dust in the air , lots of yams , and lots of gangsters . "
To keep their kids out of trouble they sent all four of them off to a well - known Catholic boarding school in Touliu as soon as they reached junior high .
Each child spent six years there -LRB- except for the second daughter , who only attended for three years -RRB- , and every weekend the two parents would pack up lots of goodies and take the bus to see their kids .
It was a difficult trip , and required several transfers .
The total cost of one year 's tuition plus room and board at the private school came to more than NT$ 150,000 per child .
With four kids at the school , the financial burden was substantial , especially considering the fact that they were spending these sums back in the mid-1980s .
The struggle to pay tuition took every ounce of energy they had .
" That 's the responsibility you bear as a parent .
You want to see your children succeed , " says Wu Chien - lo .
Luckily , all four of his children were good students and had no problem passing their university entrance examinations .
In their little hometown , Wu Tsung - sheng and his siblings are noted for their excellent academic achievements .
The result has been a bit comical in at least one respect , for the eldest daughter was so strictly observant of the prohibition against speaking Taiwanese in school -LRB- a rule formerly enforced throughout Taiwan -RRB- that she does n't even speak Taiwanese very well any more .
After graduating from National Taiwan Normal University in Taipei , she came back to Yunlin County several years ago to teach senior high school in Touliu , and now she makes people laugh every time she opens her mouth to speak her odd brand of Taiwanese .
It makes for an amusing contrast with her grandmother , who does n't speak Mandarin well at all .
In the view of Wu Tsung - sheng , the heavy emphasis that rural parents put on education does n't have so much to do with the idea of getting ahead , but stems mainly from a deep respect for learning .
His parents are not interested in his specialty , nor do they know anything about it , but they have never objected to his chosen path , nor did they say a word when his younger brother switched his major from business management to sociology .
This long leash is all the more impressive in view of the fact that there is no chance that either of these sociology majors will ever be able to make a living near home -LRB- because there are no major universities or research institutions in Yunlin County -RRB- .
" Thinking back on it , I realize that our parents began encouraging us very early to aim high and not feel like we had to stay near home .
We all started boarding school at age twelve and then went on to university in Taipei .
As we got older , we went back home less and less . "
Their studies ended up weakening their ties to their hometown , notes Tsung - sheng wistfully .
Their parents , in the meantime , are doing everything they can to make it easier for the children to come back home if necessary .
For starters , they 've built a multi-story house with a separate floor set aside for each of the children .
Chien - lo explains , " Our two boys have n't started working or gotten married yet .
I hope they 'll be able to make a go of it off in some city , but if it does n't work out they can always come back and tend the store . "
It would probably make better business sense , in fact , to close the store .
People have been moving away from the haikou area for many years , and the local economy is in the doldrums .
What 's more , it will only get more and more difficult to make money running an old - fashioned mom and pop store now that a new convenience store has opened up across the street .
Even so , the couple is n't yet ready to call it quits .
It is for their children 's sake that they stay in business .
Living next to heavy industry
Less than ten kilometers away in Mailiao stands the Formosa Plastic Group 's sixth naphtha cracker complex .
Tsai Jui - ting points out that even though Formosa Plastics uses a lot of foreign laborers from southeast Asia , the complex has also hired a lot of local people , and since the plant went into operation he does n't seem to see so many young people hanging out in the area 's small towns with nothing to do .
Even though the seawall built to protect the plant has blocked people 's view of the sea , and in spite of worries about the possibility of mercury pollution in the soil , the extra employment has won the plant a lot of local support .
Says Wu Chien - lo , " I always say , if you 've got work , you 've got food on the table .
Do n't go around complaining about the pay being too low .
It used to take four days to earn one dou of rice .
Now you can earn over ten dou in just one day .
If that 's not enough for you , then you might as well go starve to death . "
Wu Chien - lo and his younger brothers do n't expect a lot from the government .
At most , they express nostalgia for the days when former general Hau Pei - tsun served as premier , because " they arrested a lot of criminals when he was in charge . "
The one thing that really irks them now is national health insurance .
" When you run your own business like we do , " says youngest brother Tsai Kuo - lung , " a family of five like ours has to pay over NT$ 60,000 per year in premiums for national health insurance .
That 's a lot more expensive than labor insurance or farmer 's insurance .
What 's more , he adds , there are no major hospitals in Yunlin County , so if you get sick you 've got to go all the way to the next county .
Not only that , says Tsai , the deductible for medicine was jacked up " ridiculously high " last year , and everyone is complaining bitterly about it .
Hoping for more democracy
When the subject turns to politics and Taiwan independence , the normally outspoken Wu Chien - lo suddenly grows cautious .
" It does n't matter who wins the election .
They 're all good candidates .
We 'll just have to wait and see . "
Wu Tsung - sheng understands the reasons for his father 's reticence quite well .
Yunlin County politics are riddled with factionalism and the influence of organized crime , and you can find ample proof here that all politics are indeed local .
With over 40 voters in the extended family , the Wu clan is a plum of a voting block .
All the local factions eagerly woo Chien - lo , who has in the past gotten deeply involved in politics and taken to the streets in support of certain candidates .
Over the years , however , he has learned that it is best to avoid offending people , and he now plays his cards close to the vest .
Wu Tsung - sheng explains that local politics in the haikou area are linked only tenuously to what goes on in distant Taipei , and the concept of democracy has n't made much headway here .
The locals are most concerned about what public figure " gives people face " by showing up at weddings and funerals , and who has close personal ties with whom .
What is more , vote buying is accepted with breezy indifference , as if it were the normal thing to do .
However , says Tsung - sheng , local politics probably wo n't be so dirty once the younger generation becomes more influential .
Fifty years of struggle have brought prosperity to our island .
Will it take another fifty years to establish a mature democracy ?
As Tsung - sheng drives down the road , holding forth on politics and society , I ca n't help feeling all of a sudden that there is every reason to be very confident about the future of Taiwan .

Taiwan Toils with Double Trouble -- Forest Fires Burn and Oil Spill Bubbles
-LRB- Chang Chin - ju / tr. by David Mayer -RRB-
With the ruling and opposition parties slugging it out over the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant , a cargo ship ran quietly aground in mid-January just offshore from the Lungkeng Ecological Protection Area in Kenting National Park .
Preliminary containment of the resulting oil spill was not achieved until late February .
In the meantime , Taiwan has been hit by a rash of forest fires .
Clearly , the activities of man are becoming increasingly destructive of nature .
Can we expect to go on forever wreaking havoc on the earth without inviting a backlash from Mother Nature ?
The armed forces dispatched thousands of soldiers to deal with the oil spill at Lungkeng , located at the southern tip of Taiwan , and the first phase of the cleanup was completed on February 16 with the removal of over 300 tons of oil from the shore .
The second phase entails cleaning the uplifted coral seashore and restoring the environment of the intertidal zone .
The problem is that efforts to clean up the oil could cause great damage to the complex ecology of the coral shoreline and destroy the beauty of the intertidal zone .
How to go about undoing the environmental destruction that has already occurred ?
Due to a lack of comprehensive studies , the local environment in Lungkeng is not sufficiently understood .
With scholars still in the midst of research , it has been impossible to take concrete action .
The oil spill occurred at about 5 p.m. on January 14 when the Greek freighter MV Amorgos carrying ore from India to the port of Nantong in mainland China ran aground about a kilometer off the cape at Oluanpi .
A thousand tons of fuel oil began pouring through the ship 's torn hull .
The disaster has hit the uplifted coral at Lungkeng the hardest .
The ocean waves brought the oil to shore , making a mess of the beautiful coral coastline , slathering shellfish and aquatic plants , and filling the air with a petroleum stench .
Taiwanese society , caught up in the furor over the nuclear power plant up north , took little immediate notice of the accident .
The shipowner did n't stop up the leaking hull of the MV Amorgos until the end of January .
He went through a shipping agent in Taiwan to hire local residents in Lungkeng to clean up the shoreline , but the oil slick had mucked up a three - kilometer stretch of strikingly beautiful blue waters , throwing a pall over the local tourism and fishing industries .
After days of bitter complaints , aggrieved residents finally got the attention of the news media .
On February 7 , three weeks after the spill , the Environmental Protection Administration formed an emergency task force , and EPA chief Edgar Lin headed south to inspect the site .
On February 10 , Premier Chang Chun - hsiung and several other high - ranking government officials boarded a military helicopter for an aerial survey of the spill , and the premier instructed the Ministry of Transportation and Communications and the Ministry of National Defense to get the oil cleaned up within 30 working days .
The EPA worked up an estimate of the cost of cleanup , ship removal , and reparations to fishermen , and notified both the shipowner and the insurance company .
The ship 's captain and other ship officers had to post bond before they were allowed to leave Taiwan .
In addition to these emergency measures , the EPA has also been working to draft : -LRB- 1 -RRB- a set of guidelines for establishing task forces to deal with major maritime environmental disasters ; and -LRB- 2 -RRB- an emergency response plan for maritime oil spills .
Draft versions of both these documents will be presented to the cabinet as soon as possible .
The cabinet will request the Legislative Yuan to authorize an extraordinary budget allocation to cover the purchase of oil containment booms , sorbents , helicopters , and other equipment needed for responding to oil spills .
The problem , however , is that authorities did not respond in the critical first few hours and days following the spill .
This failure focused renewed attention on poor coordination between the central and local governments .
In a public opinion poll , nearly 70 % of respondents indicated dissatisfaction with the government 's handling of the oil spill .
With today 's huge volume of international shipping , oil spills are becoming a serious problem .
Although the recent spill in Taiwan was small in comparison with 10,000 - ton spills that have occurred elsewhere , the situation here is worrisome because , as a petroleum importer , oil tankers ply the waters around our island in swarms .
There is no telling when the next spill might happen .
While acknowledging the necessity of drafting emergency response plans , academics argue that an even more pressing task facing the government is to catalog Taiwan 's marine resources .
Otherwise , they say , it may be impossible to press reparation claims against shipping companies that accurately reflect the extent of damages .
The lack of a detailed understanding of the Lungkeng ecology presents a perfect case in point .
Similarly , after the recent spate of forest fires in central and southern Taiwan , scholars have again reacted by calling on the government to begin as soon as possible with ongoing studies of Taiwan 's forest habitats .
Investigations have shown that most of the recent forest fires plaguing Taiwan have been caused by campfires .
Although the recent fires have been put out fairly quickly , a blaze on Snow Mountain caused alarm when it burned near a stand of rare Chinese hemlock as well as streams that are home to the Formosan landlocked salmon , which is regarded as a national treasure .
Forestry service officials indicate that none of the recent blazes has caused major damage , but the Council of Agriculture has instructed the various forestry districts to step up patrols to keep man - made forest fires from happening again and again .
Chao Jung - tai , a researcher at Taiwan Forestry Research Institute , feels that the public ought to take the forest fires and the oil spill in Lungkeng as warnings of the urgent need to understand the environment in which we live .
For example , Chao asks : What are the scientific criteria for deciding when a forest fire has caused enough damage to require rehabilitation of the environment afterwards ?
Under what circumstances is it okay to let the environment recover on its own ?
These questions require ongoing monitoring and research before objective criteria can be developed and environmental rehabilitation efforts can be carried out properly .
Once an environment that has taken shape over millions of years is destroyed , it is usually beyond man 's ability to undo the damage .
Efforts to that end often prove fruitless .
It is time to start devoting serious thought to the question of how to preserve the beauty of the island we call home .

Superstore Consumer Culture
-LRB- Teng Sue - feng / photos by Jimmy Lin / tr. by Jonathan Barnard -RRB-
Yet another superstore chain has come to Taiwan .
On December 9 , the British firm Tesco said hello to consumers in Taiwan when it formally opened its clean , bright and spacious store .
There are now about 100 retailers in Taiwan with individual stores of at least several thousand ping -LRB- a ping equals 36 square feet -RRB- .
With the full adoption of two - day weekends every other week , people in Taiwan have had to figure out what to do with these new days off .
Visiting superstores - with their ample parking , restaurants and piles of consumer goods - has become a major leisure - time activity .
What kind of social changes does Taiwan 's consumer behavior reflect ?
Is densely populated Taiwan well suited to absorb all these stores , which are sprouting up like mushrooms after a rain ?
Waves of traffic are heading out from Taipei toward the suburbs , toward the open expanses in the riverbed area of Neihu .
Once the cars pass the Minchuan or the Second Macarthur Bridge , the landscape becomes dotted with the large signs of major retailers .
These include Costco , the third largest superstore retailer in the United States ; B&Q , the largest do - it - yourself hardware chain in Britain ; and Taiwan 's own RT - Mart .
Shopping at these large stores has quickly become a part of leisure - time life in Taiwan .
A Mrs. Chao , who lives in Neihu , explains that on weekends or vacation days the whole family sleeps late .
Once they are up , if there 's nothing special on the agenda , they go to B&Q to look at stuff for the home .
Then when they get tired , they go to Costco for some Pizza or muffins .
Finally , they end up in RT - Mart , where they buy groceries .
The whole trip takes about half the day .
She had thought that these stores were only crowded on the weekends , but on a rainy weekday in November she decided she did n't feel like cooking and went to buy some prepared foods at the RT - Mart 's deli department .
She discovered that there was n't a single open parking space among the hundreds on the first and second floors of the parking structure .
She was quite surprised to find that business was so good on a weekday .
" Shopping at one of these superstores is a lot like shopping at a department store , " says a Mr. Ko , who works as an engineer for a chemical company in Kaohsiung .
" You go when you 're bored . "
Ko has discovered that as more and more of these stores have opened in Kaohsiung , he and his wife go to department stores less , because in department stores you can only buy clothes , but in superstores you can buy daily necessities , hardware and so forth , and the selection is better .
Shocking the world
The performance of these large retailers in Taiwan has been startling , and superstore chains from Holland , France , the United States and Britain have been arriving on these shores one after another .
A hundred - some foreign stores do NT$ 110 billion in business a year .
According to the Ministry of Finance 's Office of Statistics , business in the first quarter of 2000 for these stores was up 19.54 % over the same quarter the previous year , a higher rate of growth than for convenience stores , supermarkets or department stores .
Since the Dutch firm Makro opened its first Taiwan store in Taoyuan in 1989 , superstores have enjoyed tremendous growth .
The French retailer Carrefour followed Makro 's lead , opening a store in 1989 .
Costco from the United States began planning its first Taiwan store in 1995 , and the French wholesale outlet Casino arrived in 1999 .
A year earlier , the Ruentex group , which owns RT - Mart , bought out two Taiwanese competitors and increased its number of stores to 16 .
That same year , 1998 , Tesco from Britain began to look for sites .
After nearly three years of preparation , in December 2000 they finally opened their first Taiwan store in Taoyuan .
No one had expected that European superstores would be the first to establish a foothold in Taiwan , which had long taken its cues from the American market .
Allen Tien , the head of Carrefour 's public affairs division in Taiwan , relates that Wal
In the Groove , or in a Rut ?
- Life in Middle Age
-LRB- Laura Li / photos by Hsueh Chi - kuang / tr. by Robert Taylor -RRB-
Middle age is the most awkward time .
It 's the age when you ca n't get to sleep till dawn .
The age of sighs but not passion .
The age of sorrow but not anger .
In middle age , you kiss girls on the forehead , not the lips .
It 's the age when you drink strong coffee and take stomach pills .
The age when the phrase " you ca n't escape convention " says it all .
Middle age is afternoon tea .
-LRB- From " Middle Age Is Afternoon Tea , " by Tung Chiao -RRB-
" Middle age is the afternoon , but I ca n't say I have much time to drink tea ! "
Sitting in the silence of his research office , Professor Li Liang - che of the psychology department at National Chengchi University appears pensive .
Indeed , passing 40 is like passing noon .
You miss the fresh , pure , carefree feeling of morning , and the arrogance of noon , yet also yearn for the serene splendor of the sunset .
It is only now , in the afternoon , that worries crowd in , and try as you might you can not raise your flagging spirits .
Worries , ennui - is this a case of that fashionable disease of civilization , the " midlife crisis " ?
" If you 're going to have a crisis , it 's most likely to happen during the " midlife transition , " from 40 to 45 , " says Li .
In people of a melancholy and sensitive disposition , or who have faced many setbacks early in life , it may even set in around the age of 35 .
" In the US , 35 is the maximum age for being in a fraternity , " jokes National Taiwan Normal University audiovisual center director Chao Ning , who is known as a " wunderkind " in the broadcasting world .
After that , your moods begin to seesaw between those of " youth " and " middle age . "
You are perfectly sure that you are in as good form as ever , and have not even reached your peak yet , but looking at all those talented youngsters around you , they seem even more outstanding than yourself , and more like tomorrow 's rising stars .
A vexing feeling of being pushed along by the years gradually builds up , until one day you find yourself high and dry on the shoals of life .
Middle age creeps up on you
" The new waves on the Yangtze River push the old waves along " - i.e. each generation outdoes the last - and in an age of rapid change , the sense of crisis this induces in the older generations is amplified .
A Mrs. Wei , who chose to leave her job as a bookkeeper five years ago because of an unexpected pregnancy , thought at the time that with her ability , experience and contacts it would not be hard for her to find a new job once her child started primary school .
But as the day of her return to the world of work draws ever nearer , she feels a growing sense of panic .
" Most of my old colleagues have left , and the few I 'm still in touch with talk about nothing but things like Excel spreadsheets that I know nothing about ! "
Mrs. Wei has hinted a few times to her husband that she should just stay at home and concentrate on looking after the children .
But thinking of her husband 's grim expression whenever he gives her the housekeeping money , she does n't dare to say it plainly .
In today 's society , youth is beauty .
But in trying to show he was not out of touch with youth , Mr. Chou , the 45 - year - old boss of a computer components company , had an experience which left him not knowing whether to laugh or cry .
He arranged with his young employees to go for a barbecue in a river valley , hoping to get to know them better .
But when they arrived there , the workers formed their own groups , laughing and clowning around , and left him to get on with barbecuing the meat .
When it was done - and he was drenched in sweat - the young people , attracted by the aroma , gathered round .
But after giving him a few words of praise , they wolfed down the food and scattered again immediately , as if he did n't even exist .
" They probably thought their old fogey of a boss had just come to wait on them ! "
From then on Mr. Chou , having recognized his own place in the order of things , made no more attempts to ingratiate himself with his young employees - and in fact felt much the more relaxed for it .
More crises in middle age ?
" By middle age , you have more experience of life , and you are sure to have various realizations and regrets , " says Li Liang - che .
Even if you have no economic worries and as yet no health problems , nonetheless the flowing river of life has carried away your youth , ideals , pure love and even your loved ones , and left you with many wounds you are loth to touch and regrets you are loth to remember .
The sense that the realization of past mistakes has come too late to put them right , and of your remaining days being numbered , makes you feel despondent .
But despondency need not amount to a " crisis . "
According to overseas research , although people have more worries in middle age , only around 15 % have emotional difficulties serious enough to require psychological counseling or medication .
Sociology professor Wang Ya - ke of National Taipei University , who has always been an ardent supporter of feminism and recently became the first scholar to promote " male studies " in Taiwan , offers the following analysis :
The real reason why the " midlife crisis " has become such a hot topic in the US lies with the 75 million " baby boomers " born in the postwar period from 1946 to 1964 .
One can say that this huge generation is the one with the highest level of achievement , and the most diverse set of values , in human history .
Since they gradually began to enter middle age in the late 1980s , they have produced many reminiscences and introspective works about their own mental and spiritual journey , which have elicited a strong response .
The US 's present middle - aged generation have metamorphosed from youthful anti-war protesters and hippies into yuppie managers of multinational corporations , and from idealists into materialists .
The tensions and trauma of that transformation cause their " midlife crisis " to be especially complex .
By contrast , although Taiwan had its own baby boom from 1951 to 1966 , its middle - aged generation have not had the same life experiences , so while they too have their midlife crises , they are much less complex .
Alice Lu , director of the International Family Life Education Center , suggests that " change " would be a better term than " crisis " for the mood swings and difficulties of middle age .
Midlife change , in fact , is a natural process in the journey of life , and as people grow older and have to shoulder ever heavier responsibilities , all kinds of pressures large and small appear together at this time of life .
For example , says Lu , middle - aged people are the meat in a generational sandwich .
Their aging parents increasingly need care , while at the same time their teenage children are at their most rebellious .
Other elements in their lives , such as their job or marriage , have been in existence for ten to 20 years ; the sparkle is gone , yet they have invested too much to just walk away from them .
And again , turning to look at themselves , gray hairs are sprouting from their temples and crows ' feet appearing at the corners of their eyes , their jowls are sagging , and the thick , solid chest muscles of their youth have somehow migrated down to their bellies .
When they take their sons out for some exercise , they do n't even have the strength to do a single pull - up !
Midlife brings many uncertainties , and if it comes in a time of dramatic social change when many role models are being completely rewritten , middle - aged people may be left even more at a loss .
Life is long , the future bleak
Li Liang - che notes that firstly , life expectancy has rapidly increased .
In Taiwan , average life expectancy has risen steadily from 55 years in 1951 to 75 today .
As the journey of life lengthens , middle - aged people become more and more confused about their status in life .
A Mr. Chang , who lives in Hualien , is now 58 , nearing the upper end of middle age .
He recalls that when he saw his parents at age 60 he thought they were " ever so old , " and they seemed quite content to dandle their grandchildren , oblivious to the affairs of the world .
But now that he is approaching the same age himself , he feels he is not yet qualified to call himself old , and still less to speak lightly of retiring .
" We 're living longer , but life is more tiring ! "
He asks , only half in jest : How come nowadays middle age seems to drag on forever ?
With longer lifespans and less rigid social values , patterns of living once shared by all have been replaced by a growing diversity of individual experiences .
In middle age , some people set up successful businesses , while others lose their jobs and are faced with poverty ; working women find themselves squeezed between the exhausting demands of children and housework on the one hand and their jobs on the other , while at the same time many single women face a daily battle with loneliness .
At the age of 50 , some people already have grandchildren at their knee , while others are getting married for the first time .
With more and more people remaining single , rising divorce rates , growing numbers of unmarried mothers , increasing occurrence of infertility , and the emergence of large numbers of families where husband and wife live in different cities , or even - as for many expatriate Taiwanese business people - in different countries , many middle - aged people 's carefully laid life plans have suddenly come to nothing .
Hospital worker Lin Mei - lun -LRB- not her real name -RRB- , lives in Kaohsiung with her two children .
Her ex-husband works in Tainan , and for many years during their marriage he only came home at weekends .
Early last year a late - night phone call shattered the peaceful life she had worked so hard to build .
At the other end was a woman who venomously demanded that Lin Mei - lun give up her husband , or she would bring along her three - and - a - half - year - old illegitimate son and make a scene at the hospital !
The unbearable anguish of being
" Actually , it 's not as if I did n't have my suspicions all those years .
But I never thought things would turn out so awful !
How could I have been such a fool ? "
For the next six months , Lin Mei - lun could hardly sleep or eat .
By day she dragged herself to work like a zombie , but in the middle of the night she would wake with a start , her heart pounding so hard she could n't breathe .
The affair finally ended in divorce , but the upside is that since then her ex has actually behaved better , for he has begun to commute back to Kaohsiung from Tainan every day , and is much more patient with his son and daughter than before .
At present they are planning to remarry , but Lin worries that once her husband is again bound by the chains of marriage , he might return to his old ways .
" Life in middle age is like trying to put together a jigsaw puzzle in a gale .
The more you look at the parts you 've already assembled , the more disjointed and ugly they seem ; but it 's the parts you ca n't finish that you long for more and more , even though you know there 's precious little hope you 'll ever get them done . "
Ms. Lin , who turned 40 this year , says with an air of resignation that if a gust of wind blows the whole puzzle away , the sense of dismay and panic at being tricked by fate can drive you to distraction .
Lin Mei - lun 's mother often comes to stay , and this has done much to lighten the burden of running her household .
But many people who arrive in middle age without the support of a family can only try to weather life 's storms alone .
Ms. Chiang , still single at 46 , is an example .
When she worked as a PR manager for foreign companies such as Hewlett - Packard and Texas Instruments , she was always the highly effective superwoman .
But she realized that under the dual pressure of her need for career success and her unfulfilled emotional needs , she was approaching a state of psychological collapse .
Two years ago , she became seriously depressed .
At night she would toss and turn in bed , but the worry that lack of sleep would make her unable to get up in the morning and would affect her work performance made her even less able to sleep .
Years of looking at a computer screen was causing her vision to deteriorate rapidly , and due to working in a sealed high - tech office she was always dogged by colds , so that every day she felt under the weather .
Live for today
" I asked myself , do you really want to carry on like this ?
What matters more , your work or your health ? "
Ms. Chiang had accumulated some savings during her many years at work , but for the first three months after she resigned her job she could not help a sense of panic , feeling anxious that she might be cast out by society , and also fearing the accusing looks of her friends and family .
But gradually she began to learn to relax and let go .
" Zhuangzi says that life is toil and that death is the time for rest , but I do n't believe all that .
It should n't be that way ! "
After three months , Ms. Chiang no longer put herself under pressure , and no longer got worked up about other people 's well - meaning advice .
Once she stopped having to get up early to go to work , her anxiety about insomnia decreased greatly , and when she was able to adjust her living habits according to her own needs , her depression cleared up by itself .
She began decorating her flat , going to the gym , and cooking the food she likes , and even just sitting lost in thought , enjoying the empty spaces in life .
In particular , having freed herself from the barren existence of a " sexless wage slave " she has begun to liberate her emotional side and enjoy the pleasure of being a woman .
On the subject of family affection and affairs of the heart , Ms. Chiang has also come to a realization .
" My mother died young , and my father always regarded us three children as bloodsuckers , and never showed us any love . "
Because of this , Ms. Chiang left home early to live independently .
But in her heart , her desire for love has never ceased .
Perhaps the shadow of her childhood is behind the setbacks in her love life , so that even today she is still single .
At present , Ms. Chiang has a boyfriend ten years her junior .
" We do n't constrain each other or force each other into anything .
We 're only together when we really want to be . "
The year before last when her father was dangerously ill , he constantly rang his children , begging for their love , which aroused both her sympathy and her disgust .
Having seen through the inconstancy of family affection and romantic attachments , she swore never again to put her emotions at the mercy of others .
She wants to live truly at ease and without being tied down .
Keeping loneliness at bay
For Ms. Chiang , the single life has its freedoms and its loneliness .
But do those who are surrounded by a family have more peace of mind and happiness ?
" No , not necessarily , " answers 51 - year - old Hsiang Chi - tai , a manager at a newspaper , shaking her head .
For the last two years Hsiang Chi - tai has been plagued with capsulitis in her shoulder , and one morning when she could n't manage to fasten her bra before setting off for work , she woke up her son , a university student , to help her .
But her son said banteringly : " You old women really are a pain ! "
Once , Ms. Hsiang asked her two sons which of them was going to look after her when she was old .
But her sons tossed the question back and forth and finally nominated their rather bossy seven - year - old girl cousin !
" I knew they were only joking , but I could n't help feeling sad , and it made me even more aware that in everything you can only rely on yourself .
Anything else is phony ! " says Hsiang .
Having a husband and children , her mother and a lot of friends and relations , and with plenty to do , Ms. Hsiang is never alone , yet she can not help feeling lonely .
Sometimes at night she ca n't sleep and gets up to mop the floor .
For a time she even started playing Tetris .
" Lying in bed , playing with complete concentration , not thinking about anything else , I got up to scores of tens of thousands of points ! " she says , finding this ridiculous even herself .
" Whenever I notice I 'm getting down , I start looking for things to do , " she says .
Middle age is a minefield , and you must n't fall into the trap of letting yourself get downhearted !
The best laid plans
Apart from those to do with health , marriage and work , many other unexpected changes may occur in middle age .
When he was 38 , Chao Ning , who is now a director of the Buddhist satellite TV station LTV and the producer of many Buddhist TV programs , was invited to Houston , Texas to give a lecture .
On the plane he happened to meet Buddhist Master Hsingyun of Foguangshan Temple .
After 14 hours of the master earnestly speaking to him about the principles of Buddhist life , " Even a stone would have been moved ! "
After Chao 's lecture in Houston was over , he immediately took a plane to Los Angeles and went to Hsi Lai Temple , which was just being built .
There he sought out Master Hsingyun and declared his conversion to Buddhism , and since then he has never touched a drop of alcohol .
" Before that , I always had a rhyming couplet pasted up by my doorway which read : ' I know there is wine in this world , / But not that it can make you drunk , ' which was my way of bragging about my drinking prowess . "
What power caused him to make such a great change ?
Chao Ning himself ca n't explain .
" In the US , 38 and 49 are special ages .
I had come to realize many things , and when fate brought the right opportunity , I was ready for a change of heart , " says Chao .
He converted to Buddhism at 38 , got married at " 491?2 , " and before many years had become the " super-old dad " of three children .
The changes in Chao Ning 's life in middle age can not be described as small .
" Looking back , it seems that none of the road I took in life is what I expected . "
Chao reveals that 40 years ago when he was taking his college entrance exams , he put down all kinds of choices of university but deliberately did not include NTNU , because he thought he was not interested in being a teacher .
But although he did not study at NTNU , he went to teach there , and has been there for over 20 years .
" Every year I make a big palaver about wanting to plan my life and how I 'm going to give up teaching and concentrate on broadcasting . "
Chao continues with the same forthright , sincere smile :
" But who 'd have thought that in the blink of an eye my colleagues would be telling me : ' Old Chao , you need n't bother planning , you 're soon going to retire ! ' "
Although he never got around to planning his life , Chao , who has always liked to " follow his feelings , " feels that every step he has taken has been steady and enriching .
Now that he is about to leave middle age for the age of wisdom , this causes him to walk on eagerly , with a spring in his step .
His only real worry is for his three children , now aged seven , five and two years old .
Not daring to get old
" Sometimes when I look at their lovely faces while they sleep , I feel I hav n't done right by them , because I 'm so much older than they are . "
The phrase most often on Chao Ning 's lips nowadays is , " Because my kids are small , I ca n't get old just yet . "
Chao plays basketball three times a week , and is early to bed and early to rise .
Having become a father in middle age , he is doing his best to stay young for his children .
Midlife changes may , as for Chao Ning , be one 's own choices and bring satisfaction .
But there are so many changes which are not chosen and are impossible to prevent , and of these unemployment is one of the most fearsome .
The economic malaise which has spread through Taiwan in just the last two years is rapidly overtaking tens of thousands of middle - aged workers .
" A few days ago I heard about the death of a friend of mine .
After he was forced to retire from Taiwan Machinery Manufacturing Corporation , he set up a stand selling grilled food at Chichin bathing beach in Kaohsiung .
But before long he died of a coronary . "
Simon Chang , former managing director of the Chunghwa Telecom employees ' union , says that on hearing the news , many of the deceased man 's good friends could not help thinking : " If we 'd known he 'd die so young , we should n't have stopped him that time when he wanted to go after the boss of TMMC with a Molotov cocktail ! "
Chang , who worked at CHT for over 10 years , says that next year the company plans to cut its workforce by a full 3,000 people , which means that within the next year 3,000 people will be " forced to retire . "
But the average age of CHT 's workers is only 46
!
Who will tell me ? !
Forty - six - what an awkward age .
The majority of these workers are carrying the tremendous burden of being the breadwinner for three generations .
" The sense of uncertainty about employment has begun to affect every facet of life . "
Simon Chang says that this is a cause of marital tension , and these workers have thousands of questions sticking in their throats , such as : Will they have to interrupt their children 's education ?
Should they accept a transfer , and move the whole family somewhere else ?
What kind of second skill should they learn to keep themselves employable ?
How long a buffer period can the company give them ?
But nobody is willing to give them a clear answer .
Chang suggests that rather than the government spending vast amounts on unemployment benefits , it would be better for it to set up a life guidance and psychological counseling system for workers at all state - owned and private enterprises , as quickly as possible .
" What we want is n't money , but clear guidance to the future ! "
" For a middle - aged person , losing one 's job is just as traumatic as a car accident , falling ill , the death of a spouse or a child running away from home .
It 's an event beyond their control which suddenly turns their life upside - down . "
Chiu Chia - li , director of the Hwo Chyuan Pastoral Counseling Center , describes this kind of occurrence as a " non-normative event . "
Such events are much more traumatic than " normative events " such as job stress , a parent being paralyzed , children growing up and leaving home , or being passed over for promotion , all of which are more predictable .
Looking around us , there are many middle - aged people who , although one can not say they are unemployed , do n't have a regular career .
In his youth , Lin Hung - kui of Chungli in Taoyuan County started up in business from nothing , selling shaved iced snacks .
He did well , and used his money to buy three or four shops and apartments .
In the end he gave up his shop because the work became physically too demanding , but after several failed attempts in other lines of business , today he can only live on his savings and the rent from his apartments .
He has enough to get by , but spending the whole day doing nothing he finds it difficult to face the inquiring glances of neighbors .
Two years ago , encouraged by his wife , who works for an estate agency , Lin went on a pre-work training course at the agency .
Being stuck in among a group of young kids in their twenties , and being subjected to " shock style " training - including listening to pep talks , singing military songs and shouting slogans at the tops of their voices - made Lin feel very uncomfortable .
Finally , after sticking it out for a month , he quit the job on receiving his first pay packet .
" There are many things which young people can do without any inhibitions , but in middle age you build yourself all kinds of high walls which are very hard to escape from . "
Lin counts himself lucky , for he does n't need to break his back just to earn a pittance .
But his mood is always uncertain .
In the last two years he has begun studying the Book of Changes and fengshui , in the hope that he can take his life to a higher level .
A second spring
" In the US , indecision and depression often drive middle - aged people , especially women , to return to college , to clarify their future path through further study . "
Hwo Chyuan Pastoral Counseling Center director Chiu Chia - li quotes her own experience .
At one time she worked simultaneously as a clothing designer , a part - time community worker and a counselor .
Coming from a poor background , she always worked hard to hold down these three jobs .
But the more she saw of life , the more dissatisfied she felt with her own situation , and hoped she could make a new breakthrough .
Although she had been cautious all her life , at the age of 42 she quit her jobs , and with a sense of release tinged with trepidation , went to study overseas .
After leaving Taiwan , Chiu found a school in New York where most of the students were about her age .
Like her , many had come there because they had arrived at a point where they did not know what to do with their lives .
They had not come to earn a degree , but simply , through the process of study , to " sort out their lives bit by bit . "
After five years in New York , Chiu felt she had developed a great deal , and had enough strength to help people who needed help .
So she returned to Taiwan to become a full - time counselor .
" When I felt that I had reached a crisis , I did n't run away from it , but made the crisis into a challenge and faced it with courage . "
Looking back on this phase of her life , Chiu can not suppress a smile .
" I would n't call it success , and it does n't mean I do n't have any struggles left in my life .
But I know I 've had at least one experience of winning a battle with myself , so I can walk my future path more firmly . "
Everyone 's story of middle age is different ; the joys and sorrows of middle age mean different things to different people .

The Human Resources Industry :
A Cooling Economy Heats Up the Competition
-LRB- Teng Sue - feng / tr. by Phil Newell -RRB-
As the global economy enters a down - turn , unemployment , like an already - stretched balloon being filled relentlessly with air , threatens to burst and spoil the dream of economic security .
Last October , Taiwan 's unemployment rate surpassed 3 % , and now more than 300,000 people are jobless .
As the economy fades , business increases for human resources companies , so that the condition of the market for HR firms becomes a reflection of the overall employment situation .
It is estimated that these days , an ordinary person will change jobs an average of seven times in a typical 30 - 40 year working lifespan .
People revolve in a circle whose defining points are employment , job shifts , and unemployment .
So long as people want to find work or change their jobs , the human resources industry has a future .
And the rise of Internet technology has brought a revolution to this market which had changed so little for so long .
Take this job and ....
The largest human resources company in Taiwan is the 104 Job Bank .
The firm 's name comes from the Taiwan number for directory assistance , and suggests that " To look for a job should be as easy as getting a phone number from the operator . "
The company currently has more than 55,000 jobs and 65,000 job - seekers on file .
104 vice president Steven Su says that there are no reliable statistics for the value of the human resources market , because newspapers refuse to disclose their revenues from classified ads .
But , based on the spaces used and prices charged , it could reach as high as NT$ 10 billion , and even a conservative estimate would be NT$ 3 - 4 billion , of which NT$ 1 billion would be in the Internet employment services market .
An indicator of how good this market looks comes from the actions of the United Daily News group .
The UDN is one of the investors behind a new employment magazine called Biung , which is designed in the pattern of Japanese employment magazines , and hit the market in October of 2000 .
And last year the UDN group also opened a website called " udnjob . "
Why does this venerable media giant look so favorably on the human resources market ?
Johnson Lee , vice-president of UDN - Biung , the company that publishes Biung , who has many years of experience in publishing , says that there is a limit to how many people are reached by classified advertising .
Based on a survey conducted by AC Nielsen , only about 3 % of individuals buy newspapers to read the classified ads .
Moreover , from a firm 's point of view , Lee confesses , classified ads are " in fact rather expensive . "
It costs over NT$ 10,000 for an ad of about five centimeters square .
From the newspaper 's point of view , classified ads are n't such a hot property either , since most of the profit goes to the middlemen who take the ads .
These limitations to the traditional job hunting formula are unlikely to be resolved in the short term , says Lee .
Lee explains : " Looking at the Japanese experience , the Asahi Shimbun has a daily circulation of about 10 million , but only one page of classified advertising .
Those looking for new jobs rely more on employment magazines . "
The attraction for similar magazines in Taiwan is being helped along by the current fad for things Japanese , and also by changes in how publications are being sold , with convenience stores getting publications on to the shelves much faster than traditional bookstores ever could .
" With changes in the larger environment and the maturing of the market , this is the time to jump in . "
" The economy is in a downturn , but the human resources market always goes against the current , " says Lee .
In Japan , where the " bubble economy " phenomenon has been the worst , there are hundreds of human resources firms competing .
The leading company had an after - tax income last year of US$ 90 million .
Though there have been suggestions that the Internet is already becoming the main way to find employment , Lee contends that " the obstacles to entry are still great " for the ordinary person : You have to have a computer and be online , and you have to know how to find what you are looking for .
When you consider this , print media is still much more convenient .
The big get bigger
The two largest media groups in Taiwan , whose flagship papers are United Daily News and the China Times , began invading the human resources market two years ago , and existing job banks went on a binge of mergers .
For example , Career Magazine , which has more than a decade of experience in the field , founded an e- counterpart , which then merged with the " 37 " employment website -LRB- the resulting site is now called www.Career.com -RRB- to provide even more comprehensive services .
The big may have gotten bigger , but that has n't stopped newcomers from jumping into the fray .
The Southeast Asia Group , which had previously specialized in bringing foreign labor to Taiwan , founded the 1111 Manpower Bank last year , focusing on five main markets : education , civil service , finance , technology , and part - time work for students .
" The interesting thing about the job bank industry is that no rules of the game have yet taken shape for the Internet .
There is much room for change and flexibility , and no one can guess how much the market might change , " says 1111 public relations manager Linda Miao .
Established firms start with the advantage that many people turn to them out of habit .
But their weakness is that they have information overload , with no special features .
" If latecomers want to transcend the old media , they have to try a different approach .
The 1111 Manpower Bank has adopted the strategy of ' surrounding the cities from the countryside , ' and is striving to work with small and medium - sized enterprises , " she explains .
Finding a profitable market niche is something that all the newcomers have in mind .
Last year , Yam Digital Technology and InterServ International got together in a joint venture to establish HRGini , which targets middle - and high - ranking managers in high - tech fields who have incomes in excess of one million NT dollars per year .
Director Janet Chen relates that the company employs state - of - the - art psychological profiling services , with job candidates first being screened by a psychological consultant in one - on - one interviews ; only if the applicant fits the corporate culture will he or she be recommended to the client firm .
Looking to Greater China
One reason that people are so optimistic about the human resources market is the performance of the market leader - 104 Job Bank .
It began turning a profit after only one - and - a - half years in operation , and its revenues , which were already over NT$ 100 million by 1999 , shot up to NT$ 300 million last year .
The company had only five staff members when they set up shop in 1996 ; now , only four years later , there are 190 .
Though 104 has commissions from more firms than any other in the market , they do not dare slack off .
Steven Su says that " we will always have competition from the traditional media like China Times and United Daily News , " because after all , 104 only works through the Internet .
He does not , however , fear the threat from the CTCareer website , which is under the China Times flag , nor is there anything especially novel about the exploitation of both the Internet and magazine formats by the UDN .
Last year Acer Peripherals invested in a combination website and magazine , but they exhausted their capital within three months .
Moreover , Su is skeptical about the survivability of the UDN 's Biung , " since , at NT$ 20 per issue , they are selling at a loss . "
But the people at UDN - Biung are very optimistic .
As Johnson Lee says : " Some people try to open the market with a shovel .
We are using a bulldozer . "
The UDN group is undertaking a three - pronged attack to crush their competition : continuing to access the wide readership of newspapers , targeting the high - tech sector through the Internet , and using the magazine format for regional companies with small budgets .
Based on past experience , most companies have used up their employment advertising budgets by year 's end , so the market is at a low ebb .
However , when the Chinese New Year passes , many employees , having collected their annual bonuses , want to change jobs , and this is when the market really heats up .
Although the manpower industry focuses on bringing together employers with job - seekers , there is much more to it these days than passing along CVs .
Firms now offer psychological screening , career - suitability evaluations , job training , and reassignment of staff .
Moreover , all these firms are turning their eyes toward the Greater China market .
The 104 Job Bank has been operating beyond Taiwan for some time , having registered its trademark and set up a website in the PRC two years ago -LRB- though it uses 115 in the mainland since that is the number of directory assistance there -RRB- .
HRGini 's Janet Chen says that there is a huge potential client base in the US and the Asia - Pacific region for tech - savvy staff .
And Johnson Lee notes : " If Taiwan can become the main axis of human resources management in the Greater China region , not only will this industry not be adversely affected by Taiwan 's economic downturn , it will also not be hurt by the large - scale move by Taiwan companies to the PRC . "
As we watch the race heating up between amalgamated veteran firms and ambitious newcomers , let us hope that the real winners turn out to be employers and job - seekers .

Magazines are also trying to get a piece of the job - hunting market .

The husband has been laid off and there is no money for the children 's tuition .
What can one do ?
Women 's groups have protested at the Legislative Yuan , calling for more attention to the problem of unemployment .
The government will spend more than NT$ 60 billion on infrastructure projects expected to create more than 40,000 jobs .

About Mayaw Biho
-LRB- Alexandra Liu / tr. by Robert Taylor -RRB-
Mayaw Biho -LRB- Chinese name Peng Shih - sheng -RRB- was born in 1969 .
His father is a native of Hunan Province in mainland China and his mother is an Amis .
Mayaw Biho , who calls himself half Amis , grew up in the Amis village of Cero -LRB- Chunjih -RRB- in Hualien County .
He never lived away from the village until he went to study cinematography at Taipei 's Shih Hsin University .
After coming to live in the city , Mayaw gradually came to realize how mainstream society in Taiwan regards the island 's aboriginal peoples , and became aware of the gap between reporting and reality .
He wished to break away from the all - pervasive practice of reporting aboriginal affairs from a purely Han Chinese perspective , and approach them anew from an aboriginal standpoint .
From filming " Aboriginal News Magazine " and " Our Island " for Public Television Service and " Declaration of Life " for Super TV , to becoming the independent director he is today , Mayaw has always insisted on following his own ideas .
Mayaw loves documentary films above all else .
While at university , he began making his first four films , " Spring Sun " is Our Name : Pangcah Paddlers from Spring - Sun Village ; As Life , As Pangcah ; Children in Heaven and Pangcah Artist : Gi Lahaz .
After graduating , he completed such films as Dear Rice Wine , You Are Defeated ; National Bandits and The Land in Our Hearts .
Mayaw 's filming of the story of Lukar Maku 's life has already entered its third year .
As Life , As Pangcah was only the first part .
During his summer vacation in the first year of filming , Mayaw went to live in Lukar 's home .
He spent all his time with the old man , and witnessed his perseverance and insistence on upholding Amis culture .
Lukar said that Mayaw 's documentary " shows just what it is a person of my age does . "
But he also told him : " Mayaw , you have to work faster .
You must come and see me more often . "
Mayaw too urges himself to work harder to finish editing the films he has already shot - of Lukar talking about tribal life , hunting , religion and war - to allow the story of the Amis to be told on this island where they have lived for thousands of years .
Chinese New Year 's Eve - Doing it the Modern Way
With celebrations for the long - anticipated start of the year 2000 barely over , Chinese people began busily preparing to mark another new year .
" Spring Festival , " as it is known , brings a longer break from work - compared with Western New Year - and is an altogether more meaningful occasion for the Chinese .
Amid today 's sweeping tide of modernization , Spring Festival is probably the only annual occasion left with a truly " Chinese " flavor .
So how do people celebrate Chinese New Year nowadays ?
How much of the ancient form of the festival survives , and what new elements have been added in our time ?
Under the crisp and pleasant skies of late December , Mrs. Pu , a woman in her late fifties who lives in a military dependents ' village in Taoyuan , hastens to place her order for 40 catties -LRB- 24 kg -RRB- of streaky pork .
When the meat arrives she chops it into one - catty strips , then steeps these in a marinade of dry - fried star anise and other spices , mixed with rock sugar , salt and Gaoliang liquor .
After several days of preparation , the result is larou , or end - of - year cured meat .
There 's still over one month to go before Spring Festival , but as Mrs. Pu explains : " It takes a fairly long time to make larou , and you have to make allowance for the weather .
It 's best to get going early so that you have the meat ready to give out to friends and relatives in time for New Year . "
Her ever - popular larou is made in accordance with a time - tested recipe .
She adds the spices in their special proportions , and then seals the meat in a vat to marinate for six days so as to ensure a full flavor .
After being removed from the vat the strips are slowly smoked over a mixture of sugarcane bark , charcoal , orange peel and rice husks , until they have acquired a lovely luster and exude a delicious aroma .
Finally the cured strips are hung out for two or three days in the sun to draw off excess fat .
For Mrs. Pu and her husband , the traditional lunar new year has more significance than the Western version .
It provides the opportunity for making food in the traditional style of their home region , much of which they give to others , and also brings the whole family together for an eagerly awaited celebration .
New Year 's Eve dinner is the highlight , with three generations - more than ten hungry mouths - gathered for the feast .
" We need at least ten New Year dishes , " says Mrs. Pu .
In addition to servings of chicken , duck , fish and pork , they always have some of the specialties of her husband 's home region , Anhui Province in mainland China , including yuanzi meatballs -LRB- minced pork blended with chopped spring onion , ginger , garlic and rice noodles , rolled in cornstarch flour and deep - fried -RRB- .
Other favorites such as pearl balls -LRB- meatballs wrapped in sticky rice -RRB- , pork knuckle in brown sauce , and mixed vegetables , dishes that Mr. and Mrs. Pu like to make for themselves and others all year round , also appear at the table , all cooked with extra special attention for New Year .
In fact , preparations for the feast begin three or four days before the event itself .
Slowly warming up
The timing of Chinese New Year is determined by the traditional lunar calendar and marks an important transition , the point when Winter gives way to Spring .
In China , a country founded on farming , there has always been a tangible link between seasonal changes and the pattern of agricultural production .
As this link was absorbed into people 's lives it gave rise to the rituals of rural existence , the most prominent of which marked the conclusion of the natural cycle at the end of every year .
Thus New Year became the most important of all traditional festivals , symbolizing endless rebirth and the continuation of the natural cycle .
While underpinning the annual cycle of festivals and the daily routine of the people , New Year also , through its religious - type observances , came to express Chinese people 's ideas about life , nature , and clan society .
The attitudes and lifestyles of the Chinese are also given full expression through the various activities that take place during the holiday .
Traditions such as sweeping the house to " drive out the old and bring in the new , " venerating the gods , making offerings to ancestors , having the whole family eat together and stay up late on New Year 's Eve , calling on friends and relatives on New Year 's day , and - for married women - visiting their parents on the following day .
In spite of the changes wrought by modernization , which make it impossible for the New Year to be celebrated in exactly the way that it used to be , and regardless of the simplifications that have taken place , Spring Festival remains the longest and most important holiday in the calendar .
It is , as ever , a time of plenty and of family reunion - a great occasion for everyone .
Homeland of the soul
Food is an obsession with the Chinese , and never more so than at New Year when virtually every family - like Mrs. Pu 's in Taoyuan - enjoys one or two dishes prepared to their own " private " recipe , plus other edible treats with special symbolism .
For most people , dishes such as these are forever bound up with the spirit of New Year .
Writer Lin Wen - yueh has penned numerous articles on the culture of food and drink in recent years , including a vignette -LRB- from her collection of essays Epicurean Notes -RRB- about New Year with the family , entitled " Luobo Pudding . "
" When the Chinese do New Year , one type of specialty is indispensable : New Year pudding . . . .
However , as China covers such a vast territory , this pudding comes in different versions according to region .
For example , people in the belt south of the Yangtze River generally eat " Ningpo pudding , " made from sticky rice shaped into broad bars , while those hailing from Guangdong and the Southern Fujian region go for luobo pudding , made from a mixture of shredded white turnip -LRB- luobo -RRB- and long - grain rice .
As Lin writes : " Although my family moved around a lot when I was little , Mother was quite stubborn about personally taking charge in the kitchen every New Year to make luobo pudding for the whole family .
So when we spent New Year in Shanghai , we did n't have Ningpo pudding like the rest of the people there , and when we were in Tokyo we did n't have the " mirror cake " that they like in Japan .
No matter where we were , it was always luobo pudding for us . "
Lin recalls that there were so many mouths to feed at New Year that they had to use two or three large bamboo steamers to make the puddings .
Come New Year , the children were always attracted by the unusually busy atmosphere in the kitchen , and loved running in and out to check on what was going on , meanwhile getting under everyone 's feet .
Lin 's mother was n't too happy about this , and the kitchen helpers would impatiently wave the kids away , calling : " Shoo ! Shoo ! Go outside and play ! "
However , as Lin grew up , her mother would call her and the other girls to her side to watch and help out .
She said : " Follow closely , now .
One day I 'll be gone , and you 'll have to do this all by yourselves . "
Making luobo pudding is a demanding process and requires plenty of ingredients .
Nowadays there 's no need to wait for New Year - the pudding can be sampled throughout the year at Hong Kong - style dimsum restaurants or bought readymade in the market .
But come the last month in the lunar calendar , Lin Wen - yueh still prepares several luobo puddings the old - fashioned way , so that her family and friends can enjoy New Year pudding " the way mama used to make it . "
Difficult time of year
Nowadays it is n't so easy to recreate the elaborate New Years of the past .
The speeded - up , stripped - down pace of modern life has reduced the event in scale , and people now regard New Year in different ways according to how it fits in with their lives .
Surveys show that among the Chinese , New Year is ranked as one of the most stressful facets of life .
A tale from the past shows how New Year has always been a source of financial pressure for families .
During the Ming dynasty -LRB- 1368 - 1644 -RRB- , a Fuzhou prefectural magistrate named Cai Junmo issued an order for every family in the district to light seven lanterns for Lantern Festival -LRB- the 15th day of the first lunar month -RRB- .
One of the residents of the prefecture , a man named Chen Lie , satirized the magistrate 's order with a verse that he painted on a large lantern :
" In the homes of the rich , lanterns are as plentiful as rice in the granary /
In the homes of the poor , a single lantern reduces fathers and sons to misery /
The carefree magistrate may not be aware of this /
And simply complains that the music is n't good enough . "
In the Haifeng area of Guangdong Province , there is a saying to describe the hardship that the holiday brings for the poor - whom the festival often relieved of a whole year 's worth of painstakingly accumulated surplus : " Those with money celebrate New Year ; those without money get stripped bare . "
This was especially so given that the " close of the year " was also the time when creditors turned up to claim their dues and " close " their accounts .
Chen Chih - fan , the scientist and well - known essayist , once described how he , as the eldest son in a poor family , used to spend the days before New Year writing and selling spring couplets in the market , so as to help his father pay off debts and buy goodies for his siblings .
On account of his skill at calligraphy , Chen spent many a New Year in this fashion .
As a successful scholar he was later able to recall this episode with pride , yet the bitterness and hurt still showed through in his words .
Tough work , year after year
On top of economic pressures , New Year , for many housewives , brings the added burden of endless household chores .
In the past , this meant a nonstop round of house cleaning , making pudding , doing the New Year shopping and making new clothes , starting from the 8th day of the 12th lunar month .
There was also the matter of performing the prescribed observances to heaven and earth , the ancestors , the kitchen god and various other deities .
Things are simpler nowadays , but putting together a New Year dinner to fill the bellies of everyone in the family still presents an enormous culinary and physical challenge .
For those who live far from the parental home , there 's the added trial of transport conditions - congested roads , fully - booked trains and airplanes - to foil the plans of all who would hurry home in time to spend New Year 's Eve with the clan .
And if you live in a large family with plenty of old folk and youngsters - all expecting red envelopes of cash - your hard - earned year - end bonus may well be gone by the time New Year is over .
In recent years , New Year has increasingly shown up on the agenda of the women 's movement .
Many women now object to the tradition of spending New Year 's Eve with the family of their spouse , rather than at the homes of their own parents , and point out that this is one of the nasty little legacies of a patriarchal society , something which goes against the modern principle of sex equality .
" I 'm an only daughter , and my father has passed away , so I really hate leaving mom to spend New Year 's Eve all alone . "
" When we go over to my husband 's family , it 's nothing but nonstop cleaning and cooking ! "
These are some of the many complaints expressed by women writing to the letters pages in the press .
For many people , the solution is to book a holiday abroad at this time of year so as to avoid the whole occasion .
Others opt to splash out on dinner at a hotel or restaurant so that no - one has to worry about getting everything ready .
For modern , urban families , these are two of the fashionable and convenient new ways of surviving New Year .
A bittersweet evening
" The most scary thing is the deep - seated clan mentality of the Chinese , " says Li Yuan , an author known for his writings on the topic of family .
" It can tangle the relationship between parents and children into a never - unraveled web of pain and intimacy - which does n't always make for happy family reunions . "
No wonder New Year 's Eve is frequently a time of generational conflict .
Li describes the case of his own family .
His mother and father came from Hakka backgrounds on the mainland , and as clan identity is strongly emphasized in Hakka culture , his father used to require all his children and grandchildren to be at the family home for dinner on New Year 's Eve .
Concerned about the burden on the old couple , Li persuaded them to hold the annual get - together at his house , with dinner prepared by his wife and sisters .
Striving valiantly to create a party atmosphere , Li took a leaf out of " Old Laizi 's " book , -LRB- Old Laizi was a legendary paragon of filial piety who acted like a child well into his seventies just to keep his parents amused -RRB- , dreaming up little pranks with the help of his children .
For example , they gave mischievous names to each of the dishes served for New Year 's Eve dinner , like " Dongfang the Invincible 's Chopped - off Willy , " " The Flower of Guanyin 's Slender Waist , " and " Sea Cucumber , Squid and Meatballs - a Three - in - one World . "
" The mood of good cheer and togetherness at New Year can indeed leave some heart - warming memories , " acknowledges Li Yuan .
" But the occasion can also dredge up less pleasant associations from the past . "
During New Year 's Eve six years ago , Li 's father could n't stop himself getting worked up , in spite of the family 's best efforts to keep the mood light .
Dinner was nearly over when the old fellow demanded that his children come to his side , and announced : " I want to square up accounts with every one of you , each in turn . . . . "
He began to lecture them about how hard he had struggled in his youth to bring them all up , recalling every little incident as though it were yesterday .
He broke down in tears once he got onto the things that had hurt him , and after that there was no calming him down .
" He had absolutely no idea that his children all had to swallow their own share of hurt and disappointment while growing up , but never complained to him .
Now each of them felt afresh the grievances of childhood , and began to strike back , one after another . "
Li described the ensuing scenario :
" Some wheeled out their heavy artillery and some used the machine - gun approach .
Cannon and gunfire rang out on that cold rainy night , while tears flowed and fireworks exploded .
The old bruiser , nearly 80 years old , was struck speechless .
His authority lay in tatters , long since torn down by his adult offspring .
He 'd taken so many hits by then that he was riddled with bullet - holes .
He slumped miserably back into his chair , lips quivering as if to speak , but no words coming from his mouth . "
The evening ended in tears and awkwardness .
" Our family was quite poor when we were growing up , " says Li , " and Father suffered plenty of frustrations on our behalf .
He thought that we had n't properly repaid him once we had grown up , and felt quite bitter about it .
But he did n't realize that we too , growing up in such circumstances , faced hardship and frustration .
Like my elder sister who had to work her way through school .
Everyone had something to get off his chest .
It all got quite heated . "
Li felt depressed and guilty about the way the evening turned out .
When he went over to his parents house the next day to pay his New Year respects , he asked his children to help smooth things over , and he scrubbed clean the toilet bowl as penance .
Li Yuan 's father passed away the year before last .
His mother , more relaxed about things than her husband , was n't concerned about doing a New Year 's Eve dinner , so last year the family cancelled the tradition .
" Mom decided to take a trip abroad .
My family and I like the unusual quiet that descends on Taipei 's streets for the period of the festival , and since we did n't want to make any special arrangements , we just stayed home and had a good rest . "
A quiet New Year
" What we are missing , " says author Yang Hsiao - yun , " is a way of bringing new meaning into the old tradition , a way of spending New Year that suits ordinary people . "
Yang 's strongest association with New Year is of going to do the New Year 's shopping with the grown - ups when she was little .
" We were always very thrifty in those days , without extra cash for new things .
New Year was the only time when we got to bring bulging bags and packages back to the house .
Just the sight of all those treats - chicken , duck , fish and pork ; candies and cookies ; fruits and soda drinks - was a thrill for us .
Then there were all the New Year presents , like new clothes , shoes and hats .
At New Year our parents liked to dress the girls in red from head to toe , for good luck and for fun .
We looked as if we 'd been dipped in a tub of haw juice . "
In spite of the excitement that she remembered feeling , as a child , about getting to wear new clothes and new hats , Yang later began to question this way of spending New Year .
She felt especially turned off by the orgy of consumption connected with the festival .
" It was only after I had kids of my own that I began to rethink the importance of New Year - partly out of nostalgia , and partly to pass the tradition on to my children , " admits Yang .
Nowadays she emphasizes just three aspects of the occasion : getting the family together , enjoying the festive spirit , and having a rest .
" At one point we tried the fashionable thing , taking the family away for a vacation , but being abroad we really missed that festive flavor . "
Eventually she returned to the traditional form , making the New Year 's Eve dinner herself , and always including a Manchurian - style pickled cabbage hotpot prepared just the way her parents used to do it .
-LRB- Her father hailed from Liaoning Province in mainland China . -RRB-
" With life as busy and stressful as it is the rest of the year , we decided to drop the formal New Year gathering .
Instead , we now spend the time relaxing at home , doing whatever we fancy , be it sitting quietly and reading , listening to music , going on an outing , or talking about the ups and downs of the past year .
Or we might invite a couple of close friends round to reminisce about old times .
It 's quiet , and it 's really satisfying .
" On the other hand , " continues Yang , " the end of the year can also serve as a reminder for people to review their past actions . "
She always sets aside a little time for herself on New Year 's Eve to do just this .
As midnight approaches , and with all the household chores taken care of , Yang settles down to quietly reflect on how she has grown during the past twelve months , and to draw up her personal " profit and loss sheet " for the year .
" It 's nothing to do with money , " she stresses .
" It 's a way of measuring whether I 've achieved my objectives , in my work and in my personal maturity .
I ask myself what my bad habits are .
It 's a kind of New Year 's Eve dish for the spirit ! "
Yang feels that if we redefine New Year in terms of its contemplative and spiritual meaning , rather than just regarding it as an occasion for feasting and partying , then we can better sense how time passes , and see that another phase in our working lives has been completed .
In this way we can make our wishes for the year ahead , setting goals for work and for personal growth , without getting maudlin about time 's passage and the meaninglessness of it all .
For the Chinese , the family is the basic unit for celebrating New Year , but the family , like society , has been changing in recent years .
Couples whose children have grown up and moved out , face the " empty nest syndrome , " while many individuals , particularly among the elderly , live on their own .
However , for people like these , and for the homeless , there are still ways of enjoying " a good get - together " at New Year .
All together now
One month before last year 's Chinese New Year , artist Wang Cheng - liang placed some articles in the press seeking others like himself - single people with nothing special to do on New Year 's Eve - to register for a New Year 's Eve dinner and party at his studio .
You did n't have to know anyone else going .
Plenty of people took up the offer , and the party was packed .
For Wang , it was the most fun he 'd ever had at New Year .
Lin Wen - yueh moved to California once her children had grown up and started families of their own , so she can no longer spend New Year with her immediate family .
But her enthusiasm for the festival has n't waned .
" Now I spend New Year with friends who are in similar circumstances to me .
Each of us brings a dish for the meal , and makes his own contribution .
It 's all very relaxed . "
For Lin , friendship is as heart - warming as family ties .
" New Year is part of our shared cultural and ethnic memory .
It 's a homeland of the soul for every one of us .
The external form may have changed , but the memory of some inner yearning , that sense of needing to belong , these are things that can never change . "
For those often - overlooked old folk and street people , there are special New Year dinners organized by private welfare groups , enabling them to share in the human warmth of the occasion .
Last year the Buddha 's Light International Association organized New Year 's Eve dinners in the north , center and south of Taiwan , which were attended by more than 5,000 old folk who live alone .
This year they are repeating the exercise , and are including a special event in Nantou County to bring some warmth and love to elderly survivors of the 9 / 21 earthquake there .
Another group , the Creation Social Welfare Foundation - which is well known for its work with street people and for taking care of vegetative - state patients - runs an annual New Year 's Eve party for homeless people .
" Giving and serving , these too form part of the meaning and purpose of New Year . "
The Venerable Yung Fu of the Buddha 's Light International Association hopes that today 's well - fed , well - clothed people of Taiwan can extend the warmth and love of their own families out to society at large , and especially to those most in need of attention , so as to widen and elevate the meaning of New Year .
It is no surprise that amid the hectic pace of modern life , some of the relaxed good fun has gone out of Chinese New Year .
But as a custom that has been part of the culture for so long , it continues to occupy a unique position in our hearts and lives .
What remains to be seen is how well we can adapt and update this ancient tradition to fit the changing needs of modern society .
Gods of Wealth , Please Report !
-LRB- Chang Chin - ju / photos by Hseuh Chi - kuang / tr. by Jonathan Barnard -RRB-
The Taiwanese economy may be slump - ing , but people still have to eat and drink .
The Chinese have traditionally listed seven essentials for any household : firewood , rice , oil , salt , soy sauce , vinegar , and tea .
But there is still another item that only seems to grow more indispensable the harder times become .
Indeed some say that unless you have a wealth charm - " the eighth household essential " - you will never find peace of mind !
Here at the start of the 21st century , the Year of the Snake is upon us .
Have you found your path to prosperity ?
Have you identified the mascots of money - making ?
If you ask the shopkeepers in the main streets or back alleys , they will tell you that the favorite figure of the moment is the Maneki Neko , or Japanese " beckoning cat , " whose Chinese name is literally " wealth - attracting cat " -LRB- -LRB-c-RRB-?Ìö]o? -RRB- .
The Maneki Neko has ridden a wave of fashion for things Japanese to superstardom in Taiwan , and its sales have n't suffered a whit with the slumping economy .
Not only are Japanese foodstuff shops and Japanese product counters at department stores quickly selling out of their regular shipments of these feline fortune finders , Maneki Nekos were even on sale in the run - up to New Year 's at the roadside stalls selling traditional Chinese holiday paraphernalia , such as lanterns and spring couplets on red paper .
They smiled flirtatiously at shoppers from between the potbellied Buddhas and the mock gold ingots .
Amid the crowds and the hubbub at the Sogo in Taipei , Taiwan 's top - grossing department store , it 's clear that these kitties bring more than just good financial fortune .
Check out this rack full of copycat charms that have come from Japan on Maneki Neko 's tail .
Take , for instance , this litter of Fengshui Kitties , lined up here with each holding a different colored pearl : red , purple , blue , white or yellow .
The Fengshui Kitty with the yellow pearl , which specializes in attracting money , is now selling even better than Maneki Neko !
Foreign cats , local toads
But there is no need to restrict our survey to foreign felines .
Chinese are , as a rule , fengshui experts who will consider the auspiciousness of virtually anything .
For that matter , the Chinese display a willingness to believe in the auspiciousness of just about anything !
Hence , they have never lacked their own stately or amusing charms to pull in wealth and keep it within a household .
The Chinese folk charms of financial good fortune have a great variety of origins , an abundance that is due in large part to the Chinese people 's virtuosity at making things up as they go along .
For starters , there is the God of Wealth on the peachwood charms that people bring out for the New Year .
Round - faced and smiling , he wears a mandarin 's hat and robes , and his very presence seems to exude affluence and good times .
Amiable and ubiquitous local land gods can also be seen grasping silver or gold ingots , doing their bit to bring wealth to the neighborhood .
By some twist of fate even the Daoist deity Guan Gong , who never made much money during his time as a mortal , has come to be regarded as a god of wealth .
Love of money has been a constant across the ages , observable in such time - honored Chinese traditions as burning incense to pray to gods of wealth .
Many Chinese wealth charms are traditional objects that have long been ascribed these powers .
The three - legged toad , whose origins lie in a classic folktale , is an old favorite that has never fallen from popular favor .
According to legend , a Daoist master named Liu Hai and a three - legged golden toad scattered gold coins across the land .
If one of these fell into your home , your family would enjoy prosperity for thousands of years .
The earliest known depiction of this toad is the " toad in the moon " found in a Han dynasty silk painting that was unearthed in the Mawangdui Tombs .
Because of the legend of Liu Hai teasing the golden toad , toads became auspicious symbols revered throughout China ever since the Eastern Han dynasty -LRB- AD 25 - 220 -RRB- .
According to legend , Liu Hai was the student of a miserly Daoist master .
This master turned out to be corrupt and was put into a well for punishment , where he became a three - legged toad .
Liu Hai 's attempts to save his master repeatedly failed .
Finally , Liu Hai came up with the idea of tying a silk thread to a traditional Chinese coin , which he threw into the well .
When his teacher saw the coin , he could n't help but bite .
From that moment , the three - legged toad became a symbol of wealth , and the image of Liu Hai on the back of the toad with a large gold ingot in his outstretched arms became a favorite subject for folk art .
In the 1980s the three - legged toad managed to separate from Liu Hai .
It came to be marketed as an auspicious figure in its own right .
The higher the stock market soared , the more plastic three - legged toads were pulled from their manufacturing molds .
You could also buy brass toads that held coins in their mouths .
These served as money charms for shops , whose owners would turn them facing outward in the morning so as to attract wealth inside .
Then , when the shopkeepers closed their stores at dusk , they 'd turn the toads around , so that none of the good fortune would slip away overnight .
Today you can still see three - legged toads at jade markets and night markets .
It 's just that with the fashion for things Japanese , Maneki Nekos prevail , and figures of three - legged toads are not nearly as prevalent as they once were .
But the potbellied , grinning figure of Maitreya Buddha is so pleasing that his popularity even today is no less than Maneki Neko 's .
You can often find the two of them next to each other in stores and markets .
Moreover , the potbellied Buddha by himself is still a popular motif for china , as well as for jade and wood carvings .
Maitreya Buddha has also been transformed into the figure of a monk carrying a burlap sack .
Whatever you give to this old monk , he puts in the sack behind him .
But as this smiling old man takes with one hand , he gives with the other .
Look carefully at the plump Buddhas found in stores and homes .
Notice the full sack of stuff that is often found behind them .
What treasures lie within ?
That we leave to the beholder 's imagination .
Money trees and golden eggs
Then there are the assorted golden animals or other objects that are variations on the theme of the golden hen , the Chinese equivalent of the goose that lays the golden egg .
The name for the spotted leopard in Chinese is jinqian bao , or " money leopard " - so named because its spots look like coins .
This name has made the spotted leopard a common motif for costume jewelry .
Sometimes auspicious objects are chosen for a play on words .
For instance , because the first character in the Chinese compound for " coffin " -LRB- guan: ÛDÌ’ -RRB- is a homonym for a character that means " high official " -LRB- -LRB-c-RRB-x -RRB- , and the second character -LRB- cai: s? -RRB- is a homonym for a character that means " wealth " or " money " -LRB- Ìö] -RRB- , coffins became popular symbols of good fortune a few years back .
Foot - long red coffins would sit on counters in big stores , and people would carry around mini-coffin key chains .
Normally superstitious people were willing to break the strong taboo associated with coffins because of the double allusion to the phrase " sheng guan fa cai " -LRB- Ìò...-LRB-c-RRB-x˙goÌö] -RRB- , which means , " Attain high office and make a fortune . "
The owners of the various shops that sell wealth charms all agree that when sales of other lines flag , business for these charms only increases .
They are true " money trees . "
With the economic downturn , Wang Nien - feng , a florist who often works for the television and entertainment industries , has had plenty to sigh about .
He reveals that showbusiness promotion budgets have been cut in half .
As a consequence , his flower - arranging business has likewise shriveled .
But just a few steps down the street is another flower shop whose salesclerk says that business is n't bad at all .
Looking around , you notice that there is a collection of flashily ornamented " gold ingot trees " at the front of the shop .
These are placed in pots shaped liked gold ingots .
Mock gold ingots also hang like fruit from the branches , which are festooned with red ribbon bows .
At the other end of the store is a line of long - branched gold money trees .
Thick round leaves grow from the branches in groups of four , giving each branch the appearance of being a string of coins .
Although these imported plants are in high demand , none of the salesclerks at any of the stores seem to have any idea what the proper name for them is .
In any case , most buyers do n't ask .
As long as the trees are said to attract money , they are sure to fly out of the store and into people 's homes .
" These types of money trees are the favorite of banks , " affirms the owner of the " Tip Top " flower store on Pateh Road .
But banks are far from the only purchasers of them .
When the economy is weak , shops frequently close , undergo renovations and open up again with new proprietors .
These inexpensive and auspicious money charm trees make excellent gifts for friends opening new stores !
For the florists who are smart enough to sell these arrangements made with ivy , shaving - brush trees and " gold ingot trees , " it is only a slight exaggeration to say that their business improves the worse the economy gets !
To bank on fish tanks
But the truth is that objects said to attract money sell just as well in good times as bad , for when the economy is strong , people are willing to spend large sums to ensure that they can hold onto their wealth .
For instance , the stock market last peaked amid a craze for fengshui fish tanks and crystals .
Since water is the Chinese element that indicates wealth , many business people like to keep fish tanks .
Huang Chiung - yu , who has been selling fish and aquariums for more than a decade , points out that for a few years entrepreneurs were installing NT$ 200,000 - 300,000 fish tanks in their homes or offices .
While the falling stock market has meant that aquarium sellers have had to lower their prices , they have found no shortage of customers willing to take advantage of these bargains .
Since fish tanks help you change your fate when something bad is expected , and otherwise help to attract money , they are perennial hot sellers .
A Miss Lai works for a broadband Internet access provider and is responsible for taking care of two large office fish tanks .
Her company has been hit by the slumping economy and is striving to cut down on expenses .
Nevertheless , there is no consideration being given to reducing the NT$ 5,000 - 6,000 spent each month on cleaning the tanks , let alone any thought of cutting back on the money spent on fish food or the occasional replacement fish .
The Core Pacific eCommerce Co. , which just this year got involved in the fish and aquarium business , correctly predicted that the economic downturn would mean an increase in those needing fish tanks to soothe their financial psyches .
With an eye on this group , as well as on those consumers replacing old money charms with new ones or those buying auspicious objects for the New Year , Core Pacific devised a marketing plan to sell the seven major money - charmed fish .
The company takes orders over the Internet , offers the services of experts who make house calls , and delivers .
Customers hence save time and energy .
Core 's best - selling fish include carp , goldfish , and " blood parrotfish , " which are red and round like balls .
The market for crystals has also managed to retain its luster .
Crystals are said to alter force fields and thereby improve one 's physique , regulate one 's qi , and bolster one 's finances .
For going on ten years now , they 've been hot sellers in Taiwan .
Crystal markets have sprung up like mushrooms after rain , and shops where a premium is put on color coordination , such as florists or clothing stores , often use unfinished whole crystals or amethysts to add panache to their decor .
Huang Hao - chuan , an importer , exporter and processor of gems , says that crystals in Taiwan used to come exclusively from Brazil and Russia , but recently mainland China and Madagascar have emerged as additional sources of supply .
The growth in supply suggests that crystals ' star has n't fallen yet .
Huang explains that the price of crystals is n't what it once was .
Yet sales quantities are up , thereby offsetting the falling profit margins .
May you prosper !
While the hot sales of money charms are no doubt partly attributable to the enterprising efforts of dealers and retailers , the slumping economy and growing number of fortunetellers have also played a part in the boom .
Those who habitually get their fortunes told are naturally given to installing a fish tank here at one moment and positioning a crystal over there the next .
But recently many people who are not ordinarily superstitious have sought the services of fortunetellers when they 've seen the value of their stocks decline .
They might be told something along these lines : " Get a dragon or a God of Wealth carved in a topaz and the deity Taishang Laojun carved in an amethyst , and hang them over your chest from a string of Chinese knots .
Otherwise , you can hang a yucai painting at home , and perform good deeds on the third , sixth and eighth day of every lunar month .
Only by so doing will you meet with good fortune ! "
If you want to avoid going to all this trouble , you might instead consult the traditional Chinese farmers ' almanac , which suggests that during bad times people can turn their fortunes by repositioning their water coolers or hot water dispensers .
Of course , it 's up the individual to decide whether to believe in any of this .
May you meet with good fortune and prosperity in the New Year !

My Heart is in Macau :
" Local Portuguese " Carlos Marreiros
-LRB- Jackie Chen / tr. by Brent Heinrich -RRB-
Around the time of the Macau handover , questions that were hot in the Western media were , What is " Macaense " ?
And what is native Macau culture ?
This is Carlos Marreiros 's story .
The story began during the era of great sailing ships .
Four hundred years ago , a Portuguese trading vessel dropped anchor off the island of Macau , intent on doing business with imperial China .
That one brief rest stop destined Macau to become a cultural montage that includes Chinese , Indian , Malay , Portuguese and other European influences .
Today , Macaense -LRB- or Macanese -RRB- , the free mix of the various ethnic currents of Macau has become the most vibrant element of its culture .
" Without it , Macau would n't exist , " says Carlos Marreiros , who once served as director of the Macau government 's bureau of culture , and now works as an architect , painter , author and poet .
Ethnic melting pot
Marreiros is a typical Macanese .
His grandfather was Portuguese , his grandmother Chinese .
His mother has a mix of Spanish and Malay blood .
In Macau , he 's what is known as a " local Portuguese . "
Marreiros was born in Macau , but " most of my education took place in Europe , " he says .
He attended university in Lisbon , received his master 's degree in Germany , and went on to study landscaping in Sweden .
His principal impressions of China come from his family and his contacts with Chinese people .
When he was young , Marreiros worked in a Macau post office .
One of his coworkers was a Chinese of the older generation , who often chatted with him about Tang - dynasty poetry , and Chinese proverbs and myths .
For a while Marreiros taught Chinese people how to speak Portuguese .
" I learned quite a lot about the way many Chinese people think , " he says .
Carlos Marreiros speaks fluent Portuguese , Cantonese , English and German .
He has done research on traditional Chinese poetry , and has included some in his Portuguese - language writings .
He personally manifests a blend of Chinese and Western influences .
Marreiros emphasizes that in addition to Chinese and Portuguese influences , Macau also has its own unique blend of culture - Macaense , which is exhibited in " local Portuguese " of mixed ancestry such as himself .
" The world 's first mixed-race culture appeared in Macau , " he says .
Now with the convenience of travel and transportation , the intermingling of black , white and yellow peoples is nothing new , but 400 years ago , the people of Macau intertwined cultures from as far afield as India , Southeast Asia and Japan .
Their influences can be seen everywhere in the cuisine , architecture and literature of Macau .
Intellectual assets
In the enclave 's restaurants , such classic Macanese dishes as curry and Portuguese chicken are served up with a wide variety of seasonings , blending the sweet flavors of Cantonese dishes with the rich , tangy taste of old-style Indian fare .
One example is Macanese baoguo , a combination of Chinese sausage , cabbage and tripe - not precisely Portuguese , nor Cantonese either .
The exteriors of traditional Macau buildings are noticeably southern European in style .
But Marreiros , an architect , points out that while the outsides of many houses are European , the arrangement of rooms and furniture inside is often done in a Chinese manner .
" The important space is given to the father and the eldest son .
The remaining side rooms are for the ladies of the house and others - quite different from Portuguese architecture , " he says .
And the details of ornamentation , such as engravings , glasswork and wood carvings , are actually rendered in Qing - dynasty fashion .
The most representative example is Macau 's oldest church , Sao Paolo -LRB- the ruins of St. Paul 's -RRB- .
Its surviving stone facade is embellished with stone carvings not only of such Catholic images as angels and the Virgin Mary , but also of dragon - and - phoenix motifs and fishing boats , as well as Catholic phrases written in Chinese characters .
Marreiros believes that the hybrid culture of Macau is its greatest asset .
" Macau is so small .
It has no land for industry or agriculture .
All it has to rely on is intellect , " he says .
Three hundred years ago , missionaries in Macau built the first university in the Far East , the Jesuit College of St. Paul 's .
Since the 1980s , Macau has established six institutes of higher learning .
" Macau 's population is young , and the average educational level is quite high , " he notes .
Four hundred years of cultural intercourse between Occident and Orient has left behind enormous assets in Macau , and the enclave 's people have the ability to form a bridge of exchange between East and West .
Now that Macau 's sovereignty has switched hands , Marreiros has chosen not to return to his motherland of Portugal , but to remain behind .
" Macau is my home .
My heart is in Macau , " he says .
Marreiros is a person of Macau , part Portuguese and part Chinese .
A diversity of cultures will only enrich a person , not create a crisis of identity .
For Taiwanese people , who have questions about their own identity and often ask themselves who they are , what thoughts does Carlos Marreiros 's story bring to mind ?

New Rules for Tech Startups
-LRB- Cyril Chiang / graphics by Tsai Chih - pen / tr. by Jonathan Barnard -RRB-
In the past few years the Internet has helped to create a " new economy " that has both created technological fortunes and rewritten the postulates of traditional economic development .
Microsoft 's Bill Gates did n't make his money out of land or gold or oil , and he did n't make it from machines or factory goods .
Rather , what he had at his disposal was a method of organizing knowledge .
Precisely because entrepreneurs no longer need land or financial assets , the bar has never been lower for what is needed to build a successful company .
Yet it 's worth noting that the rate of success has also never been lower .
If you want to get investors to open their wallets in this new economic age , then you 've got to have a handle on some key points .
If investors ' eyes have n't brightened in three minutes , it 's all over .
Those hoping to build up a new company have got to know how to capture investors ' attention in the shortest possible time .
What is the right thing to say ?
How should you say it ?
The following 13 questions are what investors are most concerned about .
If you can focus on these 13 points of business startup logic and then add your own creative vision and arguments , then you 've probably taken your first step to success !
Question # 1 : How do you define your business ?
Successfully defining a business is a process of elimination .
In the late 1980s , Intel realized that it could no longer compete with Japanese semiconductor companies in the production of memory chips , so it left that market , believing that it would only be able to break free from Japanese competition by focusing on its specialty of microprocessors .
It is now a larger company many times over .
This is a story of how " loss " can turn into " gain . "
" Elimination " suggests paring down .
The more clearly a company is defined , the more limited will be its operational scope .
But just about any successful company has a clear sense of its limitations , because otherwise it would n't be able to differentiate itself in the marketplace and reduce its vulnerablility to price wars .
Consequently , it is essential to pay attention to the following points :
1. No matter how complex your company , it must have a basic conception that is clear and easy to understand .
2. The company 's definition is a reflection of its operational strategies .
3. An unclear company definition represents unclear operational strategies .
4. You 've got to clearly define your role based on the value of your products and services and get the consumer to understand what makes you better .
5. Differentiation is good and works to your advantage .
Question 2 : What is your executive summary ?
An executive summary serves as a preface to an investment or business plan .
It needs to faithfully reflect the special qualities and values of the entire plan in as few words as possible .
As far as investors are concerned , a clear , easy - to - read two - page summary is much better than a tedious 200 - page plan .
Steve Jurvetson , managing director of the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Draper , Fisher , and Jurvetson , says : " An executive summary is n't a financial contract ; it 's a story .
A story has to have drama and flesh - and - blood people .
For an executive summary , I 've never used Excel , and I 've never talked about models for the financial structure .
I always spend my time thinking about how big a story it could become . "
Therefore , you 've got to pay attention to the following :
1. The executive summary is the one chance you have to get investors interested in investing in your company .
2. Focus on selling your plan .
3. Get right to the point .
Do n't think of it as a literary competition .
4. In an orderly fashion , describe " the market , the management team , the finances and the technology . "
Question # 3 : What 's the justification for this business ?
The Japanese management guru Matsushita Konosuke has said , " Do n't sell customers things they find attractive , sell them things they find useful . "
Investors have a lot of different cards they can play , so they 've got to know why your business plan is worth pursuing .
Why now ?
Why you ?
Consequently , you must consider the following points :
1. Why should this be done ?
Why should you do it ?
Why now ?
2. The dollar sign -LRB- $ -RRB- is capitalism 's lingua franca .
3. The market will decide whether your plan is justifiable .
Question # 4 : How much risk are you willing to take on ?
Are you willing to risk failure ?
When you try to get people to invest in a new venture , there will invariably be one question that each and every one of those potential investors will have in mind :
" You want to put my money at risk , but what kind of risk are you taking ? "
Investors hope that the entrepreneur is taking equal risk , because only with commensurate risk will the two sides cooperate unselfishly .
Therefore , the entrepreneur must be very clear about the risk and the possibility of losing the investment .
What follows are the values of a Silicon Valley new - age knowledge - based business creator :
1. A failure is like the South in the American Civil War .
It 's history ; move on .
2. Those who have experience beat those who lack experience , and failure counts as experience .
3. Your past failure is your MBA from the school of hard knocks .
4. Failure is not rare or unusual .
You will only be successful by continuing to try .
You 've got to be careful about the following :
1. The investor and entrepreneur have to be taking similar risks if they are to cooperate selflessly .
2. Have you already put in time and money ?
3. Are you willing to forgo the security of a stable job and income ?
4. You can not pack a parachute and be thinking of a safe way to bail .
5. Having failed previously with startups does not mean a person is a loser .
Question # 5 : What are your company goals and business model ?
Morris Chang , chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor , believes that a company 's core staff ought to be on the same page .
They should share the same vision for the company and fit into its corporate culture .
The company goals should n't be pie - in - the - sky dreams .
Since the company has got to crystallize the investors ' and staff 's talents and energies , its vision for the future has to be attainable .
Apart from having a vision for the future , a company also needs a business model .
The business model is the way that the company plans to attain its goals .
A good business model can even realize visions of the future that seem impossible .
Priceline.com , the first American company to sell airline tickets directly over the Internet , surpassed the combined market capitalization of the three largest US airlines -LRB- United , American and Delta -RRB- after only two years of operations .
The three airlines have a total of 1,400 jets , whereas Priceline only has computers and network servers .
The key to its success was its business plan .
Therefore , you have to consider the following :
1. How do you outline where the company will be in three to five years ?
This is the company 's vision .
2. How do you realize the company 's vision ?
This is the business model .
3. The company 's vision is built on faith , and it requires the possibility of realization .
4. Once the company 's vision is defined , one should n't change it lightly .
The business model on the other hand can be constantly adapted in accordance with circumstances .
Question # 6 : How do you present your technology and service ?
Introducing the company 's technology to investors is something that the company founder should be very familiar with , but it is also is the source of conflicting feelings .
How should a founder of a start - up go about explaining its technology so that investors can understand it without getting so detailed as to reveal company secrets ?
Here are some recommendations :
1. You have to be able both to describe your innovation and protect your own intellectual property .
2. Do n't request a non-disclosure agreement , because this is unprofessional .
3. Investors are not intent on stealing your ideas .
Instead they want to see that you can justify them .
Question # 7 : What sort of problems do you want to solve ?
What problems is your company plan trying to solve ?
If you ca n't answer this clearly , then maybe you should be worrying about your future .
Taiwanese entrepreneurs are facing the problem of having an incomplete chain of value , which is a result of their customers handling the activities with the greatest added value .
This is a result of the problem , not its cause !
The real problem is that entrepreneurs in Taiwan do not make clear enough definitions when trying to resolve a problem , or they narrowly look at " manufacturing " as a way of solving the problem .
Raising one 's ability to innovate means raising one 's ability to solve problems .
This leads us to the following conclusions :
1. Finding a solution is finding a profitable market base .
2. You can only solve the problem by finding the problem .
3. Put your energies into solving today 's problems .
4. The problems created by your actions should not exceed the problems solved .
Question # 8 : Is the team complete ?
Who is missing ?
Founders of startups will always build their own management team , and they almost always start with people around them and then move on to attract personnel from outside .
This creates a blind spot in the structure , with like - minded people grouped together .
Investors like to hear entrepreneurs say that their teams are incomplete , because it shows that they have a practical mentality , and that they are aware of and willing to face their own shortcomings .
Good investors ought to maintain a mutually supportive relationship with the management team , but the investors are certainly not just the management team 's rubber stamp .
As a start - up founder , you ought to clearly understand that you are providing your knowledge and youth and the investors are providing their money .
The investors have no reason to want to handicap the entrepreneur .
In other words , there should be a supportive relationship between the investors and the management team , rather than an obstructive one .
We urge those who are creating a startup to understand where you come up short and be willing to ask for help .
Question # 9 : Where are your customers ?
How do you get hold of them ?
To answer this question , you 've got to focus on your " market segment . "
Secondly , you should analyze why customers in your market segment would like to do business with you .
You 've also got to consider how to prevent competitors from taking customers within the same market segment or how to effectively create entry barriers , so that you will be able to maintain a competitive advantage for as long as possible .
A price war is the simplest strategy , but consequently its effects are the most limited .
You should instead consider how to avoid the slippery slope of price wars .
What 's more , if you find that major changes in your sector are usually coming from other people 's customers , you should realize that they probably are n't your customers because they do n't need your products or can get something better .
To figure out why , you 've got to remind yourself to do the following :
1. Focus your attention on the market segment .
2. A good product or service will actively create a market segment and find customers that did n't previously exist .
3. Of course , any customer of yours sees some value in you .
How they value you determines their expectations of you .
4. Do n't forget about " non-customers . "
Do n't fall into the trap of thinking that you understand everything about the industry .
Question # 10 : Where are your competitors ?
Please do n't say that you have no competitors .
Perhaps you have no competitors today , but you will have them tomorrow .
And if you really do n't have weighty competitors , then your competitor is yourself .
Entry barriers and exit barriers have opposite effects .
The former determines if there will be a swarm of competitors .
-LRB- If entry barriers are low , anyone can compete . -RRB-
The latter determines whether there will be detrimental competition .
-LRB- If exit barriers are high , competitors will fight to the last penny . -RRB-
If you want to maintain core compet - itiveness , the first thing you 've got to do is to eliminate business that does not relate to your core competencies .
Furthermore , you should put the emphasis on innovation and strategic management .
Please remember :
1. When you analyze entry barriers , you should also analyze exit barriers .
2. You should focus on your " core competencies . "
3. You should use core personnel , develop core technology and attain core goals .
Question # 11 : What is your market share ?
In America telephones reached 90 % of households in 50 years , whereas it only took video recorders 18 years to do the same .
Today , new technological products and services are unlikely even to be around that long .
If technological entrepreneurs do not move forward , they fall behind .
Developing the company -LRB- and extremely fast at that -RRB- is a road that must be taken , and market share is an indication of the speed of the company 's development .
The " killer " strategy must combine " quickly changing the rules of the game " with management thinking that is characterized by a " willingness to take risks , " " unconventionality , " and " a determination to become the standard . "
Your determination as the founder of the company is all - important .
You 've got to pay attention to the following :
1. How should your company prepare to develop quickly ?
2. Not only must you advance technologically if you are not to fall behind , but you must also develop quickly .
3. There is a fine line between ambition and wishful thinking .
4. The underlying logic is more important than the results .
Question # 12 : When will you break even ?
How do you read financial clues ?
How do you transform your company ?
In the Internet economy , companies that are not among the leaders are going to have a rough go of it .
Therefore , merging -LRB- or being acquired -RRB- at the right price is more important than staying in business forever .
In order to prepare for a merger at any moment , financial officers must get used to the idea that " the company itself is its our biggest product . "
In the past , financial officers focused on cost management , cash flow , capital movement and risk avoidance .
From now on , looking at these wo n't be enough , and financial officers ought to turn their attention to mergers and raising capital .
If you want to raise capital , you 've got to explain how it is going to be used .
If you are going to pursue acquisitions , you have to evaluate assets .
Traditionally you raised capital in order to expand the scope of your business .
Internet companies , on the other hand , raise capital to increase the value of the company before acquiring or being acquired .
Value in the Internet economy is determined by the business model .
It is very possible that the a company will lack tangible assets upon which to evaluate worth .
As a result , " reading the value of the business plan " has to take the place of the traditional work of checking the books .
The value of the business model is in looking toward the future , not the present , and as a result most mergers take the form of stock swaps so as to preserve cash reserves .
In order to obtain the best rate of exchange , it is important to be traded on the market as soon as possible .
With this lack of clarity , " breaking even " becomes the ultimate financial indicator .
This series of changes has had a huge impact on financial officers .
The founder of a startup must :
1. Pay attention to cash and cash flow .
2. Forget about staying in business forever .
Be prepared at all times to sell the company for the highest profit .
Question # 13 : How should a startup entrepreneur handle communications and the media ?
Communication and media skills are certainly no less important than technology for a startup company .
The professional managers of listed companies frequently come face to face with non-professionals .
Speaking to the media is just one example .
With regard to communication and the media , the main things to do are to simplify and speak in language that your listeners will understand .
Excellent communicators first of all know how to " listen , " and secondly can think logically and learn quickly .
You 've got to take an open and objective attitude in order to understand the background of a question , and then respond by focusing on the questioner 's needs .
You must never force others to dance at your expert pace .
Do n't overestimate your listeners ' specialized knowledge , but do n't underestimate their general intelligence .
From the very beginning , founders of startups have got to get into the habit of :
1. Cultivating explanation skills , so that you can explain specialized knowledge to non-specialists and they can get the gist .
2. Practicing how best to communicate .
Citing a good example is usually the best way to explain something .
Guy Kawasaki , founder of Garage.com , the largest US company focusing on attracting venture capital for startups , has long been famous in Silicon Valley for his entrepreneurial enthusiasm .
In a speech he delivered in the US in May he outlined the main points in his vision of new - age entre - preneurialism :
In the 19th century , companies in the ice business would send people to frozen lakes or rivers to saw up the ice .
These companies were replaced by ice making factories .
Then refrigerators replaced ice factories .
If these businessmen had embraced change instead of resisting it , they would have had an opportunity to move into a new technological field - rather than just watching helplessly as others took over what was once their domain .
Change is the only constant on the way to success !
Minister of Transportation and Communications
Yeh Chu - lan

Raised in a Hakka village in Miaoli County , Yeh Chu - lan , a graduate of the law department at Fu - Jen Catholic University , is the new Minister of Transportation and Communications , overseeing 120,000 employees and an annual budget of over NT$ 400 billion .
From her early career in advertising , to taking up her late husband 's unfulfilled wishes and setting out on the road of political no - return , Yeh Chu - lan has fought impressively , earning wide acclaim .
What makes Yeh , having tasted the sweetness and sorrow of life in equal portions , able to switch roles with such aplomb ?
And where does the soft - spoken yet resolute Yeh find the strength to handle the mounting challenges that life has thrust upon her ?
If not for the self - immolation of her late husband , Cheng Nan - jung , Yeh would not have gotten involved in politics .
Since running for legislator in 1989 , Yeh Chu - lan 's approach to politics for over a decade has been to " do things for Taiwan . "
With the election of Chen Shui - bian to the presidency , she says she feels that the DPP 's transitional mission has been accomplished .
However , at the repeated invitation of both President Chen and Premier Tang Fei to " write history for Taiwanese democracy , " Yeh was moved by their sense of mission and accepted the appointment as new Minister of Transportation and Communications .
Delicate and soft on the outside , strong and tough on the inside , Yeh Chu - lan 's confidence and tenacity are well illustrated by her love story .
After commencing university at the age of 18 , she met fellow philosophy student Cheng Nan - jung .
Her family 's eldest girl , she disregarded her father 's objections and insisted on marrying Cheng .
For a short period after graduating from university she returned to teach in Miaoli , but in order to be together with Cheng Nan - jung she returned north to look for work in Taipei .
Starting in an advertising agency as an account assistant , she climbed straight up the ranks to become the highest - ranking female executive in Taiwan 's advertising industry , impressing colleagues with her competence and talents .
Far more than a pinch - hitter
From career woman to professional legislator , Yeh 's metamorphosis was clear for her colleagues to see .
In " Looking Back , " a documentary on women in Taiwanese politics that was filmed with support from the DPP 's Department of Women 's Affairs , the late DPP women 's affairs director Peng Wan - ju made an acute observation about Yeh :
Although it was her husband 's lingering shadow that took her into politics , Yeh 's performance has gone beyond the traditional experiences of women in opposition politics , transcending the image of a victimized family member to manifest the autonomy of a female political figure in her own right .
Peng commented : " During her first term as a legislator she acted a lot like a substitute , so every time she questioned officials or addressed a session she would say that such and such was communicated to her in a dream by Cheng Nan - jung .
However , by her second and third terms , she came very much into her own , and she won great respect from women 's groups as a defender of women 's interests and a champion of the family dependents ' section of the civil law . "
At the recent Yangmingshan seminar for new government officials , Yeh Chu - lan gave a short interview , stressing , " When I first ran for office I was not playing the role of a housewife pinch - hitting for her husband .
I was already an influential female executive in my professional field .
And even though I went into politics due to my husband 's sacrifice , I was only willing to do so because I shared his beliefs .
My objective was to fight as a mother for what I hold dearest .
As a public servant , I have always been my own person . "
In over a decade in politics , Yeh Chu - lan 's exhaustive efforts on the part of women 's groups are worth tallying .
The revision of the family dependents ' section of the civil law was a major undertaking , with a mind - boggling number of legal provisions touching on highly complex issues .
Long - term efforts by women 's groups , plus the personal crusades of Yeh and New Party legislator Hsieh Chi - ta , ultimately built momentum in the Legislative Yuan .
Finally , after exhaustive lobbying of the Executive Yuan , the Legislative Yuan passed the revision of certain provisions of the family dependents ' section of the civil law in 1996 , providing safeguards for Taiwanese women 's prenuptial property rights and child custody rights .
This proved to be the first major step for equal rights between the sexes under law .
Respect for expertise
Variously described by the media as a crusader for justice , a hard worker and an incorruptible political figure , Yeh Chu - lan , known as " mother of the country , " carries considerable seniority within the DPP .
Her aggressive efforts to shore up the Hakka vote for Chen Shui - bian during the presidential election were also crucial to her appointment as Minister of Transportation and Communications .
On the other hand , the media also notes that Yeh has practically no past connections to the Ministry of Transportation and Communications , and the ministry 's complex , specialized tasks present her with a steep learning curve .
Addressing these issues , Yeh relates , " The Ministry of Transportation and Communications , in a word , is about ' people , ' making it essentially a huge service network .
With this in mind , setting out from the standpoint of ' people ' is the first task I have set out for myself . "
In addition , she stresses that due to the excessive burdens of the old administration , in which policies were constantly distorted by personal interests and party considerations , perhaps professionals in the Ministry of Transportation and Communications were frustrated at being unable to put their expertise into play .
" People want the new government to quell the old never - ending conflicts over individual interests , and draw a line between public administration and politics .
These are the biggest issues faced by the new cabinet .
Now is the chance to clear out the cobwebs and get off to a new start . "
A Date with Destiny -- Presidential Candidates Woo the Voters
Four years ago , amidst the tense atmosphere of the first - ever direct elections for the nation 's leader in Chinese history , issues of ethnicity and ideology became focal points .
The crisis sparked by PRC missile tests pushed the security of Taiwan to the top of the issue list , and the ticket of Lee Teng - hui and Lien Chan of the ruling Kuomintang , which promised stability , won the election with 54 % of the vote .
In this year 's presidential election , cross-strait policy is still an important subject .
But none of the five candidates is advocating Taiwan independence , and , among the three main contenders , there is a race for the center .
All three have proposed ideas to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait :
Lien Chan has proposed a " Taiwan Strait zone of peace , " James Soong has advocated the signing of a peace treaty with the mainland , and Chen Shui - bian has announced that if elected he will not declare Taiwan independent nor seek to have the " two states formula " inserted in the constitution .
In 1996 , President Lee Teng - hui was far ahead of his rivals all the way , and the election was lopsided .
This year , the most prominent feature of the campaign is exactly the opposite :
The three main candidates are running neck - and - neck , and the election battle is fierce .
It is impossible right now to say who might win , and will probably remain so right up to the finish .
With all the candidates having largely similar views on cross-strait relations , what issues will be decisive ?
Candidates can play the stability card , the bull - market card , the serve - the - people card , the personal charisma card , and so on , but which one of these will prove to be the trump card ?
Taking advantage of the Chinese New Year , many Taiwan businessmen working in the PRC returned to Taiwan to spend the holiday with their families .
Just after the new year , the Mainland Affairs Council and several non-governmental groups co-sponsored a seminar on economic relations with mainland China .
They invited a number of Taiwan businessmen who were among the earliest to invest in the PRC to come to the seminar and relate their experiences .
At this event , there was virtually no mention of the election .
The participants were far more concerned about choosing investment sites , hiring mainland personnel , and understanding customs regulations .
You could privately ask them : Is there likely to be any change in the cross-strait situation after the election of a new leader ?
Will the election affect willingness to invest in the PRC ?
But you would only get responses like : " Let 's not talk politics , " or " Everyone is seeking stability , and there wo n't be much of a change . "
Most of the businessmen expressed optimism that after the entry of the PRC and Taiwan into the World Trade Organization later this year , relations between the two sides would steadily improve .
A terrifying topic ?
Maintaining peaceful relations across the Taiwan Strait is the common hope of the vast majority of the people of Taiwan .
When you talk about 21st century leadership in Taiwan , cross-strait policy is the most serious subject that politicians must face , because it involves the very survival of Taiwan .
" However , because this subject touches on the question of the ' loyalty ' of the candidates toward Taiwan , it has become a terrifying topic for them , " says Wang Chien - chuang , president of The Journalist magazine and a longtime observer of political development in Taiwan .
By looking at the carefully worded statements of the various candidates , he says , it is clear that they are all afraid of being accused of " selling out Taiwan . "
The only exception is the fringe candidate Li Ao , who is well - known for shooting from the hip .
Unafraid of criticism that he is " betraying Taiwan , " he has publicly endorsed the PRC 's policy of " one country , two systems . "
The other minor candidate , Hsu Hsin - liang , set the foundations for his mainland policy as early as ten years ago when he wrote a book on his theory of a " newly rising people . "
But neither of these views conform to mainstream values , and these candidates are getting little support .
What about the three main candidates ?
Chen Shui - bian of the Democratic Progressive Party , which advocates Taiwan independence , produced a long and detailed white paper on China policy , which offered some changes and reservations to the independence position .
But , in an unguarded moment , Chen also declared " Long live Taiwan 's independent sovereignty ! " and this comment has left many people uncertain which is the real Chen .
Independent candidate
James Soong has suggested defining Taiwan - PRC links as a " quasi-international relationship . "
This aims for a middle ground between the KMT 's " two states formula " and the PRC 's " one country , two systems " that will appeal to Taiwan , mainland China , and the international community .
But this idea has been criticized for unilaterally reducing Taiwan to the status of a " quasi-country , " thereby weakening Taiwan 's status and bargaining power vis - a - vis the mainland .
Lien Chan , candidate of the ruling KMT , is somewhat bound to support the government 's " two states formula . "
After much consideration , his mainland policy has been framed as working toward the middle stage of the National Reunification Guidelines - in other words , attempting to re-establish official channels of communication between the two sides of the strait .
" No one dares be different from the others on mainland policy , " says Wang Chien - chuang .
This is because over the past few years a consensus has taken shape in Taiwan society on policy toward mainland China : " Taiwan first . "
No one has the ability to alter this consensus .
The candidates can merely haggle over details of policy , such as differences over the scope or timing of liberalization of the " three direct links " -LRB- direct trade , direct transport , and direct mail -RRB- .
Alexander Lu , a professor of political science at National Taiwan University , agrees with the no - major - innovations approach of the three candidates .
As he sees it , since currently there are three candidates with a roughly equal share of the vote , whoever wins will probably not get more than 50 % .
As a result , there will be a great deal of countervailing pressure against radical change .
Concludes Lu : " Policy will tend to be centrist , and any steps taken will be small . "
He adds , " Taiwan is a pluralistic society , and if you want to attract many types of voters , you ca n't be too outspoken about policy .
This is because extreme clarity does n't make much difference to those who already support you , but it could cost you undecided votes . "
Local issues , national results
Mainland policy is a minefield , but it is the foundation for all other policies , and no candidate can ignore it .
However , this does not mean , say Wang and Lu , that it will be a decisive factor in the election .
" There is a very curious aspect to Taiwan 's electoral culture , " explains Wang .
Taiwan is small , and voters do not clearly distinguish between the roles of the head of state , elected legislators , and government bureaucrats .
No matter how high the office , for many voters , especially in traditional constituencies , " all politics is local . "
For them , what matters is whether a politician seems concerned about their hometown issues .
That is why when Chen Shui - bian went to Sanhsia in Taipei County , he talked about a pension for the elderly , and when Lien Chan went to Kaohsiung he talked about establishing a science - based industrial park there .
These parochial issues are the real keys to the election .
Next in importance is the candidate 's character , including charisma , leadership style , and attitude in dealing with incidents that come up during the campaign .
In this campaign , James Soong has been at the center of much controversy over the character issue .
The issues that surround him can be traced back to his more than two decades near the top in Taiwan political life .
Kuo Shu - min of the China Times Express , a longtime observer of the KMT , says that controversy over James Soong goes back to the days when the KMT ruled over Taiwan and repressed all opposition .
When Soong was KMT secretary - general , he was powerful and aloof ; the only way to get an interview with him was to block his car as it left party headquarters .
During the struggle in the KMT between the mainstream and the non-mainstream factions , Soong played a vital role in consolidating the position of President Lee Teng - hui .
In clearing out many obstacles on behalf of Lee , he incurred the wrath of many party elders , who considered him to be Lee 's " running dog . "
Soong is especially good at timing .
He knows what to say and when , in order to attract the most attention .
Kuo recalls several such opportune moments when Soong was provincial governor .
For example , he criticized the KMT center over the symbolic status assigned to the provincial governor at cabinet meetings , and also over unfairness in the division of government revenues .
His media skills were such that " he only had to open his mouth and he would be the headline on page one or two . "
Although opinions are divided about Soong , Kuo affirms one thing :
He has had to be very determined in order to transform his image from that of a skilled party infighter from a high - ranking family to that of a populist who understands the people .
Says Kuo , " If Lee Teng - hui is a Taiwanese opera performer , then James Soong is a Peking opera actor - Soong 's moves are refined down to the last detail . "
For example , when the KMT was trying to persuade elder National Assembly members to retire , Soong met with them all individually .
During his five years as governor , he visited each of the 309 towns and rural townships in Taiwan .
In this presidential election , at any event with a crowd , he wants to shake the hand of everyone there ; he believes that he can tell from the handshake alone whether he has that person 's vote .
Gold cup and plain water
In contrast to Soong and Chen Shui - bian , who have been through previous election battles and have distinct public identities , " Lien Chan is n't really a man of the people .
He does n't like to have the spotlight on him , he does n't think of himself as a star , and he does n't want to put on a show . "
But , says Wang Chien - chuang , it is debatable whether a politician really needs to have the common touch .
Compare Taiwan to the US .
Lee Teng - hui is similar to Bill Clinton , who has a personal charisma that moves people .
Lien Chan , on the other hand , is more like Al Gore , and has always been somewhat aloof from average citizens .
Says Wang Chien - chuang , " Lien Chan is like plain water in a gold cup . "
He 's been in government for more than 20 years , serving as minister of transportation and communications , foreign minister , Taiwan provincial governor , premier , and vice president .
" Yet still most citizens do not have a very strong impression of him .
This is really a strange situation . "
Chen Feng - hsin , a reporter for the United Daily News , writes in the authorized biography 100 % Lien Chan that a large part of the reason Lien appears to be unapproachable is because of the way he has come across on TV .
Lien himself says that , after more than 20 years in appointive positions , he has developed a stern mien .
Moreover , his appearances on television have often been at confrontational interpellation sessions in front of the legislature or the provincial assembly , so that his warmer side does not come across .
A little story in the book relates something of his sense of humor .
Lien was born in Xi'an in mainland China , and his first primary school was called the Zuo Xiu school .
Because of the war , he transferred out after only one year .
The name of the school actually was an abbreviation for a term meaning " to educate and cultivate . "
But in contemporary Taiwan , coincidentally , the characters zuo xiu mean " to put on a show " or " market yourself . "
Lien often jests , " It 's because I never graduated from ' Make a Show ' primary school that I 'm in the spot I 'm in today . "
Political writer Hsia Chen says that when Lien was foreign minister , he laid the foundations of pragmatic diplomacy , and allowed Kuo Wan - jung to attend the Asian Development Bank annual conference in Beijing .
After Lee Teng - hui came to power , Lee went through a series of battles with successive premiers :
Lien is the only one who has had a harmonious working relationship with the president .
Hsia says that Lien 's political character tends to be easy - going and generous , he can comfortably delegate authority , and he is calm under pressure .
Local boy makes good
Compared to Lien Chan , who comes from a wealthy family , Chen Shui - bian , who is an entirely self - made man , makes a marked contrast .
After starting his career as a lawyer , Chen acted as defense counsel for arrested opposition leaders , and then served several terms as a legislator , making a name for himself as a standout leader of the opposition .
He won the mayorship of the capital city of Taipei back in 1994 , and , step by step , has become the most popular figure in the DPP .
As a legislator , Chen was a sharp questioner of government officials , but he had a little trouble adjusting to being an executive official himself .
As Taipei mayor , his decisiveness won many plaudits , but his manner was often perceived as overbearing and this led to frozen relations with the city council .
" Chen fulfilled most of the promises he made in his campaign , but he did n't give much attention to procedural concerns , " says Wang Chien - chuang .
For example , he adopted a curfew for young people virtually unilaterally .
As Wang puts it : " Perhaps Chen would say that many problems in Taipei had reached a point calling for decisive action , but whether efficiency is more important than consultation is an eternally debatable question . "
A group of 33 education reform advocacy organizations rated the five candidates on their views on education reform .
On the question , " Does the candidate have a grasp of the key problems in education reform in Taiwan ? "
Chen and Hsu Hsin - liang were given top marks .
" Chen dares to talk about the cost of reform , " says Ting Chih - jen , director of one of these education reform groups .
Everybody knows the education system must be reformed , but reform costs money .
" Chen Shui - bian dares to talk about the problem of paying the bill . "
However , though Chen says he will ask the legislature to guarantee the necessary financing , he does not , as Hsu Hsin - liang does , guarantee that he will spend 6 % of GDP on education .
" He 's not clear enough , " says Ting , who opines that Chen thinks that he can wait until he 's elected before he decides how much money to spend .
Overall , " Chen is good at finding the weaknesses in others ' policies , but not as good at facing up to questions when he is in power .
It may be easy to become the emperor , but to win the people 's hearts requires concrete action . "
Pork barrel politics
As for James Soong , " His policies are more for helping the weak , and give more thought to the poor . "
Soong has taken into account the long - existing disparity between state - funded and private secondary schools in Taiwan -LRB- private schools are much more expensive , though they merely provide the same education as the state schools -RRB- .
His platform includes subsidies to assist the children of low - income families who attend private secondary schools .
Ting admits that in evaluating education platforms , the incumbent , Lien Chan , is at a relative disadvantage , because the policies currently being implemented are open to immediate scrutiny .
According to Ting , " Lien Chan has been at odds with the education community for a long time . "
Reformers are most disappointed that the education budget has been seriously squeezed these past few years , falling by as much as NT$ 40 billion in a single year .
" Lien is also the candidate who is most likely to believe that problems can be solved by throwing money at them , " says Ting .
Lien has stated that he wants to extend compulsory education from 9 to 12 years , and to offer vouchers for pre-school and private secondary education .
These would all place tremendous strain on the already overstretched education budget .
The government debt is currently NT$ 2.6 trillion , ten times higher than a decade ago ; if these promised education " checks " were actually cashed , the debt would pass NT$ 3 trillion .
Ting concludes : " He has lost his direction in terms of education policy , and he underestimates the education community .
He thinks he just has to promise to throw money around and then he 'll have people persuaded . "
Educators are not looking to be a burden on the country ; all they want is that the government stop squeezing the existing budget smaller and smaller .
In fact , the " checks " candidates write are closely connected to their assumptions about the roles governments should play .
" Just as wool grows on a sheep , if the government role expands , it will require ever greater resources , " says Wu Hui - lin , a researcher at the Chung Hua Institution for Economic Research .
As an economist , Wu advocates the free market and thinks that the government 's effectiveness should not be overrated .
For example , large - scale government encouragement of high - tech industry has contributed to an imbalance in the industrial structure .
The stock market is an even more obvious example :
From the Securities and Exchange Commission to the Ministry of Finance to the proposed Stock Stabilization Fund , you can see the government 's shadow everywhere .
" The government should go back to just playing a referee role , and do that well , " Wu avers .
This applies to economic relations with the PRC as well , Because wherever there are controls there will be speculation
This applies to economic relations with the PRC as well .
Laws ca n't cover everything , and always leave gray areas , so that " influential persons are positioned to undertake quasi-legal activities with impunity .
The government should not be creating special opportunities for the private profit of certain individuals . "
Wu believes the market should be left to itself .
Improvement , not change
However , others have the opposite view .
Some believe that Taiwan 's market is too affected by non-economic factors , so the government must play a protective role .
There has long been debate in Taiwan over the relative importance of the market and government intervention .
But it can not be overlooked that one major reason Taiwan is now the world 's 12th largest trading nation is because government policy has fostered economic prosperity .
J.T. Day , chairman of the National Association of Small and Medium Enterprises of the ROC , avers , " Taiwan needs to improve , but does not need to change . "
Democratic reform in Taiwan in recent years has come about without the shedding of a single drop of blood ; this is an amazing accomplishment .
" Our house is already built .
Perhaps it is not perfect , and needs some renovation , but is it really necessary to tear it down and start again ? "
Ten years ago , the total annual value of Taiwan 's imports and exports was NT$ 50 billion .
Today that figure is NT$ 200 billion , a four-fold increase .
Day asks : " If Taiwan were not a good business environment , why would big corporations bring their second generation back from abroad to take over ?
In this era of globalization , they could simply let their children stay overseas ! "
He argues that Taiwan was the country least affected by the Asian financial crisis because the government handled the situation well .
He gives the government 's economic cabinet a grade of 98 .
He is worried that if someone other than the ruling party candidate wins the election , the new economic officials might not be as capable .
Governing is different
Wang Chien - chuang states : " All candidates have beautiful - sounding platforms , because this is a presidential election , and they must have a blueprint for governing the nation .
But running for office and running the country are two very different things . "
It has been said , " campaigning is like poetry , governing is like an essay . "
In writing a poem , one can create a coherent and highly refined work .
But it is only actual governing that tests one 's true staying power .
Scholars have stated that the 2000 election in Taiwan has three special characteristics :
For one thing , this is the first time the opposition has a very real possibility of taking the reins of government .
Secondly , the three leading candidates are so close it is impossible to tell who will win .
And third , whatever the outcome , this is the beginning of Taiwan 's post-strongman era .
In this new era , says Wang , new standards for leadership are needed .
The national leader must be more than just a local politico writ large .
Wang gives his personal analysis of the pros and cons for the three candidates :
Chen Shui - bian is the person who brings the most hope and vitality , because his policies would be clearly different from those of the KMT .
But his biggest problem is " instability " - not personal instability , but policy instability .
For example , sometimes he seems opposed to allowing PRC firms to invest in Taiwan , sometimes in favor ; sometimes he seems against the opening of direct links with the mainland , sometimes not .
James Soong is very capable , but his very success may be his weak point .
He is often very proud of himself because his provincial administration built a bridge or aqueduct to meet the needs of ordinary people .
But , ancient Chinese governing wisdom criticizes those who " accomplish a small feat and think they can do anything , or discover a trivial idea and think they are brilliant . "
Lien Chan offers stability above all .
But he carries a heavy burden .
Lien must face up to the fact that his party has been governing in Taiwan for 50 years , and people want change .
Even if he wins , this may mean only that the people of Taiwan are willing to give Lien Chan a chance , and would not necessarily be an endorsement of the KMT itself .
Peace as a weapon
What kinds of challenges face the next leader of Taiwan ?
Public opinion surveys show that voters are most concerned about crime and the economy .
In a February survey conducted by the United Daily News , the number of citizens very concerned about crime was 31 % , eleven percentage points higher than four years ago .
Roughly the same percentage said they were most concerned about problems of finance and the economy .
Early this year Commonwealth magazine asked citizens , " What do you think is the first thing the new president should do after taking office ? "
The results show that the people of Taiwan believe that the most urgent problems are crime , " black gold politics " -LRB- the confluence of organized crime , moneyed interests , and corrupt politicians -RRB- , and raising economic competitiveness .
Senior journalist Chu Sung - chiu says that all three major candidates say they are opposed to black gold politics .
But citizens want more than slogans , they want effective action .
Political scientist Alexander Lu says that the crux of the issue is resoluteness .
If the resolve was there , it would not be that difficult to reduce crime and corruption .
Ting Chih - jen says , " Crime is rising fastest among youth . "
He argues that education is in fact the best crime - fighting policy :
" If students can enjoy a happy learning environment at school , then society will no longer be sitting on a powderkeg . "
Ting says that , although education is not a panacea , it is certainly not irrelevant .
Unfortunately , the effects of education policy are visible only in the long term , and it therefore has a relatively weak position in politics and is often neglected because policymakers probably will not see the fruits of their efforts in their terms of office .
But the main industries of the 21st century , such as the information and telecommunications industries , are knowledge - based .
If education is done well , the benefits will spread to many other areas .
The greatest variable for Taiwan society remains the other side of the Taiwan Strait .
" In the past two years , Taiwan has been continually testing where mainland China will draw the line in cross-strait relations , " says social critic Nan Fang Shuo .
But playing word games over how to define the relationship is simply a way of hiding from the problem , ostrich - like , as the situation deteriorates .
Fortunately the three main candidates have committed themselves to a moderate path .
Right now there 's a choice between peace and war in cross-strait relations .
The most important challenge for Taiwan now is to transcend the old mentalities of cold war anti-communism and Taiwan independence , and to build a new logic of peace .
Taiwan 's future is now in the hands of its voters .
Cracking Down on Black Gold
-LRB- Teng Sue - fen / tr. by Christopher MacDonald -RRB-
At the end of December there was an - other piece of good news concerning the new government 's crackdown on crime .
Fugitive Huang Wen - chung , wanted for complicity in the slaying of former Kaohsiung County Council speaker Wu Ho - sung , was arrested in Phuket after a two - year investigation and with the cooperation of the Thai police authorities .
And a month earlier the Executive Yuan handed the legislature a draft amendment to the Election and Recall Law that is designed to block mob - affiliated individuals from running for public office .
It is hoped that the combination of executive and legislative measures will finally drive " black gold " out of Taiwanese politics .
Cracking down on crime and stamping out " black gold " politics remains a central plank of the new government 's platform .
On December 15 the Ministry of Justice released the results of the first six months of its campaign against black gold -LRB- i.e. collusion among politicians , crime syndicates and big business -RRB- .
In the period up to December 10 , prosecutors around Taiwan dealt with more than 2,000 cases concerning black - gold offenses , brought charges against 30 elected officials and representatives , and found over NT$ 2.59 billion in misappropriated public funds .
The following cases , currently under investigation , have attracted particular attention : the alleged involvement of Linkou mayor Tsai Tzung - yi , Yingko Township chief Hsu Yuan - ho and Linkou council deputy chairman Chou Yeh - feng in the operation of an illegal waste dump at a disused brickyard ; alleged fraud by Nantou County commissioner Peng Pai - hsien in connection with construction projects ; allegations of corruption against Hsinchu mayor Tsai Jen - chien ; and the suspected embezzlement of post-921 earthquake relief funds by Hsinchu municipal council speaker Cheng Cheng - kuang .
Cases in which charges have already been brought include : the alleged misuse of public funds for overseas trips by Miaoli County commissioner Fu Hsueh - peng , along with county councilors Lo Hsing - chun and Hsieh Ching - chuan ; alleged breaches of the Securities Transaction Law by leading brokerage owner You Hwai - yin ; alleged financial fraud by national legislator Lin Jui - tu ; and alleged corruption by Tainan mayor George Chang in connection with a canal dredging project .
On December 6 the Executive Yuan passed a draft amendment to the Public Officials Election and Recall Law , tightening the criteria for those seeking public office so as to prevent mob affiliates from securing legal immunity as elected representatives .
Under the new provisions , anyone convicted and sentenced to jail under the Organized Crime Statute is barred for life from seeking election to an official post , while those indicted for a capital offence or for crimes carrying sentences of ten years or more are barred pending the verdict of the court .
Political parties become liable for the records of their candidates and face fines of NT$ 500,000 to NT$ 5 million if they nominate candidates who have prior convictions for electoral fraud or election violence .
These revisions to the law will immediately affect a number of parliamentary incumbents , including legislators Kuo Ting - tsai and Wu Tze - yuan , both of whom face disqualification from re-election .
The new provisions have received cross-party support in the legislature , though some deputies want further consultation concerning the exclusion from elections of those charged with but not yet convicted of the relevant offences , as this may deprive them unfairly of their rights .
Ho Chih - hui , secretary - general of the KMT caucus in the legislature , says that the party supports barring those convicted of involvement in organized crime from public office , but feels that the Executive Yuan needs to clarify just what " involvement " constitutes in this context .
Also , at the end of December and after much consultation within the opposition alliance , a preliminary agreement was reached on the draft amendment to the Farmers ' and Fishermen 's Associations Law , which has been under lengthy review in the legislature .
According to the agreement , restrictions on those seeking association membership and sub-committee posts will be relaxed , but the rules will be tightened for those running for the posts of director or general secretary , excluding or removing from office anyone who is in default for more than a year on loans from these and other such financial organizations .
However , the amendment remains stuck in the legislative queue for the time being .
In addition to the Ministry of Justice , the Criminal Investigation Bureau has also scored some successes in the past few months in its campaign against crime syndicates .
In early November the leader of the Four Seas Gang , Yang Kuang - nan , who had been arrested in Shanghai by mainland authorities , was transferred to Taiwanese custody in the transit lounge at Macau Airport and brought back to Taiwan for questioning .
Yang had fled to the mainland in November 1997 , after a warrant was issued for his arrest in connection with a loan - shark operation , and has been a key target for the police ever since .
Good news has also been coming in from local prosecutors ' offices around Taiwan .
Prosecutors in Taitung have been investigating county councilors for alleged corruption involving public grants and construction projects , and after half a year of the investigation 19 representatives have been indicted , including the current speaker and deputy speaker of the county council , along with 41 members of the previous two sessions of the council .
This sets a judicial record for the number of elected representatives facing charges in a single case .
Meanwhile , prosecutors in Changhua have been investigating electoral fraud from the time of the presidential election , and are seeking sentences of two months to three years for over 200 people , including the head of Yuanlin Township , for breaking the Election and Recall Law .
The Ministry of Justice has achieved a measure of success so far in its crackdown on black gold , but in order to win public support it has had to stress to investigators the need to observe due process and respect suspects ' rights .
The ministry has also required prosecutors to use discretion when collecting evidence about suspected financial impropriety by officials - for which there is a low rate of conviction - so as not to obstruct the work of civil servants or damage their morale .
New - found Fame : Three Cyber-authors Dealing with Success
-LRB- Eric Lin / photo courtesy of Red Ink Publishing / tr. by Christopher MacDonald -RRB-
Cyber-literature has become a publishing phenomenon , with teenage readers idolizing its star authors : writers such as Tsai Chih - heng - who set the ball rolling with his first cyber-novel and is known online as " Slicker Tsai " - along with Chi Chi , and Shuang - tzu .
How do these authors , whose literary apprenticeship has differed so much from that of other , more traditional authors , view the business of writing ?
" Dunno , " is what cyber-authors mostly reply when asked why their works have generated so much interest both in cyberspace and in the conventional publishing trade .
Tsai Chih - heng , whose online work The First Intimate Contact became a bookstore bestseller , elaborates a little : " It 's probably just the luck of the draw . "
Tsai released The First Intimate Contact on the web in 1998 , while reading for his doctorate at National Cheng Kung University 's Department of Hydraulics and Ocean Engineering .
He began by posting the story - based on his own love - life - in installments on a BBS , as a distraction from the pressure of writing his thesis .
" The First Intimate Contact was my first novel , " says Tsai .
" I had posted a few smaller pieces on the web before , in a similar vein , but with my scientific background I never considered myself literary material .
All I was trying to do was write down my own story in novel form . "
Tsai 's approach is to write about personal experience , with a touch of imagination thrown in .
" At first I had no intention of finishing the thing , " says Tsai candidly .
" But after a few installments the readers wanted more , and there was pressure to continue .
Eventually I put aside my doctoral thesis for a month or so and drilled off the rest of the novel . "
Tsai acknowledges that because of the immediacy of the medium his online work is to some degree influenced , in terms of form , content and progress , by the response of the readers - " even if a lot of that influence is unconscious . "
The author of Sunny Doll , Chi Chi , has a similar experience .
" Sunny Doll was surprisingly popular after just a few postings , and the enthusiastic response from readers made me anxious to finish the story as soon as possible .
This probably explains the rather slapdash ending , " says Chi Chi .
Of course there are also those like Shuang - tzu , author of Worn - Out Socks , who remain unfazed by readers ' reactions .
In Shuang - tzu 's case , this reflects her experience as the administrator of a BBS site .
" The administrator is an impartial observer who does n't get involved in the online discussion , so I learned not to be easily swayed by what is being said , " says Shuang - tzu .
As she points out , however , online stories are often posted several at a time , or abandoned half way through when their authors find themselves too busy for writing .
" It took only a month and a half to write Worn - Out Socks , but before that I spent a year and a half on another novel , Departed Soul , " says Shuang - tzu .
For her , the biggest source of pressure as a writer is the obligation to " finish . "
In order to reduce this pressure she starts with a disclaimer :
" Do n't ask me how it 's progressing .
If you do n't see any more installments then maybe there wo n't be any more . "
Most cyber-authors are used to writing directly online , which inevitably makes for some clunky sentences and continuity breaks .
Revisions are always needed before online works can be turned into real books , but the writers are still happy writing the way they do at present .
" I wo n't change the way I release my work , " says Chi Chi , " because it was the web environment that got me writing in the first place . "
Tsai Chih - heng and Shuang - tzu feel the same way .
So far , the critical reception for cyber-literature in book form has not been great , as Tsai Chih - heng and Chi Chi both bear in mind .
Says Tsai : " The success is just a matter of good luck .
I 'll still do what I originally wanted to do - teach at university - and I 'll write as much as I feel I need to . "
On the other hand , Shuang - tzu , who graduated in Chinese literature from Hua Fan University , does have literary ambitions .
" I do n't want to categorize my own works , just so long as they are ' understandable . '
I 'm interested in writing bona fide literature , but writing is n't going to be my main profession because I know that economic pressures can get in the way of natural creativity . "
In cyber-literature , casual writing , endless dialogue and wacky goings - on are the norm .
If someone writes it , someone else will read it .
As to the literary merits of the form and whether it will determine the course for literature in the coming century , that 's not something that unduly concerns the cyber-authors .
As Tsai Chih - heng , Chi - chi and Shuang - tzu all agree , regardless of fame , they themselves are still free spirits in cyberspace .
Internet Pioneer Heidi Hsueh
When the Internet started to take off in Taiwan in 1995 , Inforian was one of the first Taiwan Internet startups .
In the years since it has made quite a splash in the industry .
Back when the Internet in Taiwan mainly meant college students posting on bulletin boards and fooling around with Mosaic , a 23 - year - old graduate student at National Chengchi University named Heidi Hsueh and a graduate student at National Taiwan University named Lawrence Ho decided to form an Internet company together .
They started with just NT$ 500,000 .
Hsueh , who speaks with all the self - confidence of a prophet , recalls that she could early on see the tremendous impact that the Internet was going to have on people s lives .
" We were riding that first wave , " says Hsueh , who points out that deciding to strike at the right time is the first step to success .
Starting with books
In the early period , Inforian - or pAsia as it is known today - made money by publishing books and by localizing software for the Taiwan market .
Hsueh , the co-founder and executive vice president , ca n't count how many times she stayed up all night at the office in those early days .
Once , when their distributor for some reason refused to make payments , they had to endure two months without any incoming revenue .
" When you 're considering founding a company , " she says , issuing a warning to the many youths throwing themselves into Internet startups , " you 've really got to consider carefully the pressures you 're going to be under . "
The division of labor was clear from the start .
Ho was responsible for product design , and Hsueh handled business development and marketing strategy .
After two years , the company had its first success : the IQ97 -LRB- Inforian Quest -RRB- meta - search engine .
It hit a homerun for their Internet dreams .
Not long after Ho finished IQ97 , Hsueh sent it to the American website ZDNet , which awarded it five stars , its highest rating .
Hsueh then used the Internet to find distributors around the world .
Soon IQ97 had been translated into seven languages and plans were laid to step into the global market .
Within a year of the product 's release in October of 1997 , it had sold three million copies worldwide .
Inforian followed by launching CICQ , a Chinese language instant messaging site that attracted 1 million members from around the world .
Then in 1998 it focused on e-commerce , establishing the online auction site CoolBid , which has averaged quarterly sales of NT$ 60 million and has as many as 100,000 members .
Hsueh also made plans to forge alliances with world - famous companies .
In 1998 , after seeing Hsueh 's strategic alliance plan , Intel joined Inforian as a strategic partner .
Later , it decided to take a stake in the company .
It was the first time Intel had ever invested in an Asian Internet company .
Inforian , or pAsia as it is now known , has grown from four employees to a staff of several hundred , and has become a multinational with offices in the United States and on the mainland , as well as in Taiwan .
The Internet lifestyle
" At pAsia we emphasize that the Internet is a kind of technological art that allows people to improve their lifestyle , " Hsueh says .
" This is a work of art that requires creativity to be whole .
The Internet is part software , part media , part databank , and part communications device .
It 's the best possible space for making the most out of creativity .
" On the front door to the company 's office on Hsinyi Road , Leonardo DaVinci , Albert Einstein and the pAsia logo grace each other with their respective presences .
Hsueh notes that those two historical figures ' hard work and creativity changed the way people live .
This is also the spirit that pAsia wishes to project .
As far as Hsueh is concerned , the Internet is both a tool and a communications platform .
Internet companies , she believes , should reflect that .
As one such company , pAsia must be flexible , efficient and practice what it preaches .
The intranet at pAsia , for instance , provides chatrooms , vacation request forms , work guidelines , business travel forms , and even a bulletin board for selling workers ' second - hand stuff .
The offices have neon decorations on the walls and a hallway that is no less stylish than a haute couture catwalk .
The whole office is infused with a modern and technological sensibility .
Of course , success is never guaranteed .
American Tech stocks took a tumble in April of this year , and people began to talk about an Internet bubble .
Meanwhile , pAsia has had trouble obtaining new financing and has seen rapid turnover in its executive ranks , while rumors have circulated about its IPO application being rejected .
Nevertheless , Hsueh holds that pAsia has a clear niche and is very adaptable , so that it will be relatively unaffected by the economic downturn .
When you see Heidi Hsueh 's fresh young face and her no - nonsense approach to doing business , you quickly understand how members of the young generation are realizing their revolutionary ideas about lifestyle and career through the Internet .
Last - Minute Legislative Binge Opens New Era for Defense , Finance , and Human
-LRB- Jackie Chen / tr. by Phil Newell -RRB-
Rights
The second session of the Fourth Leg - islative Yuan ended on January 15th .
After government and opposition legislators burned the midnight oil for a whole week , 113 bills were passed .
Quantitatively , this was the most bills passed in a single session since 1948 .
But from the qualitative standpoint , there are many problems .
In addition , the session saw a public scandal in which legislators have been suspected of using back - door channels to get state - run financial institutions to invest in private venture capital companies .
Also , with the presidential elections fast approaching , many laws appeared intended to benefit a certain candidate .
Controversial legislation included :
1 .
Regulations governing the distribution of expense account money to local elected representatives and village and neighborhood chiefs : These regulations greatly increase payments made to local executive and assembly officials .
With the passage of this law , the budget for these expenses should be forced up from the current NT$ 4.4 billion to more than NT$ 7 billion .
Besides being seen as a blatant handout to influence the presidential election , and a contradiction of government promises to eliminate the positions of these local officials -LRB- who are big players in political patronage networks -RRB- , the law also brought criticism from Taipei and Kaohsiung city councillors , whose salaries are cut by the bill .
However , Minister of the Interior Huang Chu - wen insists that city councillors were amply consulted during the drafting process .
2 .
The law to encourage private - sector participation in public infrastructure projects : This law stipulates that the private sector may undertake BOT projects -LRB- build , operate , and transfer to the government -RRB- for major public infrastructure , including development of new towns , major industrial enterprises , and high - tech facilities .
Besides offering tax incentives , the new law will assist private investors to get beyond the limits of current law and invest in new land .
Indeed , it will even enable private investors to undertake compulsory land purchasing using government authority .
Also , companies involved in major transportation infrastructure will be allowed to issue new stock or corporate debt to raise funds .
This law should have a positive effect for current BOT projects which are facing obstacles , including the high - speed railway and the proposed rapid transit line to CKS International Airport .
There will now be a legal basis for the high - speed railway to raise more capital .
Also , now that the regulations for establishing new towns have been revised , the proposed plan to build a mass transit line to the airport by the Chang Yi financial group can become reality .
However , some scholars have criticized this law for being poorly formulated and open to abuse .
Yang Chung - hsin , a researcher in the Institute of Economics at the Academia Sinica , says that to give financial groups and business operators the same powers as the government to requisition land can only be done if equal attention is given to fairness and efficiency ; otherwise , the interests of landowners will clash , and there will be endless disputes .
3 .
Regulations on a national financial stabilization fund : This law will empower the government to intervene to protect the stock market .
In the event of " threats to national stability " - such as major internal or external events , rapid movements of international capital - the government will be able to draw on an NT$ 500 billion fund .
This law has been criticized by academics as a serious distortion of the market mechanism , as putting the policy makers into the position of being market players , and as inevitably creating opportunities for insider trading and the manipulation of the market to the benefit of a privileged few .
But President Lee Teng - hui and members of the Cabinet have argued that Taiwan 's stock market is too vulnerable to cross-strait developments , and this law will enable the government to stabilize the market - and thus domestic morale - in the event of crises like the 1996 PRC missile tests .
4 .
The National Defense Law and the organic law of the Ministry of Defense : The NDL will unify the administrative channel -LRB- previously handled by the Ministry of Defense -RRB- and the war - fighting chain of command -LRB- previously under the virtually autonomous general staff -RRB- .
Now the general staff will be clearly placed under the minister of defense , who will be a civilian .
These changes mark a new era in ROC military modernization .
The " organic law " will , among other changes , cause individual services to lose their respective intelligence agencies , which will be unified under the general staff .
The political warfare system -LRB- an autonomous system of political commissar - type officers , created in early Republican times , to ensure the loyalty of the military to the nationalist revolution 's leaders -RRB- will be reorganized and its functions will undergo a qualitative change .
Though it remains to be seen if the political warfare system will retain its own officer corps and academy separate from the regular armed forces , Minister of Defense Tang Fei says that the ultimate goal is to unify all the officer corps .
5 .
The coastal defense law and the organic law of the Coast Guard Command : This will establish the Coast Guard as a ministerial level body , responsible for coastal defense and for combating smuggling and illegal immigration .
Some say that this does not conform to the ideal of streamlining the government , and also say that it is very unusual to bring a front - line law enforcement agency into the cabinet .
Also , the idea that the 22,000 - man Coast Guard will be represented in the cabinet , while the 70,000 - plus - man police force remains sub-ministerial , rankles among some police officers .
However , the Executive Yuan argues that Taiwan 's coastal policing work also touches on national defense and sovereignty questions -LRB- with regard to the Tiaoyutai or Spratly Islands , for example -RRB- .
A single unified body with sufficient rank is necessary to integrate these functions with coastal and shoreline law enforcement and fishing harbor inspections .
6 .
Regulations governing reconstruction in the wake of the September 21 earthquake : This law will govern reconstruction after the expiration of the original emergency decree .
It calls on the Executive Yuan to create a community reconstruction fund for damaged areas .
Urban renewal laws have been relaxed to offer incentives for people to rebuild .
The legislation also arranges for children under 18 orphaned by the quake to receive a government - subsidized trust fund to pay for their living expenses and education .

Constitutional Revision Paves Way for Phasing Out National Assembly
-LRB- Chang Ching - ju / tr. by David J.
Toman -RRB-
On April 24 the National Assembly finalized the chief task of the sixth round of constitutional revisions during Lee Teng - hui 's presidency : its own demobilization .
While this development will allay popular fears of an everlasting National Assembly , how to formulate comprehensive measures to fill in the constitutional and functional void of the moribund body becomes the next vital task .
On March 24 , just days after the ROC presidential election , the Council of Grand Justices made a constitutional interpretation of last year 's National Assembly term extension , declaring the move null and void .
This stirred the ire of National Assembly members , who struck back during the ensuing constitutional revision session , claiming that " lifelong privileges for grand justices violate the constitution . "
The reaction by a minority of NA delegates to the grand justices ' constitutional interpretation once again triggered displeasure in society at the body 's refusal to admit its fallibility .
Activists in groups such as the Taipei Society and the Association of Taiwanese University Professors organized a street demonstration to call for the dissolution of the National Assembly .
A further consequence of the grand justices ' ruling was that an election would have to be held to produce a new National Assembly membership before the conclusion of the current term .
While this development had would - be candidates in all parties scrambling to launch election campaigns , by late March the post-presidential-election situation , combined with pressure from public opinion , pushed the KMT to work with the DPP on means to phase out the National Assembly , despite the KMT 's previous opposition to the body 's complete dissolution in the name of preserving the constitutional structure .
For a time , the question of whether to hold elections for the National Assembly , as well as the DPP and KMT 's shared policy for phasing out the body , were viewed as motivated by fear of the growth of the People First Party -LRB- PFP -RRB- .
Thus the hubbub continued over the fate of the National Assembly for a fortnight , until finally the newly formed PFP caucus in the assembly agreed to its gradual downsizing .
This paved the way for the commencement on April 8 of the sixth round of constitutional revisions in recent years , in which such issues as reducing the total number of NA delegates and freezing their powers and duties - amounting to their " self - abolition " - became the center of discussion .
The various parties leveraged their carrots and sticks against their delegates , threatening expulsion for not supporting the neutralization of the National Assembly at the same time as they tried to appease their delegates .
Finally , on April 24 these maneuvers helped bring about the passage of several constitutional revisions , including deactivation of the National Assembly , favorable provisions for residents of Taiwan 's offshore islands -LRB- Kinmen , Matsu , and Penghu -RRB- and military personnel , and revocation of lifelong special privileges for grand justices .
In line with these revisions , the voting public will no longer directly elect NA delegates .
Rather , the National Assembly will become a " task - based body " generated according to proportional political party representation in the legislature , maintaining the rights to ratification of constitutional revisions proposed by the Legislative Yuan , impeachment of the president and vice president , and resolutions on modifications to national territory .
With these changes , legislators will exercise approval over personnel appointments to the Judicial , Examination and Control yuans .
To be fair , the National Assembly does have its unique set of duties and powers under the existing structure , thus few people are ready to call for its complete abolition .
This is especially notable given the ambiguity of Taiwan 's constitutional structure , seeing as it is not a presidential system , a cabinet system , or a two - headed system in the true sense .
Many scholars caution that eliminating the National Assembly and handing all its powers to the Legislative Yuan , while the government structure remains ambiguous , is not the best structural framework .
That said , despite landmark changes such as the full election of the national parliament in Taiwan and establishment of the legal groundwork for the direct election of the ROC president , the ROC Constitution has been revamped with alarming frequency over the past few years .
In fact , some have scoffed that the constitution , the basis upon which the nation 's laws are founded , has been tinkered with more often than the civil and criminal codes .
Further , new duties and authorities were given to the National Assembly in order to achieve successive constitutional revisions .
For instance , in exchange for the assembly agreeing to give up its authority to elect the president , the body was given power of approval over personnel appointments to the Judicial Yuan , Examination Yuan , and Control Yuan .
With each revision , the constitution became increasingly jumbled , while NA delegates leveraged their positions to exact " constitutional amendment rent " and fatten themselves up .
Last year 's term extension bill further solidified the public 's image of the National Assembly as no more than a tool of political struggle , and a self - indulgent body at that , generating widespread consensus on the necessity of dissolving it .
While the latest round of constitutional revisions satisfies the general desire across the political spectrum to progressively dismantle the National Assembly , sloppy accompanying provisions and the failure of the various political parties to propose a new blueprint in its place provide cause for new concern over the health of constitutional government in the ROC .
For example , the National Assembly will become a " task - based body " generated according to the proportion of seats held by each political party in the legislature .
National Taiwan University professor Lee Hung - hsi , an expert on constitutional law , points out that less than 10 % of the Taiwanese population takes part in political party activities .
Thus a National Assembly generated proportionally according to party representation represents suppression of the views of the other 90 % of the population , and thus violates the principle of vesting authority over constitutional government in the people .
Following the demobilization of the National Assembly , many functions and powers currently held by the National Assembly will be transferred to the Legislative Yuan .
This in turn raises fears in the academic community that the Legislative Yuan could become an untamable new constitutional monster .
The expanded powers of the Legislative Yuan also include the impeachment and recall of the president and vice president , and the supplementary election of the vice president .
These changes tighten the relationship between the parliament and the president , requiring the president to report to the Legislative Yuan on the state of the nation .
But the president has only the passive authority to dissolve the parliament .
In the face of a parliament with supreme powers , a president whose party claims only a minority in the legislature is powerless even to replace a premier with whom he does not see eye to eye , leaving him devoid of the authorities and responsibilities to correspond with his administrative actions .
A China Times editorial urged that the question of whether the enormous Legislative Yuan might be split into two houses by function be evaluated and worked out as soon as possible .
The legal demobilization of the National Assembly was conducted without a hitch , yet the future of constitutional government looks bleak .
This dire outlook is surely not something Taiwan 's political parties expected when , attempting to align with public opinion , they moved to phase out the National Assembly .
Party Hardy ?
Will the Election Weaken Political Parties ?
-LRB- Eric Lin / photos by Sinorama Office of Photography / tr. by John Murphy -RRB-
In Taiwan 's " quiet revolution " of democratization , the people have participated enthusiastically , but not irrationally .
Now that there are two strong parties , the KMT and DPP , the slogan of " peaceful rotation of political parties in power " has become one of the most widely used appeals for the opposition .
It happens to be the turn of the mil - lennium , and this has inspired many people to think of change .
In the middle of March , Taiwan will select the president who will lead the island into the new century .
But the election , besides affecting the future direction of the country , has another rarely mentioned dimension : Since the three major candidates Lien Chan , Chen Shui - bian , and James Soong are running roughly equal , this suggests that after the election there may be a restructuring of Taiwan 's political party system .
The people of Taiwan are selecting not only their future leaders , but are choosing a new direction for party politics and democratic development .
What is it about the political environment that means that the election for the president of the ROC , which was not conceived as a presidential system , will affect the future development of the country ?
How will party politics change after the election ?
Is there likely to be a constitutional crisis ?
In Taiwan in the year 2000 , there are many challenges :
The pressure is on to achieve industrial upgrading and internationalization .
Also , there needs to be clear progress in the critical area of cross-strait relations .
Although entry into the World Trade Organization will create a new situation in the Taiwan Strait , the two sides remain in an obscure relationship that is neither war nor peace .
Taiwan must come up with a comprehensive policy that considers economic , diplomatic , and military factors .
Internally , there are a number of worrying problems - " black gold politics " -LRB- the confluence of criminal gangs , moneyed interests , and corrupt politicians -RRB- , rising crime , and only erratic environmental consciousness .
It is urgent to achieve consensus on these problems in order to find solutions .
Three - way battle
The desire for change is reflected in the upcoming presidential election .
This is the beginning of the post-strongman era .
John Pomfret , bureau chief of the Washington Post , points out that , after a long era of rule by virtually unchallenged leaders , the electorate is looking for more choice .
The 2000 race , with so many tickets contending , reflects this aspiration .
At the top , this election is a contest among Taiwan 's second - generation political elites .
Underneath , it is a struggle among the various forces that currently exist in Taiwan 's society .
The KMT nominee , Lien Chan , is seen as Lee Teng - hui 's annointed successor .
He represents the continuation of Kuomintang tradition .
Chen Shui - bian , the nominee of the Democratic Progressive Party , is the greatest hope for the opposition party as it seeks the first - ever transfer of power in Taiwan .
Independent candidate James Soong , meanwhile , represents forces which have split away from the Kuomintang .
He is seen as leading a second wave of " anti-Lee Teng - hui " sentiment , similar to that which led to the creation of the New Party several years ago .
Soong 's candidacy has opened up new fault lines in Taiwan 's party politics , and has attracted the support of many NP legislators and other non-KMT and non-DPP forces .
The New Party itself , which is on the edge of collapse , has nominated the renowned author Li Ao as its candidate , though Li is not a party member .
In addition to these four , former DPP chairman Hsu Hsin - liang , having failed to win the nomination of his party , withdrew from the DPP and is running as an independent .
Since the campaign began in earnest , Lien , Chen , and Soong have been getting roughly similar numbers in public opinion polls , with about a quarter of the electorate undecided .
With the election so close at hand , and the situation so uncertain , naturally the media and society have been focused on analyzing the election battle itself .
Very few people have transcended this to ask what impact the three - way power struggle will have on the future political situation .
Public opinion trial balloon
The ROC constitution was not originally designed as a presidential system .
The constitution divided power among five branches of government , with the premier as head of the executive branch , and the president separate from , but theoretically not controlling , these five .
In the past , presidents Chiang Kai - shek and Chiang Ching - kuo were the de facto unchallenged rulers of the nation , but that was because of their roles as chairmen of the Kuomintang , which , under the old one - party system , outlawed any opposition .
They were president because they were powerful , not powerful because they were president .
But today times have changed , and so has the constitution .
Most importantly , the constitutional power of the president has been greatly increased .
Lin Wen - cheng , an associate professor in the Graduate Institute of Mainland China Studies at National Sun Yat - sen University , notes that the president had always enjoyed a number of special powers : appointing and dismissing of officials , dissolving of the parliament , issuing of emergency decrees in times of national emergency , and determining national - security - related policies through the National Security Council and the National Security Bureau .
But recent constitutional revisions also give the president the power to appoint the premier without requiring approval from the Legislative Yuan .
This means that the president is now the guiding figure behind all executive branch policy .
Of course President Lee Teng - hui 's exercise of such powers has not proved politically destabilizing because he has been concurrently chairman of the KMT , which enjoys a majority in the Legislative Yuan .
However , if the opposition wins the presidency , it is uncertain whether the president and legislature will be able to work together harmoniously .
If there are conflicts , this could spark a constitutional crisis .
Another development that needs watching is that direct election of the president has weakened political parties .
Alexander Lu , professor of political science at National Taiwan University , states that voters no longer base their choice primarily on political party .
This is what has enabled independent candidate James Soong to remain a powerful force even after leaving the KMT .
Whether he wins or not , his candidacy signals a drastic change in Taiwan 's party politics .
Candidate as hero
Lu continues : " Direct election of the president has ' put the candidate on a pedestal , ' turning the attention of the voters to the individual .
But in fact the most significant thing about this election is not which ' hero ' will lead the country .
Rather , voters should pay even more attention to how each of the candidates could affect future party politics and the direction of constitutional development . "
In fact , Taiwan 's main parties - the KMT and the DPP as the two major parties , with the New Party as a noteworthy but limited third force - all understand the implications of James Soong 's powerful candidacy very clearly .
They know that this election is not only a struggle for political office , but even more is a critical moment that may decide whether their respective parties develop , split up , or disappear .
KMT party chairman Lee Teng - hui has repeatedly called on voters to cherish the system of party politics that has been constructed in the process of democratization ; the KMT wants confirmation that people still see it as a coherent , positive political institution .
The DPP sees this election as its chance to displace the KMT and set a precedent for the peaceful rotation of political parties in power , thereby consolidating its position as the main alternative to the KMT .
James Soong , on the other hand , hoping to take advantage of the desire for change , emphasizes that if he is elected as a non-party candidate he will promote reforms which will alter the roles of the major parties .
The New Party is in the most embarrassing position , since its candidate -LRB- Li Ao -RRB- is not even a party member , and has been unable to keep most of its members from shifting their support to Soong instead ; this election could therefore hasten the collapse of the NP .
Peaceful transfer of power
If Chen Shui - bian is elected , this would be Taiwan 's first case of a peaceful transfer of power from one party to another .
DPP legislator Chang Chun - hung says that the process of democratization in Taiwan during Lee Teng - hui 's administration has been smooth and tranquil , but beneath the surface there lurks a major threat to democracy : the KMT 's " black gold politics . "
Explains Chang : The DPP has never had the chance to be the ruling party , and therefore has never been in a position to fulfill its function of restraining the KMT .
The result of this long - term trend is that the KMT is " overnourished " by feeding on the resources of the state and society while the opposition parties are " undernourished . "
Chang says if there were a transfer of power , the opposition would be able to understand more clearly the actual difficulties of governing and to see more clearly the dark corners that need to be cleaned out .
Meanwhile , the ruling party , with its rich experience in governing , would be very qualified to play the role of overseeing the DPP , and a defeat for the KMT could also promote its internal reassessment and reform .
Were Chen Shui - bian to win , though the DPP would take control of the executive branch , Taiwan 's current two - major - plus - one - minor party structure would probably not change very much .
Chen Wen - cheng says that a Chen victory would have its greatest impact on the New Party - and that the effect would be positive .
After an impressive start , the NP has faded steadily over the past few elections , and suffered an especially sharp blow in the election for mayor of Taipei two years ago .
NP votes drifted to Ma Ying - jeou , a member of the KMT -LRB- albeit not one of Lee Teng - hui 's personal favorites -RRB- .
The NP candidate received only an anemic percentage of the ballots , bringing the party to the edge of collapse .
But if Chen Shui - bian becomes president , because the DPP is seen as the party of Taiwan independence - the direct antithesis of the New Party - this could inspire NP members to pull together , and at the same time give the party the status and ability to absorb the forces that are backing James Soong .
This would contribute to the building of a true three - party system .
An opposition - controlled legislature
If Chen Shui - bian is elected , his biggest challenge will come from the Legislative Yuan , and the first problem will be naming a premier .
Although the constitution stipulates that the president does not need the approval of the Legislative Yuan to name a premier , given the fact that the KMT has a majority there , Chen faces the problem of finding a premier who will be able to work with KMT legislators .
The Chen camp is well aware of this problem .
Therefore they have let it be known that Chen would like to ask Lee Yuan - tse , the universally respected Nobel Prize winner who is currently president of the Academia Sinica , to be his premier .
Chen , who knows that within the DPP there is little high - level governing experience , has repeatedly raised the idea of a " coalition government . "
However , it should be noted , there are after all great ideological differences between the DPP and the other parties .
KMT legislator Li Hsien - jen points out that the DPP retains advocacy of Taiwan independence in its party platform , and DPP vice-presidential candidate Annette Lu is well known for her support of Taiwan independence .
It is therefore hard to guarantee that the executive branch will not come into conflict with the legislature .
In such a conflict , the premier would be caught in the crossfire .
The legislature could pass a vote of no confidence and completely boycott the premier , or the premier could dissolve the parliament and appeal to a public referendum .
Either case would spark a constitutional crisis .
Alexander Lu agrees that a Chen victory could lead to inter-branch conflict .
But he does not see Taiwan independence as the main flashpoint .
The critical issues will instead be those related to " black gold politics , " such as stock trading taxes , which directly affect the interests of certain legislators .
Lu explains : " Currently the Legislative Yuan is filled with representatives of capital .
When it comes to laws that directly affect their personal privileges and interests , even the KMT is powerless to control them .
Chen Shui - bian has repeatedly emphasized that he intends to wipe out black gold politics and will never compromise .
Inevitably , then , there will be a clash with these legislators . "
Lien Chan 's burden
If Lien Chan is elected , the party - politics issues most deserving of attention will be whether this hastens the demise of the New Party and whether the KMT party organization and the government can move together in step .
Lien is seen as Lee Teng - hui 's designated successor .
But , given the term system for the chairmanship of the KMT , after the election there will be a period of time in which Lee remains party chairman , while Lien is president .
In the past , state policy has always been decided by the party chairman .
Observers are very curious about whether the KMT has in fact changed , or whether we will see a repeat of what happened back in the late 1970s :
At that time Yen Chia - kan was president , but national policy was in fact determined by Chiang Ching - kuo , whose authority derived from his post as party chairman and who took the position of premier from which to oversee day - to - day policy - making .
As Li Hsien - jen analyzes the situation , if Lien Chan is elected , there will indeed be a transition period in his relations with Lee Teng - hui .
But this is not necessarily a bad thing for the KMT .
Consider , says Li , the fact that James Soong 's candidacy has raised the specter of a party split .
A victory for Lien , with Lee continuing as party chairman , would be helpful to the KMT in resolving internal party disputes , and in consolidating Lien 's party and government position .
He says that it is unlikely that the Yen - Chiang situation would be repeated , since Lee Teng - hui will certainly not have an office like premier which would involve him in day - to - day policy - making .
What would a Lien victory mean for the New Party ?
Remember that the NP was organized primarily out of opposition to Lee Teng - hui .
If Lien Chan can escape from Lee 's shadow , the New Party would lose its original purpose , and members could possibly return to the KMT , restoring the two - party system that reigned before the NP was formed .
Another significant possibility is that New Party members , who tend to support James Soong , could organize a brand - new political party with remnant Soong backers after the election .
Shao Tsung - hai , a professor at National Chengchih University and a campaign staffer for James Soong , states : Soong has reiterated that he personally has no intention of organizing a new political party after the election .
But the political forces that support him will necessarily have to organize themselves in some fashion .
Moreover , after Lee Teng - hui leaves the scene , and the NP no longer has that fixation , the possibility of establishing a new party with Soong 's other supporters -LRB- who by no means necessarily dislike Lee -RRB- increases .
If this happens , the New Party will no longer be in decline as it is now , but will re-emerge as a force to be reckoned with , and Taiwan will be looking at a true three - party system .
If Lien Chan is elected , the KMT will continue to hold both executive power and a legislative majority , and the premier will serve simply as the chief of staff to the president .
However , based on current public opinion polls , it appears that whoever wins , Lien included , will be only a " plurality president , " without a strong mandate to rule .
To a certain degree , then , he will have to accommodate other political forces .
Chang Chun - hung , who knows the legislative environment very well , explains : " Even now in order to pass important legislation there must be compromise and negotiations .
It will be virtually impossible for the KMT to railroad through legislation under the leadership of a president who does n't enjoy majority public support . "
The need for compromise could be further increased by the proposed law currently under discussion to put all party assets in blind trust .
This would , at least on paper , reduce the financial leverage the KMT would have over its legislators , and KMT representatives could become even more difficult for the party to control .
Lien Chan may face the problem of being unable to enforce the decisions of the party center .
If Soong wins . . . .
Many supporters of James Soong are people dissatisfied with the current state of the main parties .
It is generally believed that if Soong wins the election , this could spark a dramatic reorganization of party politics .
The main blow could fall on the New Party , which could find itself made irrelevant , with the KMT also strongly affected .
If Soong wins , it is considered virtually inevitable that his supporters will organize some sort of political organization .
Shao Tsung - hai says frankly that , even if Soong himself does not lead the way , his supporters - faced with the reality of party politics in Taiwan - would have to organize in order to coordinate their operations .
At the same time , according to public opinion surveys , an extremely high percentage of NP members support Soong .
If Soong wins , it would be logical for these people to leave the NP and join forces with other Soong backers , thereby gutting the New Party .
NP secretary - general Lee Ben - nan states : " As early as last year , the leadership realized that our party could potentially disappear " if Soong wins .
But Soong is the closest of the three main candidates to the NP ideals , thus putting the NP in a dilemma .
The party nominated Li Ao to maintain the party profile , and the NP leadership still calls on party members to support Li , but also says it will understand if its members vote for another candidate .
If Soong wins , the KMT could also be thrown into crisis .
In this election , several leading KMT figures have publicly come out in favor of James Soong , and have been expelled from the KMT as a result .
Though these could be explained away as individuals who were not able to satisfy their personal ambitions inside the party , there are also many still in the KMT who secretly are pro-Soong .
If elected , Soong will have a wealth of government resources with which to attract even more people to openly support him , and this could be the straw that breaks the KMT 's back .
Based on this logic , Lin Wen - cheng says that an era of three - party politics is on the way .
Though it is impossible to say whether such a situation would be stable , for those who are dissatisfied with the current choices and who want a reshuffling of party politics in Taiwan , this is the opportunity to create a fresh climate .
Chang Chun - hung suggests that , in addition to uncertainty in party politics , a Soong victory could also bring instability to Taiwan 's constitutional system .
Except for some of his followers who were with him in the provincial government , Soong 's camp lacks any experience in inter-group political bargaining .
With Soong as president , political elites in Taiwan would be , as Alexander Lu describes it , like a basketball team whose players have never played together before .
Soong 's camp will first have to integrate their own internal views , and then , to win confidence and trust from the Legislative Yuan , work with both the KMT and the DPP .
Such a situation is unlikely to result in much policy innovation , and in fact even the initial step of selecting a premier could prove extremely difficult .
Although the KMT , DPP , and NP all have legislators who might join the Soong camp if Soong wins , Soong 's team will still need support from the KMT and/or the DPP , support they can only get through negotiation .
Past experience has shown that the KMT and DPP can work together to boycott Executive Yuan proposals ; if they do this to a Soong - led executive branch , this could lead to a crisis ending in either a vote of no confidence or dissolution of the parliament .
The possibility of a constitutional crisis looks much greater under Soong than under Chen Shui - bian or Lien Chan .
The " he 's one of us " effect
Few voters can see the significance of this election for party politics .
In this atmosphere of choosing among " individual heroes " rather than parties , voters are more concerned about the candidates ' characters and deportment than they are about their policy views or party backgrounds .
That is why Soong , who early on was significantly ahead of his rivals in public opinion polls , saw a dramatic drop in support after the Chung Hsing Bills scandal broke .
Meanwhile , newspapers and TV are filled with negative advertising in which candidates sling mud at one another .
These ads are giving voters the impression that the nation 's future leaders are all " bad apples . "
This not only marks the deterioration of electoral culture , but is a serious blow to morale in the nation and society .
The effects may prove to be far - reaching .
Chang Chun - hung adds that negative election tactics , which after all may be seen in any democratic country , are not - bad as they are - the biggest threat .
He says Taiwan voters should most be on the lookout for the " one of us " effect .
Mobilization of votes based on ethnicity or provincial origin is the cheapest route to victory .
This has long been a tactic used in Taiwan elections .
As a result , Taiwan 's ethnic groups are pitted against one another politically .
Lin Wen - cheng states that in terms of daily life , differences between Taiwan 's ethnic groups have largely disappeared .
But , because ethnic cleavages are constantly being exploited in elections , inter-group political conflict remains serious .
Lin contends : " It is inevitable that minority groups in any society feel insecure about their status .
In the last election for the mayor of Taipei , it was obvious that virtually all mainlanders voted for Ma Ying - jeou .
Because the majority Taiwanese do not feel threatened , they were less likely to vote based on provincial origin , giving Ma enough cross-over votes to beat out Chen Shui - bian .
In this upcoming election , James Soong [ who is a mainlander ] is also getting a lot of support from Hakka people , who sympathize with his outsider status and remember his support for Hakka identity . "
Unfortunately , however " natural " it is that minority groups feel insecure , exploitation of these cleavages for electoral gain can only have a negative long - term impact on society as a whole .
In the 2000 election , Taiwan will not only be choosing a new leader .
It will also be choosing a new direction for party politics , and will help decide future relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and between ethnic groups in Taiwan .
How can people make a wise choice among the many value systems on offer ?
How can they monitor their new leader to ensure that Taiwan has a peaceful future free of the influence of " black gold politics " ?
These are not only questions for this election , but eternal challenges for the whole people in any democratic society .
Bands Make Their Mark
-LRB- Eric Lin / tr. by David Mayer -RRB-
The band tradition in Taiwan dates back to the time when the US military forces had bases on the island .
It was de rigueur to have a live band at all the bars frequented by American soldiers .
Veteran radio program host Tao Hsiao - ching recalls that when she wanted to organize a concert in the 1960s , there were already a lot of bands to choose from .
Apart from bands that worked the bars , there were others that went into the pop music scene .
One example was " The Five Flower Petals , " a five - girl band .
Lead singer Tsai Mi - mi had a very sweet voice -LRB- " Mama ! Mama ! Give me a guitar . . . . " -RRB- , and she was nice looking too .
But the Flower Petals were n't so much a band as a collection of teen idols .
A number of bands appeared in the 1960s that sang mostly Western songs .
Their lead singers sometimes got noticed by music companies and became famous singers .
The most famous ones were Huang Ying - ying , Julie Su , Kao Ling - feng , and Billy .
Campus bands across the island began writing their own music and lyrics in the 1970s .
Notable examples include The Travelers and Wood Guitar .
These bands , and the folk music they sang , reigned supreme on into the 1980s until the sudden rise of a number of extremely popular rock bands .
Some of the more notable 1980s rock bands were The Chiu Chiu 's , The Red Ants , and several bands featuring Hsueh Yueh .
Looking back on the origins of band music , Tao Hsiao - ching attributes its popularity to the albums of Lo Ta - yu and the fact that many proprietors of pubs and other establishments that hire live music started putting emphasis on " the band sound . "
The social commentary in the lyrics of these songs also elicited a strong response .
According to Wang Tsu - shou , a senior reporter at Minsheng Daily , " Youth bands were so popular , we thought for a while that we had entered into a sort of ' Age of the Band , ' but it turned out to be short - lived . "
The high tide of band music spurred the formation of many student bands , and KHS Musical Company used to organize an annual campus rock band competition where many singers and bands got their first big break , including Chang Yu - sheng , Tai Cheng - hsiao , and The Orient Express .
The latter , which was composed entirely of good - looking guys , was the only group that released an album together after going professional , however , while Chang and Tai opted to strike out on their own as solo artists .
As Tao Hsiao - ching explains , band music only appealed to a limited market , and it was very expensive to keep a band operating .
For these reasons , music companies preferred to sign up only the lead singers .
This remained the prevailing pattern in the industry from Kao Ling - feng 's time through the appearance of Chang Yu - sheng .
Then China , Harlem Yu & Ding Jian Pai Dang , Baboo , and Wu Bai and his band all released albums in 1992 .
The music world was electrified , and people began talking once again about the arrival of " the Age of the Band , " but the market for this music was still weak .
The only one of these albums that became a big hit was Harlem Yu & Ding Jian Pai Dang , and this album 's strong sales were due in large part to the fame of the singer , Harlem Yu .
Wu Bai , in the meantime , held fast to his rock style and struggled into the mid-90s .
Then , playing to small pub audiences , he finally hooked up with a band called China Blue and rocketed to immense popularity as locally rooted Taiwanese culture began to take on a certain cachet .
The success of Wu Bai & China Blue has rested primarily , however , on Wu 's reputation as a singer and songwriter , while the band has played more of a supporting role .
Amidst this rebirth of youth bands in the 1990s , there has been a very interesting undercurrent .
Groupie , LTK Commune , and a raft of other underground bands have quietly been carving out a niche for themselves in the pub scene .
Both mainstream and non-mainstream music companies -LRB- such as Friendly Dog and Crystal Records , respectively -RRB- have begun to release their albums , thus giving a small number of enthusiasts ample opportunity to keep up to date with the unde
Pinglin ,
Tea Capital of Taipei County

Take a pinch of Pouchong tea leaves , place them in a cup of boiling - hot water , and before the second hand on the clock has completed a revolution , you 'll be assailed by the delicate fragrance of the freshly made golden green brew .
It 's the same sweet fragrance that fills the air everywhere you go when you 're in Pinglin .
Pinglin Township is situated in rural southern Taipei County .
Being relatively remote , the area was not developed until the late 18th century .
Pinglin is a pocket of level ground set in mountain forests , whence its name , which means " forest on level ground . "
Arriving there , you 're greeted by mountainsides of emerald green surrounding the town of Pinglin , and winding through it the Peishih River , its crystal waters so clear that you can see right to the bottom .
The population is steady at about 6,000 - 7,000 .
It seems just the way it was 20 - odd years ago , and gives the impression that in another 20 years time , it will still retain this way of life without the constant hankering for more .
What is it about Pinglin , nestled on the outskirts of Taipei , that makes it able to maintain an idyllic life free from the lure of material gain ?
Roll out the red tape
In 1979 , the Urban Development Law placed the Pinglin area under controls pertaining to Taipei 's water catchment areas , and since then it has been extremely difficult to cultivate Pinglin 's agricultural land .
Nor can more buildings be put up to cater to any increase in the population .
All that can be done are just very minimal repairs and renovations to the already existing housing stock , and this has caused a sharp decline in the value of land there .
Under the myriad regulations , Pinglin 's population has plummeted .
Although many want to return , they often shy away because of the difficulties life in Pinglin would entail .
Chen Hsin - ping is a man in his early twenties who works at the Ping Lin Tea Museum .
Drinking some wine , he says , " Here in Pinglin we do n't have a single entertainment venue .
Really , not one .
And all the regulations drive us crazy .
If you want to build a house or do some extension , there 'll be some person coming to investigate , and it 's always the same , you ca n't do this , and you ca n't do that . "
The many restrictions safeguard Pinglin 's beautiful natural setting , but they exact a heavy toll from the local people .
Luckily , Pinglin produces fine tea to follow the alcohol in which they drown their cares .
A refined air
Pinglin is an ideal location for tea cultivation , and many there had been doing it since way back , but after Pinglin started winning first prizes in the provincial government 's tea competitions , the government began to pay serious attention to Pinglin tea .
Moreover , seeing the profitability of tea , almost all the local farmers began specializing in tea .
The freshly picked tips of Oolong tea , with their green buds and twin leaves , become a bright and luminous gold when steeped in hot water .
Whether sold domestically or exported , Pinglin 's Pouchong tea enjoys a wide market and good distribution channels .
Both superior and inferior grades of tea bring a good return , and so for 90 % of the people of Pinglin , life revolves around tea .
When the spring and autumn tea harvests are on , the people in every household can barely snatch four hours sleep a night , because the whole sequence from picking the tea leaves and processing them into their final form , requires more than ten uninterrupted hours , at the least .
The fragrance of tea accompanies them to bed each night , and awaits them in the morning .
The days go on in this fashion for a month or two .
Huang Kuei - ying lives in rural Pinglin .
As a young girl she helped with the tea work , and later her husband also cultivated tea .
Remembering the grueling heat of summer , she sighs , " Women in Pinglin have a really hard life .
They get barely a few hours sleep a night in tea - picking season , and they still have to look after their family and the housework . "
Her neighbour , Lin , laughs in agreement , " Tea processing , it just kills you ! "
The Hsin Ping Tea Emporium has won numerous awards in tea competitions .
The proprietor , Mr. Chen , has been associated with tea since he was very young : " I never got very far in school , so the best thing is to keep on growing tea . "
When we turned to the secret of how to process good tea , Mr. Chen was spare with words .
" You need focus , and experience . "
Indeed , to pick tea you have to take into account the weather and then , after selecting just the right time to pick , you carry out a series of fermentation steps that vary depending on just what the leaves are like that day .
How long should the leaves ferment outdoors ?
How long indoors ?
These questions are decided by the grower , using everything at his disposal - eyes , nose , heart , mind , mouth , and hands , all working in harmony .
A tiny bit more , a second less - it 's a discipline and an art .
Following fermentation , step by step , the tips are withered and crumbled , any lumps are broken up , then the tips are fired .
Each of these steps affects the quality of the finished product .
The timing must be accurately calculated , the temperature must be precise .
Unfortunately , there are no standards to follow .
Absolutely everything relies on each grower 's store of personal experience .
Tough times ahead for tea growers ?
The annual tea competition in Pinglin is a chance for tea growers to talk shop .
They examine and appraise the teas , note the aroma and the color of the steeped tea , and assess the good and bad points of every family 's tea .
Different grades will bring different prices on the market .
Award - winning teas often sell out .
For better or worse , the tea growers ' reputations are made on such occasions .
According to Mr. Chen , the growers compare themselves with each other , discussing their processing methods .
When someone does n't do as well as they had hoped in a tea competition , they try to figure out why their tea did n't match up with that of other growers .
" You need to constantly reflect , review and discuss your processing .
That 's the only way to improve the quality . "
These days , about 80 % of the people in Pinglin still depend on tea for their livelihood .
With the economy slowing down , however , tea is not as easy to sell as it used to be .
In the past there used to be a vigorous export market , but the countries of Southeast Asia have cut into the market .
Pinglin has always specialized in quality teas rather than cater to the mass - production foreign tea markets , but if even domestic sales are having difficulties , what can the growers do to ensure their livelihoods ?
Huang Kuei - ying also comments that tea is n't as easy to sell as it once was .
Growers are sometimes exploited by middlemen , and the tea grown with their sweat and blood ends up being sold for a very low price .
" It 's terrible !
Many growers just ca n't find words for what 's happening , especially with what 's going to happen later , joining that whatever - it - is trade organization .
That could really be a disaster ! "
Huang 's concerns may well be shared by many others .
Nevertheless , Mr. Chen has deep confidence , " As long as our tea is good , we need n't fear that no - one will buy it ! "
The township chief , Liang Chin - sheng , does n't hide his pride in and his concerns about Pinglin 's tea industry .
Says Liang , " Here in Pinglin we worship tea as a god .
We look after it like a sweetheart . "
As well as encouraging the local people to constantly enhance their tea growing and processing skills , he devotes even more energy to managing the " tea culture " to which tea has given rise , including by - products such as tea pastries and similar light refreshments .
But far more important , is to draw deeply on Pinglin 's unique and refined qualities as a tea district and imbue the hearts and minds of local inhabitants and visitors alike with a deep appreciation of tea culture .
With this in mind they are training local people to do voluntary cultural work , organizing activities associated with tea , producing and conserving local gazetteers and histories , all richly steeped in the style and romance of tea .
Speaking of the assaults they face with the opening of the market , the township chief knits his brows tightly ,
" I hope the government can do something substantial to promote Taiwanese tea and draw up regulations for proper channels for marketing tea .
Let everyone see how good it is to drink tea , and experience for themselves tea 's benefits .
This is the only way that tea will have a market ; and then the younger generation will be willing to take over from us . "
Hoping for fewer regulations
In early times Pinglin was a key waystation on the Old Tan Lan Trail leading from Taipei to Ilan .
These days the old road has been replaced by the Taipei - Ilan Highway .
The current road brings a lot of visitors to Pinglin and has made transport of the tea produce much easier .
It was originally thought that the Taipei - Ilan Expressway , due for completion in 2003 , would also bring Pinglin new benefits , but the government is now planning to restrict the interchange to only large vehicles and locals from Pinglin .
This is in order to protect the water catchment area .
The township chief throws up his hands and comments with exasperation that in everything the government has done it has treated the local people officiously and shown no confidence in them .
In his view , the government should think of some way whereby both Pinglin and the water resource protection zone can coexist and prosper .
If they 're afraid that the new expressway will bring hordes of people and pollute the water resources , then what they should do , within reasonable bounds , is allow the people here to build public facilities for visitors which will help minimise their impact on the local ecology , for example public toilets and comprehensive rubbish disposal .
This would give people from outside the area more opportunity to appreciate Pinglin 's idyllic natural setting .
The local people have formed a fish conservation team and as a result the Peishih River is now protected .
Many prized species of Taiwanese fish are being propagated .
In the pristine forests are ancient pine forests with species unique to Taiwan , and the deep blue skies attract waves of students to Pinglin to camp out and observe the stars .
The calloused hands of the tea growers are steeped with the vitality of tea .
Last year Pinglin 's Pouchong tea earned the " Presidential Seal . "
The tea growers straighten their backs , throwing themselves into the tea processing , and wait for their sons and grandsons to come home and enjoy a cup of fine tea with them .
So , next time you go to Pinglin , please do n't just treat it as a quick pitstop .
Sit down for a pot of some of the best tea in all of Taiwan .

Rising Tide
-LRB- Chuang Chih / tr. by Robert Taylor -RRB-
Taiwan is currently being gripped by a wave of nostalgia .
If the film In the Mood for Love , starring Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung , shows the face of Hong Kong in the 1960s , what Ko Ching - hua 's book Rising Tide reveals is a story of old Taipei , and the author 's little - known tragic and difficult childhood .
For old Taipei folk in their 50s and 60s , perhaps Ko Ching - hua 's Rising Tide can help them rediscover the feel of that age which was theirs .
And for younger readers , reading the book can be a journey into the past .
Incredible !
This elegant gent before me , dressed in a silk shirt and a dark brown woolen suit with a light , fine check pattern , savoring his coffee and chatting about French films , this classical music lover with a penchant for refined European life , looks utterly the product of a comfortable , happy upbringing .
Who would have thought that a stream of bitterly painful childhood memories would flood through his book - memories that came as a complete surprise even to friends who know him well .
Author Wang Ting - chun writes in his review " The Tide Comes in for Ko Ching - hua " : " I have known Ko for many years , but I was quite unaware of the difficulties of his youth .
Looking back at his easygoing , elegant style , there was nothing about him to suggest he had ever endured hardship . "
Essayist Pan Jen - mu , however , has a much more emotional response :
" Reading Rising Tide reduced me to tears !
For he has expressed all the distress and privations of our youth . "
The images revealed in Rising Tide are many - faceted .
There are the joys and sorrows of the author 's childhood and teenage years ; there are the twists and turns of his love , marriage and his first excursions into the literary world ; there is the nostalgia of an old Taipei resident for Taipei 's past ; and there is also the beautiful story of a literary gardener tilling the soil of his dreams .
Ko Ching - hua -LRB- whose close friends call him " Old K " -RRB- can be called the doyen of Taiwan 's literary world .
His ancestral home was in Yongjia , Zhejiang Province .
Born in Shanghai in 1937 , at the age of seven he was taken by his parents to Kunshan in Jiangsu Province , to be looked after by a family named Gu .
They were rice farmers , and young Ko had to work in the fields , planting rice seedlings and so on .
When he was ten , his father brought him to Taiwan , via Shanghai .
After they disembarked at Keelung , Ko Ching - hua wept all the way as they walked from the pier , past Jen - ai Road and to their home in Ningpo West Street .
It was only when he heard the sound of Peking opera singing coming out of a square wooden box that he stopped crying and asked in bewilderment , " Is there someone in the box ? "
This moment of childish wonder raised the curtain on the drama of his life in Taiwan .
The poor fear moving house
However , he never imagined that the role he was called upon to play would be so lonely and dismal .
Recalling this time so many years later , he still feels pangs of nostalgia for his parents , despite their ill - treatment of him .
His mother and father did not get on well together , and after constant arguments they finally divorced .
Destitute , the family split up and went their separate ways .
Ko Ching - hua 's father Ko Hao was a graduate of the foreign languages department at Hangzhou 's Zhijiang University , and taught English at Taipei First Girls ' High School .
But in Ko Ching - hua 's eyes , he was nothing but a spineless , gullible fool .
It was this spineless father who caused Ko 's childhood to be spent in constant house moving .
In his book , Ko describes his feelings during that time thus : " The poor fear hunger , and also moving house . "
Their series of temporary homes even included an air raid shelter which kept out neither the wind nor the rain , and was not fit for human habitation .
Apart from the problem of accommodation which blighted Ko Ching - hua 's childhood , as a teenager he had to do jobs like selling newspapers and delivering coal briquettes to earn his school fees , so he could finish his schooling .
Ko sums up the poverty which so often made him uncertain where his next meal was coming from , with the simple words : " Hunger is a beast with a painful bite . "
But what anguish lies behind those words !
Ko Ching - hua 's status in Taiwan 's publishing business goes without saying .
In the 25 years since he set up Elite Publishing , which specializes completely in works of literature , he has published many influential books , ranging from Wang Ting - chun 's Open Life and Chi Chun 's Dreaming with a Book for a Pillow to Chang To - wu 's Horses and Foot - Soldiers and Yu Chiu - yu 's A Bitter Cultural Journey .
Ko , who has spent his career publishing other people 's books , had no idea that when he wrote the story of his own childhood it would elicit such a broad response among readers and literature lovers .
He says cheerfully : " I 've made others weep , but I 've made myself laugh . "
Writing the book was a cathartic experience which wiped away the sense of inferiority , the loneliness and the desolation he experienced as a child , so once the book was finished his mood was relaxed and happy .
No wonder Ko says he is now the happiest of men in an unhappy environment .
Walking amid the hubbub of Taipei today , on streets filled with people and traffic , Ko - nan Street , Shanghai Road , the Tri-Service Stadium and the Star Cafe have long since drifted away like the sound of Ko Lan 's mambo song .
Once - familiar scenes are gone with the wind , leaving old Taipei resident Ko Ching - hua somewhat forlorn .
Ko , who likens himself to a peasant in an industrial society , has always insisted on publishing high - quality literature for the common man .
Speaking of the future , he says with a smile that he is planning a long novel .
This is surely something for all of us who love Ko Ching - hua 's writing to look forward to .

Tears that Smile -
Huang Chun - ming 's Letting Them Go
-LRB- Yang Chao / photos by Pu Hua - chih / tr. Scott Williams -RRB-
After more than ten years of silence , a new collection of stories from Huang Chun - ming is a major event , and not just in literary circles .
For readers who have been anticipating a new collection for years , the publication of Letting Them Go is big news .
After such a long " hibernation , " how does this new work compare to Huang 's previous works ?
Sinorama invited the literary critic Yang Chao to provide our readers with the in - depth review which follows .
Huang Chun - ming 's use of fiction to express his concern for the elderly has a long history .
" Cheng - tsai Gets off the Bus , " Huang 's earliest published work , is the tale of an elderly woman taking her grandson to the city to visit her daughter and son - in - law .
Although she is " only 50 , " " her withered face was deeply etched by life and the passage of time . . . giving people the impression that she was in her 60s . "
What really marks her as elderly is not her visage , however , but her inability to carry out a task as simple as catching a bus into the city , and the apprehensive feelings she harbors towards the " cold , unfamiliar " city and the unknown future .
Rural aesthetics
The title of " An Irrational Old Man " makes it plain that it too is a story about an elderly person .
Here , however , Huang has written about a different sort of senior citizen , one who carries within himself a traditional wisdom uncorrupted by modern education .
This wisdom , extremely practical in nature , is part of a piecemeal oral tradition .
It is non-systematic and lacks mechanisms with which to check its own validity .
Nonetheless , when taken as a whole it presents the ideas that there are spirits in the earth and sky , and that the universe is an organic and connected whole .
This is the elderly 's perspective on the universe , and it gives them very different ideas about meaning and beauty .
In dialogue with his grandson Ah - ming , the " Irrational Old Man " passes on his old knowledge : listen to the sound of the waves the wind makes in the rice paddies to discover if the rice is ripe ; fill the bellies of grasshoppers with salt before grilling them ; sparrows are ghosts or spirits which understand human speech ; and killing the lu ti bird brings floods .
At the end , the old man tells the boy of the spirit of the Choshui River , which searches for people to take its place .
In " An Irrational Old Man , " the reader feels very strongly that Huang Chun - ming is playing two roles : that of a little boy listening intently to his grandfather and that of a mature author who longs for the past and wishes to give voice to its earthy old knowledge .
Ah - sheng is the unforgettable elderly protagonist of " Drowning an Old Cat , " the next story in the collection .
Ah - sheng does n't have the life of ease of the " Irrational Old Man , " and he stubbornly resists the encroachment of his enemy , modern life .
In this tragic story , Ah - sheng is ultimately steamrollered by the massive momentum of the new .
But while the tragedy plays itself out , Huang makes it clear to the reader that he stands firmly on the side of Ah - sheng in this conflict .
Not everything in the story is bleak , however .
Huang includes several comic and even farcical scenes , one of which occurs during a carnivalesque town meeting .
There , Ah - sheng demonstrates a startling ability to respond to circumstances and succeeds in wrecking the meeting hall as he makes an eloquent speech on the love of one 's family and birthplace , making " the entire village jump to its feet in agitation . "
And there is a farcical moment at the end as he takes off his clothes and jumps into a private swimming pool , making the ultimate protest by taking his own life .
Old people " let go " by the modern era
This theme of tragedy resulting from changing times has appeared in Huang 's earlier work , in " Cymbal , " for example , which was strongly influenced by Lu Xun 's The Story of Ah Q .
In " Cymbal , " the age of the protagonist , Foolish Chin , is unclear , but the theme of obsolescence remains .
Chin 's work - making announcements in the street while using a cymbal to attract attention - has been made obsolete by the spread of the megaphone , undercutting his social status and taking away his livelihood .
Chin thus takes on the role of a member of the older generation who has lost his struggle to make the transition to modern reality .
Of necessity , his misfortune and his way of thinking have a very " old ' character .
There are reasons to look back to Huang 's early work .
The first is to point out that Letting Them Go - in which the protagonist of every story is an elderly person - is entirely of a piece with his other work .
In fact , it is a return to the main thread of his concerns of 30 years ago .
In the extremely nationalistic atmosphere of the 1970s , Huang changed his focus for a time , writing about the hatred of Japan -LRB- Sayonara , Goodbye -RRB- and about anti-American sentiments -LRB- I Love Mary -RRB- .
Although well received at the time they were written , these works were flawed .
First , they lacked the fine composition of true literature .
Second , in them Huang had moved away from his greatest strength , the characters and settings with which he was truly familiar .
As a result , Huang 's 1970s writings were simply records of the period in which they were written and creative experiments .
They are interesting in their own way , but are by no means among his best works .
Two generations removed
The second reason to look back at Huang 's early fiction is to highlight the continuity of Letting Them Go .
Although it has been more than ten years since Huang 's last collection of fiction , and in spite of the fact that 37 years separate " Cheng - tsai Gets off the Bus " and " Ticket Window , " there is something at the core of Huang 's fiction which has not changed .
In his introduction to Letting Them Go , Huang mentions his deep distress at the plight of the elderly in Taiwan today , notes that he himself is just beginning to enter his twilight years , and compares Taiwan 's callous treatment of the elderly to the way in which the elderly were left to live or die on their own in the mountains in You Shan Jie Kao .
All of this could very easily give the reader the mistaken impression that Huang 's vision of the elderly is a new development .
But this is simply not the case .
In Letting Them Go , what we are actually seeing is the rebirth of Huang 's original passion .
If there has been any change in his portrayal of old people over the last 37 years , it is only in perspective .
He used to write of grandfathers from the point of view of grandsons .
Now he is a grandfather himself .
Huang Chun - ming has often discussed the fact that he was raised largely by his grandparents , and that he had an unusually close relationship to them .
This background accounts for the unique " generation gap " approach utilized by Huang in his fiction .
Each of Huang 's works describes a particular person or thing , and has an " implied reader " at which it is directed .
In the past , Huang 's " generation gap " separated him from the people he was writing about - people of his grandparents ' generation , two generations removed from his own .
Now , this " generation gap " stands between him and the " implied reader " of his fiction - children of his grandchildren 's generation who are ignorant of traditional wisdom .
Another aspect of Huang 's work is that it presents many of the characteristics sociology attributes to relationships between people two generations removed from one another .
For example , such relationships are not usually as tense , direct or hurried as those between parents and children because grandparents are not as busy as parents , and have less responsibility to supervise and teach .
Also , difficulties in communication between grandparents and grandchildren frequently arise because of the very different modes of expression employed by each .
As a result , there are typically more miscommunications in such relationships than there are between parents and their children .
A soft heart
Viewing Huang 's fiction in this way , we can perhaps more clearly see wherein lies its charm .
Huang is never derisive or critical of his elderly characters .
If we compare him to other Nativist writers who address the tragedy of the rural elderly unable to adapt to the modern industrial world , we note that Huang is reluctant to expose his elderly characters to unmitigated suffering .
Other Nativist writers use stories of suffering and pitiable elderly persons to make the case for reform .
Huang takes a much gentler approach - not because he thinks the modern world a perfect place , but because he can not bear to be so harsh .
Huang 's tender - heartedness is apparent to the reader of his work .
In his fiction , Huang is both more sensitive to and places greater importance on the elderly 's haphazard means of expressing affection than are other Nativist writers .
" Fish , " one of his early works , has become very widely known since being incorporated into the national middle - school literature curriculum .
The story describes an unexpected conflict that arises out of a misunderstanding between a child and a grandfather who care deeply for one another .
Similar sorts of emotions are expressed in " Letting Them Go " as well .
In this later story , the elderly Ah - wei inexplicably goes out and catches an egret , then just as inexplicably lets it go .
Both of these actions are indirect expressions of a deep love he can not give voice to yet nonetheless feels for his son Wen - tung .
A smile and a tear
When Huang writes of sad events , his readers ' eyes really do fill with tears .
However , the most exceptional thing about Huang as a writer is that he is not satisfied with making his readers cry .
He wants every tear that falls to be accompanied by a small smile .
And he is able to have it both ways because of the deep and tender sympathy of his work .
The stories in Letting Them Go are filled with elderly characters .
Some are ignorant and suffer , like the old woman of " Cheng - tsai Gets off the Bus . "
But more of them are , like the protagonist of the " Irrational Old Man , " full of a wisdom unsuited to the times in which they live .
Their tragedy is that they are out of step with the times , that they do not know how to adapt to this cold and chaotic new society .
The comedy of their predicament grows out of their unwillingness to let go of the " old " wisdom and " old " ways that they have treasured for so long , out of their flaunting of this " old " knowledge , and out of their use of their " old " assumptions to guess their way through the " new " world .
Their guesses are all wrong , of course , but in their creation of misunderstanding upon misunderstanding , we see a different kind of dignity .
And in this " old " wisdom and these " old " ways , we also see a light that time can not dim .

Soldier Ants : Maysing Yang Calls for NGO Mobilization
Maysing Yang , vice chair of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ' Research and Planning Board , lived for many years in New York .
She joined Taiwan 's political opposition movement very early in her career , and for a time chaired the Democratic Progressive Party 's Foreign Affairs Committee .
After the DPP gained control of the central government , in view of Yang 's long overseas experience of diplomatic affairs and the overseas Chinese community , she was recruited into the cabinet to take over the important position of vice chair of the MOFA 's Research and Planning Board .
In late August 2000 , Maysing Yang and presidential advisor and former DPP chairman Peng Ming - min led a delegation to attend the 53rd Annual DPI / NGO Conference of the United Nations Department of Public Information .
She became the first serving MOFA official to enter the UN headquarters building since the ROC left the UN .
When news of this got out , the PRC delegation at the UN immediately pro-tested , and demanded that the two should leave the conference chamber and be excluded from the UN building .
The next day , showing commendable courage , Yang and Peng slipped back into the conference chamber .
But their actions also attracted the criticism that this kind of high - decibel display is not in fact helpful for achieving Taiwan 's return to the United Nations .
However , Yang does not subscribe to this view .
Enthusiastic , outspoken and full of vitality , she is highly optimistic about Taiwan 's prospects for participation in UN - associated NGOs , and believes that as temples of popular campaigning , NGOs can develop the strength of the Taiwanese people .
Below she describes her views .
After the new government took office , apart from being briefed on our diplomatic partners and on countries with which we do n't have diplomatic relations , I also looked at civic organizations with which the MOFA has contacts and which are frequently active in the international community .
I discovered that the World League for Freedom and Democracy is a well - run international organization with a complete organizational structure , is a member of the UN 's Department of Public Information , and attends the Annual DPI / NGO Conference every year .
This year too it was planning to attend the millennium edition of the conference .
Therefore when Professor Peng invited me to attend , I agreed to join the delegation as an advisor to the league .
The MOFA was very excited about my attending the conference , because we can say that this is the first time a MOFA official has entered the UN headquarters building in the last 30 years .
Everyone thought it was a great breakthrough .
I also took the opportunity to personally get an understanding of how the DPI / NGO Conference works , and of the direction of mainstream international thinking , and I collected a lot of relevant information in the form of conference materials .
Thus we gained a great deal from attending .
One of the main topics at this year 's conference was the issue of how to go about monitoring how governments put into action their ideals and their promises to their peoples .
Another main focus of discussion was the partnership between NGOs , national governments and the UN itself .
These are all very important things for Taiwan to be thinking about , so we ought to participate more .
The UN itself is an organization of national governments .
At present we are excluded , and that is very difficult to change .
NGOs represent a very good point of access .
Today there are a tremendous number of NGOs .
They hold frequent conferences , and they have an ever - growing influence on governments .
For example , a couple of months ago I went to Warsaw to attend the International Forum on Democracy .
The forum was attended by foreign ministers from over 100 countries , but it was also an NGO conference .
Those attending included the great American entrepreneur George Soros , who funded the forum , the former US ambassador to Beijing , Winston Lord , and so on - all high - ranking , highly influential people .
In other words , NGOs are very broad church .
Retired diplomats , business - people , social campaigners , academics and all kinds of foundations may be involved in NGOs .
NGOs can be more powerful than governments , so governments certainly ca n t afford to ignore them .
At present , apart from the World League for Freedom and Democracy , a number of other NGOs in Taiwan are associated with the UN , including women 's , aboriginal and academic groups .
We hope that in the future more groups will actively develop an international profile , and apply to register with the UN .
Another way people in Taiwan can actively participate in international affairs is by encouraging people of ability and influence in society to apply to join the UN 's own NGOs , such as population , human rights , peace and environmental groups , so that they can contribute their knowledge , and at the same time let others better understand people from Taiwan .
We are living in an age of people power , and the UN is responding to the trends of our time .
In the past , NGOs merely played a monitoring role at the UN , but now the trend is towards their involvement in policy implementation .
Hence in our future approach to the UN , besides continuing to press for admission by mobilizing our diplomatic partners to speak on our behalf , we should also actively seek to make the most of the power of our people .
In particular , in the age of the Internet , universal values such as humanitarianism and human rights transcend the narrow confines of national boundaries and nationalism .
The Taiwan issue is one of basic human rights .
In other words , the people of Taiwan are being denied the right to speak and vote in international affairs .
We can use the Internet to gain the support of international champions of justice .
Furthermore , among Taiwanese compatriots living overseas there are many who opposed the old government , but are willing to support the new .
These people are excellent partners through whom we can participate in UN NGOs .
We should n't be afraid of the Chinese communist regime 's attempts to suppress such activity
.
They wo n't last forever , and they ca n't discourage everyone who supports us .
Taiwan 's Fitness Market
Gets Pumped Up

In the last few years , Tai - wan has been swept by a fitness fad .
Clubs offering workout facilities have sprung up incredibly quickly , so that now , counting both established firms and newcomers , there are more than 700 separate locations !
In the midst of an economic downturn , the fitness business is remarkably robust .
It is especially noteworthy that in this new century large foreign health clubs have set their sights on the Taiwan market , hanging out their well - known shingles in a battle for market share with local firms .
This struggle has brought the fitness market to a fever pitch , and also is sparking new and diversified ideas about health in Taiwan .
" A health club is a playground for adults , that 's what it is ! " says Mr. Wu , a florist .
This health club in Taipei 's fashionable eastern district , with its stylish lighting and blasting music , is more like a discotheque .
Mr. Wu has just completed his step aerobics class .
As he catches his breath , he says that he never much liked exercise , but that in the half year since joining the club his life has been dramatically transformed .
Not only is his body slimmed down , but he looks and feels much more energetic .
Recreational fitness
" At first I came just to get in shape .
I signed up with a group of friends who talked me into it .
But it 's fantastic here .
Every time I enter the club and hear that pounding music , I get a rush .
And with so many different and fun aerobics classes , exercise is n't hard labor anymore , " he says .
And thanks to joining the club , the naturally shy Wu has made a lot of new friends .
In another club which offers a swimming pool and " spa " services -LRB- like mineral baths or massage -RRB- , a group of middle - aged ladies who work out in the afternoons sit by the side of the pool enthusiastically talking about the best way to reduce fat around the waistline .
Mrs. Wang declares : " Coming to the health club together is now the most frequent way we neighbors socialize .
Plus by keeping slim you are less likely to get diseases connected to obesity , and you can look younger to boot ! "
Within the last year , gleaming new health centers have set up shop in the Tong Lin Department Store in the Eastern District , the NOVA shopping center near the train station , and the Spring Galaxy theater complex in Hsimenting .
In order to keep up with the competition , the Far Eastern , Sincere , and Asiaworld department stores will also go into business with health centers this year .
And that 's just in Taipei .
Meanwhile , numerous gyms , billing themselves as " recreation clubs , " have opened in the cities of Taichung , Tainan , and Kaohsiung .
A national movement
Seeking to find market niches , various clubs are targeting specific market segments .
Some are for women only .
Others , like California Fitness Centers and Gold 's Gym , set up in commercial districts , aiming for office workers .
Alexander , an island - wide chain , is family - friendly , open to all ages .
Agora Garden , which commands steep prices , combines fitness with business conferencing functions .
The variety is bewildering and the numbers - now more than 700 locations around Taiwan - are astonishing .
Rex , an overseas Chinese from South Africa , who began his career as a trainer at California Fitness Centers , took notice of this wave beginning to build three years ago , and returned to Taiwan to devote himself to the local market .
Analyzing the current direction , he says that global trends and the explosion in media have brought Western ideas of beauty to Taiwan , and the ideal of the " firm and healthy " physique is driving Taiwan consumers into the gym .
" People in Taiwan are beginning to accept that a beautiful body requires effort , and you are n't going to get a sculpted physique with vibrating massage chairs , beauty parlors , or weight - loss pills , " he says .
But people in Taiwan have never had the idea , now common in the West , that physical fitness should be part of the routine of life .
A sculpted body alone is unlikely to be enough to get people motivated to work out -LRB- otherwise you would n't see people spending so much money at beauty parlors for a quick fix -RRB- .
This is why multi-functional health centers - offering health , a good body , fun , and socializing - are driving the market , so that working out has become a fashionable leisure - time activity , and Taiwanese , never known for their love of athletics , are heading in droves to have fun at the gym .
Local vs. foreign
In general , you could divide the main orientations of Taiwan gyms into two basic types : local and Western .
Large health centers which are backed by local investors and managed by local people focus on combining the long - held beliefs that fall under the traditional Chinese idea of " health cultivation . "
These types of gyms incorporate spa , beauty , aromatherapy , and recreational functions under one roof .
Tang Ya - chun , chairwoman of the largest local chain , Alexander Health Clubs , which has 20 locations island - wide , says that the habit of working out must be cultivated over the long term .
Many people join with a sudden burst of interest , but drop out halfway .
In order to keep business going , and keep people coming habitually over the long term , it is necessary that health centers appeal to customers with " freebies " - meaning gain with no pain .
" If health centers can offer not only working out but also recreational functions , then members will keep coming back , " says Tang .
" Modern urban life is stressful and fast - paced , and sometimes a member may be more in need of the relaxation provided by a sauna or aroma - therapy .
Then next time they 'll come back for a workout . "
A mix of freebies and challenges is better at keeping consumers ' motivation high .
While they share the ambition of attracting more people to their ranks , foreign chains nonetheless take a different approach .
Right now the most noteworthy foreign group in Taiwan is California Fitness Centers , which now has three gigantic branches .
Asian regional CEO Eric Levine says that he does not agree with offering spa and aromatherapy facilities in a gym , because these encourage " laziness . "
But it can not be denied that working out is a relatively new concept in Asia .
Hence , California 's approach is to make exercise " recreational " and " fashionable . "
As Levine explains : " We have deliberately put more lighting and decor into our Asian locations , and placed them in the busiest shopping districts , in hopes that working out will become fashionable , and going to the gym will be like going to a good pub .
We want it to be more cool , more exciting , and more fun than a traditional gym , and for members to come to the center with the same attitude they take shopping for Chanel or Prada . "
Levine says that working out is already part of life in the West , so people do n't go to the gym to socialize .
But Asians prefer group activities , and as a result California is putting more emphasis on aerobics classes , with classes every hour all day , so that members can join in any time .
Each center also has dozens of trainers who provide free advice or paid workout supervision .
When East meets West
No matter what tack operators may take to attract consumers , large health centers provide mainly the same services .
Besides traditional equipment for weightlifting and cardio - pulmonary exercises , most have made aerobics the centerpiece in the new fitness fad .
There are all kinds , such as martial arts aerobics , step aerobics , Latin aerobics , and weight - enhanced aerobics .
As their names suggest , these classes modify traditional aerobic dance by adding martial arts moves , step platforms , Latin rhythms , dumbbells , and other props , thereby placing the focus of the workout on different muscle groups .
In addition , aerobics centers commonly provide classes in Asian health techniques like yoga , tai - chi , and qigong .
" Yoga and tai - chi have not been added just for Taiwan , " says Eric Levine .
In fact , the trend in fitness is toward a more Oriental approach , such as the inclusion of martial arts or " power yoga " into aerobics .
There is little tradition of athletics in Taiwan , and it is too early to talk about any uniquely local forms that can be incorporated into Western workouts .
But it is interesting to observe how differences in definitions of beauty have affected exercise preferences .
Rex , with his many years of training experience , finds it especially notable that " women in Taiwan do n't really go for the American female approach of developing muscular bodies .
They prefer lithe bodies , and as a result they are much more into aerobics than weight training .
Most guys in Taiwan , meanwhile , focus on the upper body , and are looking for form , rather than aiming to be hugely muscular . "
Healthy consumption ?
You might think that local health centers , with more attention to relaxation and " health cultivation , " would attract a higher age bracket , while foreign centers , with the accent on fashion and novelty , would draw the younger crowd .
But these lines do not necessarily define how consumers choose .
Cheng Chia - cheng , who has just finished his military service and is preparing for the bar exam , says that his main consideration in choosing a center was location and convenience .
He does n't like the crowded feeling of the shopping district .
" When you work out , the atmosphere should be calm , so that you can use different equipment when you need to and your concentration is n't broken by disturbances . "
Liang Yung - hwa , manager of the Yungho branch of the Eslite bookstore , who has been working out for five years now , says that the new clubs spend too much money on lighting and on equipment that people who are really serious about working out never use , so the membership fees are three to four times those of the older gyms .
He declares : " The lives of city people are incredibly busy , and it 's already a luxury to have an hour a day to work out , so there is n't much time to waste on stuff that is purely for recreation .
But if you consider that it costs NT$ 20,000 in annual fees , plus the initial membership price of another NT$ 10 - 20,000 - altogether about a month 's salary for an office worker - most of that money is wasted . "
With consumers like him , who do n't throw their money around , despite the proliferation of new health centers , traditional gyms have not been badly affected .
Chen Ting - yin , the proprietor of the Taipei Gym , which has been going strong for 16 years now , says that the fitness fad is good for all exercise enthusiasts : " Ten or so years ago people had to scrape together a bunch of odds and ends of free weights , which of course limited how much could be done .
Now there are machines available for training each particular muscle . "
Though , he adds , there is also such a thing as too much equipment of little value .
Fitness or foolhardiness ?
Fitness is a worthwhile investment as well as being a fad .
But blind following of fads can lead to an outcome exactly opposite to the one desired .
Chung Pei - chen , chairwoman of the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine at the Taiwan Adventist Hospital , says that from time to time whole families take up special offers and join together , but , in her opinion , health club facilities -LRB- except for swimming pools -RRB- are not necessarily suitable for all age groups .
" People over 50 or under 16 can easily hurt themselves lifting heavy weights , so I tell people not to be foolhardy , " she says .
The muscles of older people are less securely attached to their bones , and unless a person has been working out since a young age , sudden intense exercise can lead to a deterioration of cartilage , with more damage than benefit for the body .
As for children , they tend to think of exercise as just a kind of play , with accidents often resulting because of fooling around .
Dr. Chung suggests that fitness should begin when young , and those who start very late should stick to swimming , fast walking , and exercise bikes , which are of moderate intensity .
And she adds , " It 's more natural just to exercise when and where you can in daily life - take a walk in the park , climb the stairs . . . . "
Be that as it may , walking in the park is no substitute for a sustained workout program .
Chiang Li - hua , a sales manager in a high - tech industry who has been working out for 15 years , from the earliest Clark Hatch Fitness Center to the health and beauty center in a hotel today , says that people who work out for a long time truly love exercise , love themselves , and are seeking a better quality of life .
This is a habit that is well worth investing in , and people should force themselves to go .
" It 's better to invest in training your body than to spend time and money on medical care when you get sick , " she says .
As for the future , health club managers are optimistic about the potential market .
Eric Levine relates that the Tong Lin branch of California has more members than any of their branches anywhere in the world .
Working out is not like other consumer behavior : The demand for exercise among modern people will only increase , not decline .
It seems that at least as far as the operators are concerned , Taiwan health clubs are certainly working out .

Taiwan Rushes Aid to Quake - Stricken El Salvador
-LRB- Tsai Wen - ting / tr. by David Mayer -RRB-
El Salvador , an ROC diplomatic ally in Central America , was hit on January 13 by an earthquake measuring between 7.4 and 7.9 on the Richter scale .
The earthquake killed hundreds and left tens of thousands homeless .
As soon as reports of the earthquake came in , the ROC government donated US$ 200,000 to support disaster relief efforts , and within 24 hours had dispatched a team to help rescue victims .
It truly does seem that " when it rains , it pours , " for India was then visited on January 26 by its biggest earthquake in 50 years , and according to official estimates the death toll may rise to over 20,000 .
Although the ROC does not have official ties with India , as Sinorama went to press on January 29 rescue teams from Taiwan were standing by for departure , awaiting only the go - ahead from India .
Just short of noon on Saturday , January 13 , most everyone in El Salvador was at home preparing for lunch when the earth below their feet suddenly began to shake violently .
Just outside the capital of San Salvador , a hillside collapsed in the community of Las Colinas , burying more than 260 homes and 1,200 residents .
As of January 29 , the confirmed toll from the earthquake stood at 726 dead and 4,440 injured , with 120,000 homes either totally or partially destroyed and more than 980,000 left homeless .
Over 600 aftershocks have hit El Salvador since January 13 .
The difficulty of emergency rescue efforts has been greatly exacerbated by collapsed road surfaces and interrupted power , water , and telephone services .
President Carlos Flores declared a state of emergency , called for an all - out effort to save lives , and asked for international relief assistance .
Hell on earth
Relief teams and supplies began arriving from around the world on the day after the quake .
In addition to teams from nearby Mexico , Guatemala , and Venezuela , a Spanish team also arrived very quickly , followed soon thereafter by counterparts from Panama , Nicaragua , Germany , France , and Turkey .
The Taipei City Government 's international search and rescue team arrived on January 16 .
This team , which had received three months of training in the US last year , went immediately into action after their long air trip , as the search and rescue command center in El Salvador arranged for it to head to Las Colinas , where the worst of the disaster had taken place .
The team started out using advanced equipment capable of detecting signs of life under the rubble , including flexible fiber optic video cables and ultra-sensitive audio devices .
When these methods did not yield survivors , the team began digging and using more aggressive search techniques .
These methods , too , failed to turn up any sign of life .
At that point relief teams went into Las Colinas with bulldozers and mechanical shovels to clear out the rubble and retrieve the bodies of the dead .
In his condolence message to El Salvador , ROC President Chen Shui - bian stated that the people of Taiwan , having suffered a terrible earthquake of their own in September 1999 , were acutely aware of what people in El Salvador were going through .
In addition to the relief assistance provided by the ROC government , a lot of aid also poured forth from the private sector .
The ROC Red Cross Society donated 10,000 blankets and 400 tents .
The Chinese Children 's Fund is planning to send US$ 300,000 in private donations via the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to provide support for 2,000 children .
The governments of Taichung County and Nantou County , which were hardest hit by the 1999 earthquake in Taiwan , also made big contributions to the relief effort .
Teams from these areas arrived in El Salvador armed with experience , an advanced global positioning system , and tunneling equipment .
They also donated tents and other necessities .
In the dark days following Taiwan 's September 1999 earthquake , the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies donated US$ 27,890,000 to Taiwan , and these funds proved a tremendous help in our reconstruction effort .
International relief teams worked around the clock to find survivors , and thousands made homeless by the quake sheltered from the cold in donated tents and sleeping bags .
Even the dead in many cases were transported to their final resting places in donated body bags and coffins .
Now that a similar disaster has been visited upon one of our diplomatic partners , it is time for the ROC to repay its debt to the international community .
The power of nature
Major earthquakes in recent years have claimed nearly 20,000 lives in Turkey and over 2,500 in Taiwan .
The death toll in El Salvador is expected to climb to over 1,300 .
In the meantime , the Richter 7.9 earthquake in India 's western state of Gujarat has completely leveled the town of Bhuj , and official sources expect the death toll to exceed 20,000 .
While relief teams have been dispatched from around the world , India indicated that it would not need assistance from Taiwan for the time being .
There is nothing anyone can do to prevent earthquakes from occurring , but specialists have noted that the consequences of the recent quakes were made worse by man - made factors , such as overpopulation , environmental degradation , and shoddy construction .
El Salvador is the most densely populated nation in Central America , with some 6 million people living in a territory covering over 20,000 square kilometers -LRB- about two - thirds the size of Taiwan -RRB- .
The economy has been developing briskly ever since the country 's long civil war came to an end in 1992 , and El Salvador plays an important political role both internationally and in the Central American region .
In these respects , El Salvador 's situation is very similar to that of Taiwan .
Overdevelopment of the hillside at Las Colinas may have been one cause of the landslide that buried the residential neighborhood down below .
After one has seen so many dead bodies and heard the anguished wailing of bereaved relatives , it is hard to ignore the wisdom of calls to live in harmony with nature .
It takes a very long time to recover from an earthquake .
After the search and rescue operations have come to an end , reconstruction begins .
This is a massive undertaking that never proceeds quickly .
In a message to the international community , President Flores stated , " I hope that relief assistance has not come to an end .
It should continue as we work on reconstruction . "
If anyone in Taiwan wishes to contribute to reconstruction in El Salvador , they are urged to contact the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ' task force on reconstruction -LRB- tel : 02 - 2348 - 2192 or 02 - 2348 - 2195 -RRB- .

What Price Public Art ?
-LRB- Tsai Wen - ting / tr. by Christopher MacDonald -RRB-
The art market in Taiwan has tended to focus on oil painting and ink - and - wash , with relatively little interest in sculpture , photography , ceramics and multimedia .
However , tens of millions of NT dollars have now become available for work in a range of forms , under the provisions of a 1992 law requiring at least one percent of the budget for major infrastructure projects to be spent on public art .
As a result , artists from Taiwan and abroad have been scrabbling for a slice of the public art pie .
In Taipei , 1997 was designated as the Year of Public Art , and the following year experimental installations went on display at nine cultural centers around the island , chosen by the Council for Cultural Affairs -LRB- CCA -RRB- .
1998 also saw the adoption of new measures governing the installation of such works .
As public art began to proliferate , university departments of art , environment and architecture , spurred by demand , began offering public art courses .
Golden opportunity
The development of a number of major infrastructure projects , including the Taipei MRT system , the Second Northern Freeway and the new terminal at CKS Airport , released millions - even hundreds of millions - of NT dollars for spending on public art , creating a golden opportunity for eager artists .
During 1999 , 30 works of public art were completed in line with official provisions , at a cost of NT$ 40 million .
But the budget for yet - to - be - installed works is even more staggering : NT$ 100 million for public art at the new CKS Airport terminal alone , NT$ 85 million for spending by the Kaohsiung port authority , and NT$ 80 million for stations along the Wanhua - Panchiao branch of Taipei 's MRT network .
At a time of bleak economic prospects , public art commissions have become a beacon for artists .
No wonder some prefer to enter public art contests rather than accept the honor of selection committee membership .
The fact that the contest for nine works to be placed along Taipei 's " Tunhwa Art Corridor , " organized by Taipei 's Urban Development Department , drew entries from over 130 artists , shows how intense the competition can be .
And it is sculptors who have been the biggest beneficiaries of the new policies , since three - dimensional art is the most suitable form for installation in open spaces : of the 55 public art works completed in 1998 , 40 were works of sculpture .
Art engineering ?
At present , public art is chosen through one of four methods : open competition , invitation to tender , commissioning , and direct purchase .
The process has to involve a selection committee from the CCA or relevant cultural department at the local level , comprising artists , architects , landscape designers , art educationalists and so on .
The committee appraises works for artistic quality , suitability for the location , safety and feasibility .
Entries which pass the first round are presented for public demonstration and discussion among the community , so as to avoid subsequent protests .
Unlike those working with other forms of art , the creators of public art need to have a grasp of architectural structure , environmental scenery and even accounting procedure .
Artistic conception alone is not enough .
They will be submitting expenditure claims and dealing with issues including long - term maintenance and cleaning , and maybe utility supply .
A number of artists have thus found it helpful to pool their talents , setting up workshops geared chiefly to the production of public art .
Priceless art ?
Transparency and professionalism in the public art selection process should be beneficial to the overall art environment in Taiwan .
But Huang Wen - ching , a number of whose works have been successfully selected , points out that artists still have to overcome frequent misunderstandings , such as when the cost of their material
Chinese New Year in the Southern Hemisphere
-LRB- by Lin Ying - hua , Auckland , New Zealand / tr. by Christopher MacDonald -RRB-
It was the middle of summer in New Zealand , and the time for celebrating Chinese New Year .
There are plenty of Asian immigrants on the east side of Auckland , and if New Zealanders can have Christmas on a sweltering hot day , then why should n't we Asians do something to mark our traditional New Year ?
Thus it was that the United Asian Association -LRB- UAA -RRB- and the Hua - Hsia Association - a Taiwanese organization - organized the " Celebrating Oriental New Year " event .
To our surprise , over 10,000 visitors came for the performances , along with a number of leading politicians including Prime Minister Jenny Shipley and the mayor of Manukua .
The event took place outdoors in Howick Domain and lasted over five hours .
In addition to the Hua - Hsia Association , groups representing Korea , the Philippines , Malaysia and other Asian countries participated .
The stage was meticulously decorated , with Chinese lanterns hanging from the canopy and a scarlet imperial robe draped against the black backdrop , creating a very Chinese atmosphere .
There were folk dances performed in traditional Chinese costume , and towards the end , a spectacular dragon dance given by members of the Hua - Hsia Association .
The sound of gongs and drums filled the air , along with clapping and gasps of admiration from the audience .
Not many knew how much hard work had gone on behind the scenes for this successful cultural event .
Support from the then - representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in New Zealand , R.C. Shih , was an important element in the event 's success .
The chairman of the UAA , Sharon Stewart , is a New Zealander who is very fond of Asian culture .
She holds regular seminars for new immigrants , and was recently awarded the Queen 's Service Medal in recognition of her dedication .
The UAA holds a " Celebrating Oriental New Year " event at this time every year as a way of encouraging cultural interchange , but every year it is a struggle to find co-sponsors willing to provide funding .
On this occasion , R.C. Shih 's support led to the event being jointly presented by the Hua - Hsia Association and the UAA .
With the Hua - Hsia Association 's committed support there were more than 30 snack booths present , giving the event the lively feel of a Chinese temple celebration .
The foreigners [ non-ethnic Chinese ] present were amazed in particular by the mass dragon dance that members of the Association performed .
A few years ago , when New Zealand was newly opened up to immigration and there were n't many Chinese around , hardly anyone had heard of the Hua - Hsia Association , and inviting government officials to attend such events was always fraught with difficulty .
As more and more Asian immigrants arrived , members of Parliament - vying for votes - began participating enthusiastically in the Association 's events .
The fact that the Association has supported charitable causes in New Zealand for many years , donating time and money , has been especially important in terms of getting taken seriously by the government , and it is thanks to the efforts of immigrants from Taiwan that successes like the New Year celebration have become possible .
For our family , it was our tenth year in New Zealand since arriving as immigrants .
Our daughter had just turned ten and our son was starting primary school when we came here .
During the tough years as new immigrants we overcame numerous difficulties of language and culture , working to establish ourselves in this foreign land .
We wanted our children to quickly adapt to the Western world but without forgetting their Chinese roots , so we endlessly reminded them that we will always be " descendants of the Yellow Emperor , " and urged them to merge into Western society with the characteristic tenacity and humanity of Chinese people .
When the UAA was first set up in 1995 , Sharon came to our house in need of assistance from the Chinese community , filled with enthusiasm but uncertain about how to make contact with the Chinese .
Our daughter has been Sharon 's pal ever since , and it was she who suggested that Sharon see R.C. Shih about a co-sponsor for this year 's New Year celebration .
Several weeks before the event Sharon asked me if I wanted to design a special garland to welcome the prime minister .
As a Howick resident and a floral designer , how could I refuse ?
I used scarlet silk cord and miniature embroidered Chinese slippers -LRB- as used in Chinese knotting -RRB- along with dried flowers , to make a red and gold garland .
As I put it on the premier I explained that these were lucky colors used for Chinese New Year .
She was delighted with this beautiful souvenir , rich in Chinese culture and art , and said she would keep it forever .
With the steady introduction of Chinese culture into this country , New Zealanders are generally more aware of Taiwan than before , and immigrants from Taiwan have been working hard to soften the anti-Asian sentiments of the locals .
When the program of New Year performances wrapped up , many New Zealand friends came forward to express their thanks , saying that they now felt more familiar with China and were eagerly looking forward to next year 's " Howick in the Park " !

The high point of the event came when the prime minister addressed the audience , standing before an imperial Chinese robe .
Teng Hsiang - yang :
Self - made Ethnographer
-LRB- Chang Chiung - fang / photos by Vincent Chang / tr. by David Mayer -RRB-
If you take an interest in the aboriginal tribes of central Taiwan , it wo n't be long before you run into the name of Teng Hsiang - yang .
It matters little what leads to this interest .
You might be filming a documentary or writing a magazine or newspaper article .
You might be engaged in a high - powered research project at Academia Sinica , or just writing a graduate thesis .
In any case , Teng 's copious fieldwork is not something you can afford to ignore .
Among other projects , Teng 's work with the Thao -LRB- also known as the Shao or Sao -RRB- , a tiny aboriginal tribe living in the vicinity of Sun Moon Lake , looms particularly important in the wake of the Chichi earthquake , for the temblor has dealt a heavy blow to a community that now has only 282 members left .
Teng has thrown himself wholeheartedly into the task of rebuilding the one village where the Thao remain .
So who exactly is Teng Hsiang - yang ?
How did he become such an important figure in the academic community ?
Teng Hsiang - yang had originally been planning to catch a flight on September 23 to celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival together with his wife and children .
Little did he know , however , that his plans would be interrupted on September 21 by the biggest earthquake to hit Taiwan in a century .
A giant jolt in the wee hours sent Teng 's apartment building listing and caused the fourth floor to collapse entirely .
On the first floor , where Teng ran a medical testing laboratory , a quake - related power outage prevented him from opening the front door .
He then hung a rope out a third - floor window and lowered himself to safety , injuring his hands slightly in the process .
He was n't too worried about the injuries , nor was the destruction of his laboratory a major concern .
He was , however , extremely anxious to save the results of ethnological fieldwork going back nearly two decades .
For Teng , these materials were priceless treasures .
" Luckily , " says Teng , " I managed to get about 80 - 90 % of it out . "
Taiwan 's great melting pot
A Hakka from the township of Puli , Teng was born in 1951 .
Puli and the nearby rural townships of Yuchih , Kuohsing , and Jen'ai comprise an area known as Shuishalien , where many different ethnic groups have always lived side - by - side .
In addition to Fujianese , Cantonese , Hakkas , and the Pingpu aborigines -LRB- various plains - dwelling aboriginal tribes that have almost completely assimilated into the Han Chinese community -RRB- , the area is also home to many mountain - dwelling aboriginal tribes , including the Atayal , Sediq , Bunun , Thao , Perugawan , Pazeh , Taokas , and Murauts .
Although Teng makes his living by running a medical testing lab , a fortunate combination of circumstances has also sparked an abiding interest in ethnology .
Explains Teng , " I grew up listening to the old folks tell stories about the aboriginal tribes .
There was talk about headhunting expeditions and wars .
They used to scare us kids by saying ' The tribesmen will get you ! ' "
He had frequent contact with aborigines , and many of his best friends in school were aborigines .
After graduating from the Department of Medical Laboratory Science at Chungtai Institute of Health Sciences and Technology , he took up an internship at the Puli Christian Hospital , where many of the patients were also aborigines .
In 1974 , Teng opened a medical testing laboratory in Puli .
Besides providing Teng with a livelihood , the lab also brought him into contact with the aborigines , among whom he would make many friends .
Tajik Bawan , a member of the Atayal tribe , first met Teng ten years ago when he visited the lab for a blood test .
Teng 's reputation preceded him , for Bawan had already heard about " the mugan -LRB- Chinese person -RRB- in Puli who knows a lot about us aborigines . "
Self - trained ethnographer
Living in an ethnically complex area like Puli , Teng has always been very aware of ethnic conflict as well as the fusion and disappearance of cultures .
In 1967 Wei Huei - lin , an anthropology professor at Academia Sinica , asked Teng to take him to interview aborigines .
Teng picked up a lot of valuable fieldwork techniques by watching Professor Wei interview the old folks .
Thereafter , whenever he had any spare time he would go visit the aborigines and chat with the old folks .
Teng 's interest in the Wushe Incident of 1930 -LRB- in which members of several aboriginal tribes killed over 100 Japanese people in the village of Wushe and later met with grave retribution from the colonial authorities -RRB- was piqued when his father gave him two documents on the subject .
" After I started taking an active interest in the Wushe Incident in 1981 , people warned me to be careful . "
Many scholars used to steer clear of Taiwan 's colonial history , but Teng happened to take an interest in the subject just as Taiwanese society was beginning to become more liberal .
The fact that Teng was not a member of the academic community was also fortunate , for it freed him of the pressures that academics must deal with .
Says Teng , " This was about the story of my hometown .
I felt that this research simply had to be done . "
Although an amateur in the field of ethnography , Teng is highly regarded in academic circles for his work in recording the oral history of Taiwan 's aborigines .
His good friend Wang Hao , who teaches in junior high school , jokingly calls Teng " the Puli Center for Ethnographic Fieldwork . "
" When I first started doing my fieldwork there were still about 20 survivors of the Wushe Incident , but they 've all passed away now . "
According to Teng , most of the ones lucky enough to survive were extremely reluctant to talk about it , and it took a long time for him to win their trust , but he did succeed eventually .
" I had a couple of factors working in my favor .
Number one , I was n't a government official , and number two , I work in the field of medicine , so they were n't quite so wary of me . "
After starting off with such subjects as religious beliefs and tribal customs , the old folks slowly got to the point where they were willing to break their silence on more sensitive issues .
Teng does his homework
In the field of anthropology , there has been a growing trend in recent years to rely on the results of field studies to check the veracity of historical records .
Teng Hsiang - yang enjoys close relations with the aborigines , which is why researchers and graduate students interested in studying the Austronesian tribes of central Taiwan always come to Puli to seek Teng 's help .
Teng is a frequent participant in research projects focusing on the aboriginal tribes .
For example , in an Academia Sinica study that ran from 1992 to 1996 and focused on the cultural and kinship ties between Taiwan 's nine main aboriginal tribes , Teng helped to study the Thao and the Pazeh -LRB- a plains - dwelling tribe -RRB- .
According to Hsu Mu - chu , a researcher at Academia Sinica 's Institute of Ethnology , " Teng Hsiang - yang 's status as a member of the medical community and his wide contacts among the aborigines enabled him to make a key contribution to the research project . "
If it had n't been for Teng 's detailed knowledge of the kinship ties in some clans , the researchers would never have been able in some cases to identify pure tribal lineages for study .
Says Teng , " The scholars at the Institute of Ethnology have always given me a lot of support . "
Having received so much help , Teng has practically felt an obligation to make it count .
As a medical technician without formal training in ethnology , Teng 's qualifications for doing fieldwork have been questioned by some , but his work is highly regarded among the specialists at the Institute of Ethnology and the Institute of Linguistics , Preparatory Office , two Academia Sinica bodies with which Teng has worked closely .
According to Hsu Mu - chu , " He is very hard working , and his fieldwork methods come very close to what we ask of academic researchers . "
Hsu points out that Teng 's study of the Thao is especially valuable because no one else has done any fieldwork on this tribe since 1958 .
Teng spent six years recording their religious festivals , marriage customs , property ownership system , land development , etc .
In so doing , he has done much to make up for 40 years of neglect .
According to Hsu , the theoretical framework used by anthropologists must be supported by the results of fieldwork , and Teng has done a very thorough job of providing excellent first - hand materials .
Close observation over an extended period of time by local citizens can make up for the shortcomings of academic research .
Teng is in a better position than a professional researcher to engage in long - term observation of the month - long harvest festival of the Thao , for example , because he lives in the local area .
Thus it is that he has been able to record the Thao tribe 's religious festivals over a long period .
This has been very helpful for researchers .
Hsu Mu - chu is now writing a book on the history of the Thao , and is relying heavily on Teng 's work .
Honorary Sediq
In Hsu 's opinion , it is Teng 's deep concern for his fellow human beings that has enabled him to devote so much of himself for such a long time to his fieldwork .
" It is n't every anthropologist , " says Hsu , " who shows this quality . "
This concern for his fellow human beings has earned Teng many friends among the aborigines .
One such friend is a man named Takken -LRB- Chinese name : Teng Chien - tang -RRB- , the great - grandson of a tribal chieftain .
His grandfather and grandmother were survivors of the Wushe Incident , but they had always been unwilling to talk about the past .
Says Takken , " I had never even heard of the Wushe Incident when I was a kid .
It was only after I entered the university that people gradually started talking about it . "
He points out that it is very unusual for someone , purely out of personal interest and concern , to visit old folks in so many tribes and do a systematic study of their history .
" Our ancestors owe him a great debt . "
Says the teacher Tajis Bawan , " Before I met Teng Hsiang - yang , I did n't have a very clear image of who we were as a people , and I had only heard unsubstantiated rumors and snippets about the Wushe Incident . "
Later , however , he was invited to accompany Teng on his trips to interview old folks in the mountains .
These forays were very moving experiences for Bawan .
" Here this man is not even a member of our tribe , yet he has been spending so much time and effort on our behalf .
How can we be content to know nothing about ourselves ? "
With Teng 's encouragement , Bawan started interviewing old folks on his own and recording his tribe 's eating habits , manner of dress , housing , geographic distribution , arts , folk legends , daily life , and other traditions .
At the same time , there are some Atayal people who view Teng with suspicion , saying , " He 's just another plains dweller trying to make money . "
Others have said , " He 's out to become famous . "
Bawan , too , had once harbored such suspicions , but since getting involved in fieldwork himself , he has discovered how quickly the expenses add up for transportation , development of slides , and so much more .
Not only is it not a money - making proposition , it 's actually a drain on one 's personal finances .
As for fame , Bawan asks , " So what if he has become famous ?
It did n't happen overnight .
During the nearly 20 years that he 's devoted himself to his fieldwork , making a name for himself has been the last thing on his mind . "
To thank him for his contributions to their tribe , Teng 's Atayal friends call him " Hiro , " which means " sun " in Sediq .
Bawan simply considers him a member of the Atayal tribe .
" If we are the Atayal nation , then he is an honorary member of the Sediq . "
-LRB- The Sediq are one branch of the Atayal tribe . -RRB-
The Thao have also conferred similar status upon Teng , whom they call " Ita Thao " -LRB- " one of us Thao " -RRB- .
Kudos and criticism
Teng Hsiang - yang has written a number of articles based on his years of fieldwork , including : " Tracing the Origins of Written Language Among the Plains - Dwelling Aborigines of Puli , " " Why the Languages of the Plains - Dwelling Aborigines of the Puli Basin Have Disappeared , " " The Effect Upon the Thao Tribe of Han Chinese Settlement of the Shuishalien Area . "
He has also written several books , including : " The Wushe Incident , " " Thick Fog , Dark Clouds , " and " The Face of the Thao . "
The Wushe Incident , which was selected as one of the ten best books of the year , provides a comprehensive history of the Wushe Incident and includes many valuable historical photos .
With a keen sense of pathos , Teng writes , " Misunderstandings and hatred born of cultural differences and ethnic divisions were the main culprits behind the Wushe Incident . "
In 1993 Teng won the 16th China Times Prize for Nonfiction for Thick Fog , Dark Clouds - Aftermath of the Wushe Incident for an Atayal family .
Thick Fog , Dark Clouds focuses on the life of Yawai Taimo , daughter of an Atayal chieftain .
In connection with the plan of the Japanese colonial authorities to pacify the " barbarians , " Yawai was married off in 1912 to Sazuka Narusuke , the top - ranking police official in Wushe .
Unfortunately for Yawai , the Wushe Incident of 1930 put people from mixed marriages like hers in a complex predicament .
Amidst the burning ethnic tensions of the time , developing a sense of personal identity was especially difficult for the children , who hardly knew whether to consider themselves Japanese , Taiwanese , Atayal , or Chinese .
Thick Fog , Dark Clouds is the story of innocent , helpless victims of Taiwan 's turbulent history .
Li Jen - kuei , director of Academia Sinica 's Institute of Linguistics , Preparatory Office , wrote as follows in the book 's preface :
" Much has been written about the Wushe Incident , but Teng Hsiang - yang is the only one to do it with such depth and feeling . "
Teng , however , feels rather uncomfortable about winning a prize for nonfiction with his very first book .
" It 's not that my writing was all that good .
The story itself is just very compelling . "
After more than ten years of field research , Teng wrote the book -LRB- over 100 pages long -RRB- in just five evenings and then let his friends read the manuscript .
One of his friends , the highly successful nonfiction writer Liao Chia - chan , had only gotten five minutes into the book before exclaiming , " This is going to win literary prizes ! "
Little did he know that his words would prove prophetic .
Says Liao , " A professional writer could never go that long without writing anything , but Teng Hsiang - yang does n't make his living as a writer , and that enabled him to let the book gradually take shape over a long period of time . "
Right after winning the literary prize , however , Teng was hit with a lawsuit by the grandson of Shimoyama Hiroshi and Sazuka Toyoko , two of the people that Teng wrote about in the book .
The suit charges Teng with seven counts of libel .
Puli 's " ambassador to New Zealand "
The lawsuit was just part of a string of misfortunes for Teng .
A nephew taking part in fieldwork fell into Sun Moon Lake and drowned .
Teng 's older sister , who had cared for him when he was growing up , died from cancer .
Deeply dispirited , Teng put his fieldwork aside and moved to New Zealand with his family in 1995 .
The move was greeted with criticism :
" All that talk about his love for Puli was just a put - on . "
Teng , however , responded , " We are moving to New Zealand mainly for our children 's education .
I myself am not leaving Puli .
In fact , I 'll be bringing the best of New Zealand back here with me . "
In his view , there is much that we could learn from New Zealand , including its emphasis on lifelong learning , and its sorted waste collection .
His good friend Wang Hao jokingly calls Teng " Puli 's ambassador to New Zealand . "
On one visit back home , people who had once collaborated in his fieldwork asked him to help formulate a community development project for Puli , and a group that had taken part in his study of the Thao tribe asked him to get back into fieldwork .
And so it was that the gravity of hometown , friends , and the land pulled Teng back to Puli again .
Leaving his wife and children in New Zealand , he returned to Puli to resume his unfinished work .
" I tried to write in New Zealand , but I do n't know whether it was the easy life or the distance .
I just could n't do it . "
Since returning , however , he still has n't been able to concentrate on his writing .
" I 'm too involved in local affairs .
There are more errands and busywork than I have time for . "
According to Wang Hao , personal relationships in a small town like Puli are very close , and anyone with an outspoken personality ends up getting forced into all sorts of civic responsibilities .
Teng happens to be one of the more outspoken types in Puli .
Teng is the first person that many people meet when visiting Puli .
Not long after Li Chia - tung became president of National Chi - Nan University he made it a point to visit Teng Hsiang - yang and Liao Chia - chan to discuss ways to strengthen relations between the university and the local community .
Teng is thus very well known in Puli , and extremely active in community affairs .
The list of projects in which he has been involved is long :
a comprehensive community development project ; an effort to preserve the Tamalin archeological site ; the writing of the section on aboriginal culture in a textbook on native culture in Nantou ; the Puli Music and Arts Festival ; an effort to persuade Academia Sinica to establish a campus in Puli ; etc .
Passing the torch
Teng had originally set himself a goal of getting his tenth book written and published last year .
With a lot of material on hand , and with a lot of the book already written , all he needed to do was add the finishing touches .
Part of the book focuses on the story of Inoue Hajime , a Japanese doctor whose life Teng has been studying for the past ten years .
Says Teng , " After Inoue 's father met his death in Taiwan at the hands of aborigines on a head hunting expedition , Inoue swore to ' avenge ' his father 's death with kindness .
He ended up living 38 years among the aborigines , not even returning to Japan when his mother passed away .
He finally left Taiwan in 1947 .
When I went to Japan last January and paid my respects at his grave , I discovered that his gravestone was inscribed in Atayal .
I used to cry every time I talked about this wonderful doctor , but I 'm getting a little less emotional about it as time goes by .
I have to hurry up and get the book written . "
Teng had been planning to pass the torch to others , both in community affairs and in his efforts to collect the oral histories of the aborigines .
" I 've done my bit , " said Teng , " and soon it will be time to let the aborigines speak for themselves . "
Then the earthquake threw a wrench in Teng 's plans .
After his medical laboratory was destroyed , Teng characteristically reacted by throwing his energies into the task of rebuilding the local community .
He has kept himself busy preparing posters , organizing a community newspaper , and establishing the " New Puli Community Development Foundation . "
Says Teng , " Puli wo n't let me go ! "
The effort to rebuild the community takes precedence over everything else , so it looks like Teng 's writing plans will have to be postponed .
One thing , however , remains certain -
Teng 's love for Puli and the aborigines will never fade .

The Wushe Incident was a taboo subject for many years in the academic community , but Teng Hsiang - yang 's interest was piqued when his father gave him two documents related to the incident .
p. 96
Teng Hsiang - yang , who grew up in Puli at the foot of Mt. Niumien , has become a walking repository of information on the Atayal and Thao tribes as well as the Han - assimilated descendants of various former plains - dwelling aboriginal tribes .
Anyone interested in doing ethnography in this area is sure to seek Teng 's advice .

Thick Fog , Dark Clouds tells the tale of what befell one Atayal family after the Wushe Incident .
The tides of history played a decisive role in the life of Yawai Taimo , who experienced many dramatic and sometimes tragic twists of fate .

Teng Hsiang - yang can often be found at festivals and ceremonies of the Thao tribe , who have come to regard him as one of their own .
p. 101
Teng Hsiang - yang is more than a friend to the aborigines of Puli .
He also has a hand in looking after their health .
The Thao man pictured here , who has long suffered from gout , has come to ask for Teng 's medical advice .

Teng Hsiang - yang 's medical lab and home were destroyed in the September 21 earthquake .
Teng scrambled among the rubble to save his most highly prized possessions - material gathered over the course of years of ethnographic fieldwork .

After his wife and children moved to New Zealand , Teng Hsiang - yang returned alone for an extended stay in Puli , where his only companionship has been a houseful of research materials .
Taiwan Stands Up :
Moving Toward a Brighter Future
Leaders of our friendly nations , distinguished guests and compatriots from Taiwan and abroad ;
This is a glorious moment ; this is also a solemn moment full of hope .
I thank our distinguished guests , who have come here from afar , as well as those friends from around the world who love democracy and care about Taiwan , for sharing this glorious moment with us .
We are here today , not just to celebrate an inauguration , but to witness the flowering of hard - won democratic values and the dawn of a new era .
On the eve of the 21st century , the people of Taiwan have completed a historic alternation of political parties in power .
This is not only the first of its kind in the history of the Republic of China , but also an epochal landmark for Chinese communities around the world .
Taiwan has not only set a new model for the Asian experience of democracy , but has also added an inspiring example to the third wave of democracy the world over .
The election for the 10th - term president of the Republic of China has clearly shown the world that the fruits of freedom and democracy are not easy to come by .
Twenty - three million people , through the power of determined will , have dispelled enmity with love , overcome intimidation with hope , and conquered fear with faith .
With our sacred votes we have proved to the world that freedom and democracy are indisputable universal values , and that peace is humanity 's highest goal .
The outcome of Taiwan 's year 2000 presidential election is not the victory of an individual or a political party .
It is a victory of the people as well as a victory for democracy , because we have , while attracting global attention , transcended fear , threats and oppression and bravely risen to our feet together .
Taiwan stands up , demonstrating a firm insistence on reason and a sturdy faith in democracy .
Taiwan stands up , representing the self - confidence of the people and the dignity of the country .
Taiwan stands up , symbolizing the quest for hope and the realization of dreams .
Dear compatriots , let 's always remember this moment ; let 's always remember to value and feel gratitude for it , because the fruits of democracy did not come out of the blue .
We reaped the fruits only after we had been subjected to many perils and countless hardships .
If not for the fearless sacrifice of our democratic forebears , if not for the unswerving faith of the tens of millions of Taiwanese people in freedom and democracy , we could not possibly be standing on our beloved land today and celebrating a glorious occasion that belongs to all the people .
Today , it is as if we are standing before a fresh new gate of history .
In the process of democratization , the Taiwanese people have created a brand - new key to our shared destiny .
The new century 's gates of hope are soon to open .
We are humble but not submissive .
We are full of self - confidence but do not have the slightest bit of complacence .
Since that moment on March 18 when the election results came to light , I have accepted the mandate of all Taiwanese people in a most earnest and humble frame of mind , and have vowed to devote all my heart , knowledge and courage to assuming the heavy responsibility for our country 's future .
I personally understand that the significance of the alternation of political parties and of the peaceful transition of power lies not in that it is a change of personnel or political parties .
Nor in that it is a dynastic change .
Rather , it is the return of state and government power to the people through a democratic procedure .
The country belongs to the people , rather than to any individual or political party .
The government and its officials , from the head of state down to the rank - and - file employees , exist for the service of the people .
The alternation of political parties does not mean an across - the - board negation of the past .
We should be fair in evaluating the contributions made by those in power throughout the ages .
Mr. Lee Teng - hui deserves our highest tribute and heartfelt gratitude for his promotion of democratic reforms and for his excellent performance during his twelve years of leadership .
Taiwan society has rallied and participated energetically in the election .
Despite the diverse views and stances , all individuals share the same commitment - to come forward for the sake of their political ideas and the country 's future .
We believe that the end of an election is the beginning of reconciliation .
After the curtain falls on emotional campaigns , rationality should prevail .
Under the supreme principles of national interest and the welfare of the people , those in power and in opposition should both fulfill their mandates given by the people and realize the ideals of fair competition in multiparty politics , as well as the checks and balances of democratic politics .
A democratic society with fair competition , tolerance and trust is the strongest impetus for a nation 's development .
Placing national interests above those of political parties , we should solidify the will of the people and seek consensus among the ruling and opposition parties , to promote the country 's progress and reforms .
" A government for all people " and " rule by the clean and upright " are promises I made to the people during the campaign period .
They are also Taiwan 's key to stepping over its fault lines and rising to a higher level in the future .
The spirit of " a government for all people " lies in the fact that " the government exists for the people . "
The people are the masters and shareholders of the state .
The government should rule on the basis of majority public opinion .
The interests of the people should reign supreme over those of any political party or individual .
I have always taken pride in being a member of the Democratic Progressive Party , but from the moment I take my oath and assume the presidency , I will put all my efforts into fulfilling my role as a " president for all people . "
As in the formation of the new government , we recruit people according to their talents and do not discriminate on the basis of ethnicity , gender or party affiliation .
The welfare of the populace shall be our primary goal in the future .
" Rule by the clean and upright " has as its topmost priority the elimination of " black gold " - the involvement of organized crime and moneyed interests in politics - and the eradication of vote - buying .
For a long time , the Taiwanese people have been deeply repelled by moneyed politics and the interference of organized crime .
Vote - buying in grassroots elections has also robbed the people of their right to elect the wise and the able , and tainted the development of Taiwan 's democracy .
Today , I am willing to promise that the new government will eliminate vote - buying and crack down on " black gold " politics , so that Taiwan can rise above such sinking forces and ensure rule by the clean and upright .
We must give the people a clean political environment .
In the area of government reforms , we need to establish a government that is clean , efficient , far - sighted , dynamic , highly flexible and responsive , in order to ensure Taiwan 's competitiveness in the face of increasingly fierce global competition .
The age of " large and capable " governments has now passed , replaced by one of " small and effective " governments , which have established partnership relations with the people .
We should accelerate the streamlining of government functions and organization and actively expand the role of public participation .
This will not only allow the public to fully utilize its energy but also significantly reduce the government 's burdens .
Similar partnership relations should also be set up between the central and local governments .
We want to break the authoritarian and centralized control over both power and money .
We want to realize the spirit of local autonomy , where the local and central governments share resources and responsibilities , where " the central government will not do what the local governments can . "
Whether in the east , west , north or south , whether on Taiwan proper or on offshore islands , all will enjoy balanced , pluralistic development , and the gap between urban and rural areas will be reduced .
We should understand that the government is no panacea for all ills .
The driving force for economic development and societal progress is the people .
Over the past half - century , the Taiwanese people have toiled hard to create an economic miracle that has won global applause , and to lay the foundation for the survival and development of the Republic of China .
Today , facing the impact of fast - changing information technologies and trade liberalization , Taiwan must move toward a knowledge - based economy .
High - tech industries need to be constantly innovative , while traditional ones have to undergo transformation and upgrading .
In the future , the government should not necessarily play the role of a " leader " or " manager . "
On the contrary , it should be the " supporter " and " service provider , " as expected by private enterprises .
The responsibility of a modern government is to raise administrative efficiency , improve the domestic investment environment , and maintain financial order and stock market stability , so as to allow the economy to move toward full liberalization and globalization through fair competition .
Based on these principles , the vitality of the public will naturally bloom and create a new phase in Taiwan 's economic miracle .
Apart from consolidating democratic achievements , promoting government reforms , and raising economic competitiveness , the new government should , as its foremost objective , closely watch public opinion and implement reforms accordingly , so that the people on this land can live with more dignity , greater self - confidence and a better quality of life .
Let our society not only be safe , harmonious and prosperous , but also follow the principles of fairness and justice .
As we cultivate the ever - growing abilities of our citizens , we will let our next generation learn in an environment filled with happiness and hope .
The 21st century will be a time when " the right to a quality life " and " a refined way of life " are much emphasized .
The government will find solutions for issues relating to the people 's lives , such as law and order , social welfare , environmental protection , land - use planning , waste disposal , river cleaning , transportation and community renewal .
It will also have to implement these solutions thoroughly .
At present , we need to immediately improve law and order and environmental protection , two important indicators of the quality of life .
We will build a new social order so that the people may live in peace without fear .
A balance must be ensured between nature conservation and economic development so that Taiwan may develop into a sustainable green silicon island .
Judicial integrity is the bulwark of political democracy and social justice .
An impartial , independent judiciary is a protector of social order and a defender of the people 's rights .
At present , we still have a long way to go in our judicial reforms .
Our compatriots must continue to keep close watch over the judiciary and voice their expectations .
At the same time , we should also restrain our administrative power and give the judiciary room to operate independently and without interference .
Humans are Taiwan 's most important resources .
Talented people hold the key to the country 's competitiveness , while education is the long - term cause underpinning " accumulating wealth among the people . "
We will soon seek a consensus among the ruling and opposition parties , academia and the public so as to carry on with educational reforms and build a healthy , proactive , lively and innovative educational system , which will allow Taiwan to cultivate an uninterrupted stream of top - notch talents amid the fierce international competition .
We will let Taiwan move gradually toward being a " learning organism " and a " knowledge - based society . "
We will also encourage people to take up lifetime learning to fully develop their potential and creativity .
Grassroots community organizations are now developing around the country , working to explore and preserve the history , culture , geography and ecology of their localities .
These are all part of Taiwan culture , whether they are local cultures , mass cultures or high cultures .
Due to special historical and geographical factors , Taiwan possesses a wealth of diversified cultural elements .
But cultural development is not something that can bring immediate success .
Rather , it has to be accumulated bit by bit .
We must open our hearts with tolerance and respect , so that our diverse ethnic groups and different regional cultures may communicate with each other , and so that Taiwan 's local cultures may connect with the cultures of Chinese - speaking communities and other world cultures , and create a new milieu of " a cultural Taiwan in a modern century . "
The September 21 earthquake that struck last year brought to our land and our compatriots an unprecedented catastrophe , the pain of which is yet to heal .
The new government will brook no delay in the reconstruction of disaster areas , including industrial and spiritual recovery .
We will not cease until the last victim is taken care of and the last destroyed place is rebuilt .
Here , we would like to express our highest respect again for all individuals and nongovernmental organizations that have selflessly lent a hand to the rescue and reconstruction work after the disaster .
Amid the fierce power of Nature , we have seen Taiwan 's most beautiful compassion , strongest faith and greatest trust .
Our compatriots have been injured by the September 21 earthquake , but with the spirit of a " volunteer Taiwan , " Taiwan 's new family will stand up resolutely on its feet once again .
Dear compatriots , 400 years ago Taiwan was called " Ihla Formosa " - the beautiful island - for its lustrous landscape .
Today , Taiwan is manifesting the elegance of a democratic island , once again attracting global attention , as the people on this land create a new page in our history .
We believe that the Republic of China , with its democratic achievements and technological and economic prowess , can certainly continue to play an indispensable role in the international community .
In addition to strengthening the existing relations with friendly nations , we want to actively participate in all types of international nongovernmental organizations .
Through humanitarian care , economic cooperation , cultural exchanges and various other ways , we will actively participate in international affairs , expand Taiwan 's room for survival in the international arena , and contribute to the welfare of the international community .
Besides , we are also willing to commit to a more active contribution in safeguarding international human rights .
The Republic of China can not and will not remain outside global human rights trends .
We will abide by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Convention for Civil and Political Rights , and the Vienna Declaration and Program of Action .
We will bring the Republic of China back into the international human rights system .
The new government will urge the Legislative Yuan to ratify the International Bill of Rights as a domestic law of Taiwan , so that it will formally become the " Taiwan Bill of Rights . "
We hope to set up an independent national human rights commission in Taiwan , thereby realizing an action long advocated by the United Nations .
We will also invite two outstanding nongovernmental organizations , the International Commission of Jurists and Amnesty International , to assist us in our measures to protect human rights and make the Republic of China into a new indicator for human rights in the 21st century .
We firmly believe that at no time , nor in any corner of the world , can the meaning and values of freedom , democracy and human rights be ignored or changed .
The 20th century left us with a major lesson - that war is a failure of humanity .
Waged for whatever lofty purposes or high - sounding reasons , war is the greatest harm to freedom , democracy and human rights .
Over the past one hundred plus years , China has suffered imperialist aggression , which left indelible wounds .
Taiwan has had an even sadder fate , tormented by brute force and colonial rule .
These similar historical experiences should bring mutual understanding between the people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait , setting a solid foundation for pursuing freedom , democracy and human rights together .
However , due to the long period of separation , the two sides have developed vastly different political systems and ways of life , obstructing empathy and friendship between the people on the two sides , and even creating a wall of divisiveness and confrontation .
Today , as the Cold War has ended , it is time for the two sides to cast aside the hostility left from the old era .
We do not need to wait further because there is a new opportunity now for the two sides to create an era of reconciliation together .
The people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait share the same ancestral , cultural , and historical background .
While upholding the principles of democracy and parity , building upon the existing foundations , and constructing conditions for cooperation through good will , we believe that the leaders on both sides possess enough wisdom and creativity to jointly deal with the question of a future " one China . "
I fully understand that , as the popularly elected 10th - term president of the Republic of China , I must abide by the Constitution , maintain the sovereignty , dignity and security of our country , and ensure the well - being of all citizens .
Therefore , as long as the CCP regime has no intention to use military force against Taiwan , I pledge that during my term in office , I will not declare independence , I will not change the national title , I will not push forth the inclusion of the so - called " state - to - state " description in the Constitution , and I will not promote a referendum to change the status quo in regard to the question of independence or unification .
Furthermore , there is no question of abolishing the Guidelines for National Unification and the National Unification Council .
History has proved that war will lead to more hatred and enmity , without the least help to the development of mutual relations .
Chinese people emphasize the difference between statesmanship and hegemony , believing in the philosophy that a government which employs benevolence " will please those near and appeal to those from afar , " and " when those from afar will not submit , then one must practice kindness and virtue to attract them . "
Such Chinese wisdom will remain a universal value .
Under the leadership of Mr. Deng Xiaoping and Mr. Jiang Zemin , the mainland has created a miracle of economic openness .
In Taiwan , over a half century , not only have we created a miracle economy , we have also created the political marvel of democracy .
On such a basis , as long as the governments and people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can interact more , following the principles of " goodwill reconciliation , active cooperation , and permanent peace , " while at the same time respecting the free choice of the people and excluding unnecessary obstacles , both sides of the Strait can make great contributions to the prosperity and stability of the Asia - Pacific region .
Both sides will also create a glorious civilization for humanity .
Dear compatriots , we hope so much to share the moving scene of this moment with all Chinese - speaking people around the world .
The wide Ketagelan Boulevard before us was bristling with security guards only a few years ago .
The building behind me used to be the Governor General 's Mansion during the colonial era .
Today , we gather here to extol the glory and joy of democracy with songs of the land and the voice of the people .
With a little reflection , our compatriots should be able to appreciate the deep and far - reaching meaning of this moment :
Authoritarianism and force can only bring surrender for one time , while democracy and freedom are values that will endure forever .
Only by adhering to the will of the people can we pioneer the paths of history and build enduring architecture .
Today , as the son of a tenant farmer with a poor family background , I have struggled and grown on this land and , after experiencing defeat and tribulation , I have finally won the trust of the people to take up the great responsibility of leading the country .
My individual achievements are minor , but the message is valuable because each citizen of Formosa is a " child of Taiwan " just like me .
In whatever difficult environment , Taiwan will be like a selfless , loving mother , who never stops giving her children opportunities and who helps them realize beautiful dreams .
The spirit of the " child of Taiwan " reveals to us that even though Taiwan , Penghu , Kinmen and Matsu are tiny islands on the rim of the Pacific , the map of our dreams knows no limits .
The map extends all the way to the horizon as long as our 23 million compatriots fear no hardship and move forward hand in hand .
Dear compatriots , this magnificent moment belongs to all the people .
All grace and glory belongs to Taiwan - our eternal Mother .
Together , let 's extend our gratitude to the earth and our respect to the people .
Long live freedom and democracy !
Long live the people of Taiwan !
We pray for the prosperity of the Republic of China , and for the health and happiness of all compatriots and all our distinguished guests !

Nuclear - Free Dream Recedes Amid Inter-Branch Conflict
-LRB- Alexandra Liu / tr. by Robert Taylor -RRB-
Having dragged on since 27 October last year , the furore over the cancellation of the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant project was briefly laid to rest on 13 February 2001 , when Premier Chang Chun - hsiung and Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin - pyng signed an agreement to resume construction of the plant .
However , the controversy over the plant was soon put back in the spotlight by calls for a plebiscite on the issue .
On one side of the argument is the unquenchable thirst for economic advance ; on the other , the long - term ideal of a nuclear - free homeland , and the distress of the people of Kungliao , where the plant is sited .
Standing at the nuclear crossroads , buffeted by the waves of political turmoil sparked by the project , how should Taiwan choose its road for the future ?
On 14 February , in a statement in which he spoke of a " painful choice " and his " undying determination , " Premier Chang Chun - hsiung announced the resumption of work on the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant , and identified the passing of a plebiscite law as the most important topic for renewed cross-party consultation .
He also responded positively to the Legislative Yuan 's indication of its support for the goal of a " nuclear - free homeland . "
With the words : " Developments over the coming ten months will decide Taiwan 's fate for the next 10,000 years , " Chang hinted that the next stage in the antinuclear campaign will be a decisive factor in the Legislative Yuan elections scheduled for the end of the year .
The same day , the cabinet approved the plan to resume construction of the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant , and announced that it would formulate a plan for the phased closure and decommissioning of the three existing nuclear plants , on condition that adequate electricity generating capacity is maintained .
The Executive Yuan would invite a wide range of environmentalist groups and individuals to join a " Nuclear - Free Homeland Guidance Committee " to actively educate the public .
At the cabinet meeting , economic affairs minister Lin Hsin - yi stressed that the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant project would be completed on time in July 2005 .
After the decision to resume work on the plant , legislator Chao Yung - ching said he had never seen another example of a government which on the one hand stressed its desire for a " nuclear - free homeland , " but on the other still finally went ahead with building a nuclear power plant .
On 24 February the Nuclear - Free Country Action Alliance , a coalition of over 100 antinuclear groups , staged a demonstration to call for a plebiscite on the project , to " let the people decide . "
Leading Democratic Progressive party figures such as former party chairmen Lin I - hsiung and Yao Chia - wen , and former secretary - general Chang Chun - hung , took part in the rally .
The saga of the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant began in 1980 , when TaiPower first proposed the project .
But following the worldwide shock at the 1986 Chernobyl explosion , the Legislative Yuan froze the project 's budget .
Since the Yenliao Anti-Nuclear Self - Help Association was set up in 1988 , it and other groups have also fought a running battle with the government over the plant .
The Control Yuan ordered major corrective measures regarding the project three times in 1999 alone , finding that the construction permit was improperly issued , that the environmental impact assessment was made on an incorrect basis , and that proper provision had not been made for safeguarding a Ketagalan aboriginal archaeological site .
These instances are taken as proof by antinuclear groups of the illegality surrounding the project .
Energy policy suggestions
KMT chairman Lien Chan proposed to President Chen Shui - bian the drafting of a " National Energy Development Statute , " based on considerations of national energy supply and demand .
In view of projections that in 2005 northern Taiwan will have a shortfall of close to 2,100 megawatts , construction of the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant should continue , but no further nuclear plants would be built , and the first , second and third plants would be decommissioned on reaching the end of their normal operating lives .
But before that the 11 private power stations already approved for construction should be completed as quickly as possible , and if 2,000 megawatts of substitute generating capacity could be completed , the three older nuclear plants could be decommissioned early .
Lien also expressed the opinion that when formulating its overall energy policy , the new government should give consideration to various factors , including environmental impact and Taiwan 's international reputation .
However , with the resumption of work on the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant , the people of Kungliao Rural Township have nothing to show for more than a decade of protest .
Not only do they feel that they have never had an opportunity for equal dialogue with the government , but also that the fishing grounds on which local fishermen have relied for generations will soon be threatened with major environmental degradation .
According to the research report A Survey of the Natural and Ecological Resources of the Northeast Coast National Scenic Area by Cheng Ming - hsiu , an associate research fellow at the Academia Sinica 's Institute of Zoology , species recorded in the sea off the scenic area include 182 corals , 168 crustaceans , 318 mollusks , 57 echinoderms , 60 large seaweeds , over 290 shellfish and more than 100 other marine organisms such as sponges , sea anemones , jellyfish , polychaetes and sea squirts .
This shows that Yenliao Bay really is one of northern Taiwan 's major marine habitats , and is also one of the places in northern Taiwan where a coastal ecosystem has been preserved relatively undamaged .
Ecological disaster
After work on the plant resumes , there will be neither an immediate nuclear risk nor an immediate benefit of power generation .
But environmentalists are convinced that the marine habitat of Yenliao , lying within a marine resource conservation area immensely rich in both the number of species and their populations , will be devastated , and that the three - kilometer golden beach of fine quartz sand which runs from Yenliao to Fulung , one of the priceless ecological and tourist resources of the northeast coast , may be lost along with it .
Following the Amorgos oil spill , we saw the public and the military working hard to scoop up bucket after bucket of oil .
But what should our mood be when it comes to the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant 's impact on the sea off Kungliao ?
Chen Po - chih , chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development , is one of the cabinet ministers who take the clearest stand against nuclear power .
He stated on 14 February that he once made a risk assessment for nuclear power in Taiwan , taking into consideration the island 's population density , its level of nuclear technology and its level of economic development , and concluded that it was not worth the risk .
But since it would appear from public opinion polls that the majority in Taiwan believe that for economic reasons the plant should still be built , he could only hope that construction standards will be strictly adhered to , and that no accident will ever occur at the plant .
Government , opposition and the public at large , apart from closely monitoring the plant 's construction , can only pray together with Chen that the people 's choice today will turn out for the good of their children and grandchildren .

Little Three Links Presage New Era in Cross-Strait Relations
-LRB- Sharon Wu / tr. by Phil Newell -RRB-
The " little three links " - direct mail , transport , and commerce between the ROC islands of Kinmen and Matsu on the one side and the PRC on the other - were formally opened on January 2 .
-LRB- They were originally supposed to start on January 1 , but were postponed to the 2nd at the request of the PRC . -RRB-
This step is seen as setting the stage for the eventual opening of the full " three links " - direct mail , commerce , and transport between Taiwan proper and the PRC - and for Taiwan 's entry into the World Trade Organization .
But the PRC has remained as chilly as ever , and it is uncertain what breakthroughs and benefits can be realized through the little three links .
It is expected that both Taiwan and the PRC will enter the WTO this year .
Looking ahead , with the alteration of the previous administration 's " no haste " policy , cross-strait trade relations will enter a new era .
On December 20 , Premier Chang Chun - hsiung declared that the opening of the little three links on January 1 was a major part of the government 's mainland policy , and also the prelude to the full three links that will be implemented after WTO entry .
Tsai Ing - wen , chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs Commission -LRB- MAC -RRB- , says that the focus in the first stage of the little three links will be on the issues of public security and the local economy in Kinmen and Matsu .
The first step will be decriminalization and legalization of petty trade .
Only after observing the impact of the first stage on social order and local industries in Kinmen and Matsu will the second stage - opening of normal commercial activities - be considered .
As for the opening of the full three links , there is no particular timetable .
On December 18 , MAC Vice-Chairman Teng Chen - chung stated that the government has already begun planning for the full three links .
Faced with questions raised by some legislators that the government is focusing on the little three links as a tactic to postpone the full three links , Teng declared that the full three links will definitely be implemented , but the first priority is to coordinate these with Taiwan 's WTO entry , with secondary attention going to Taiwan 's own needs .
Most media and commentators have been positive toward the little three links .
In an article published on December 25 , the United Daily News declared that , given the trend of economic globalization , the opening of the three links across the Taiwan Strait should bring unprecedented growth in cross-strait economic ties .
In addition , promoting economic links is something that both sides find acceptable despite the frigid nature of the political relationship .
As the borderless global economy takes shape in the 21st century , the three links will help businesses expand their economic space and encourage industrial upgrading , with both sides benefiting .
But PRC economic experts note that , once both sides enter the WTO , the mainland 's large market will be contested by firms from all over the world .
They say that the transfer of high technology firms from Taiwan to the PRC will aid in construction of a " Chinese economic grouping " which would raise the decision - making status of the two sides in international economic affairs .
On another front , in terms of tourism , in June of 2001 Taiwan expects to implement a new policy allowing mainland tourists to come to Taiwan .
This could be very significant in increasing exchanges and mutual understanding between the two sides .
Most opinion leaders in the PRC view this policy positively .
Beijing 's China Travel Association says that mainland people can now travel for tourism to 15 regions or countries , and it is a shame that Taiwan - which is close geographically and shares a common language and heritage - has never been open for mainland travelers .
A recent opinion poll in the PRC shows that 25 million people there say that they would rather visit Taiwan than any other tourist destination .
Mt. Ali -LRB- Alishan -RRB- and Sun Moon Lake are the places in Taiwan they would most like to visit , and they also are looking forward to eating authentic Taiwan cuisine and drinking genuine " pearl milk tea . "
Unfortunately , not only have the mainland authorities not responded enthusiastically to the little three links , they have even attacked the policy .
On December 28 , Zhou Mingtong , vice-director of the State Council 's Taiwan Affairs Office , stated at a banquet for Taiwan media that the little three links are " small potatoes . "
Li Yafei , secretary - general of the PRC 's Association for Relations Across the Strait , said that the mainland does n't even have the concept or term " little three links , " and that the key to the " three links " remains the " one China " principle .
Looking to future cross-strait interactions , the opening of the three links -LRB- at least for tourism and economic interactions -RRB- does not have to get bogged down in the debate over independence vs. reunification , and has in fact already become a new consensus between the two sides .
The success of the relevant government policies in conforming to public opinion and building healthy cross-strait relations , and the PRC 's willingness to tone down the rhetoric and make peace the top priority , will be decisive in creating a win - win situation and in reinvigorating the economy .

Money for Nothin' ...
But It 's Not Risk Free
-LRB- Laura Li / photos by Hsueh Chi - kuang / tr. by Phil Newell -RRB-
It is said that the two hottest subjects in post-martial law Taiwan have been sex and personal money management , which certainly goes to show the degree of openness and pluralism in today 's society .
Moreover , like sex , personal money management is something that many people only vaguely understand , that they feel uncertain about committing themselves to , and that leaves them feeling tired and empty .
Personal money management is now a national sport .
The wealthy hope to roll their money over , while those less well off are trying to make a small pile of their own .
But what kind of money management approach is best suited to the current era ?
How can one win in the investment game without losing the game of life in the process ?
" Earning money is the first priority , spending money is a sin , long live personal money management ! "
Thus declares a poster on the wall of a certain " Miss Chen , " a secretary in a trucking company in Pingtung .
Every night before going to sleep she turns on her computer to check out the closing share prices for the Taiwan Stock Exchange and the opening figures for the US exchanges , and then makes a quick calculation in her head of her total wealth .
This woman , who is nearing 30 and has been working for seven years , has a " personal value " which is still less than NT$ 600,000 , so in order to build up a fund for investing , she will not buy a house or go abroad for travel , and she 's becoming a Scrooge in the eyes of her friends .
Yet , all her discipline and her enthusiasm can not guarantee that she makes money .
And sometimes when she looks at the poster on her wall , she feels as if she is being mocked .
If I knew then what I know now ...
Liu Li - chih , a 25 - year - old teacher , is another e-generation personal money management enthusiast .
Even before he did his compulsory military service , he began making investments of NT$ 3,000 per month in a Japan technology fund .
Over three years , the fund has gone from taking losses to taking off ; though it has levelled off somewhat lately , the returns have been excellent .
Liu declares himself to be " a faithful believer " in all manner of personal money management books , and when he has free time in summer vacation , he spends an average of 20 hours a week looking at investment information .
His greatest regret is that he began his financial career too late .
He says : " If I had used my allowance every year from the time I was small to invest in a fund , at the rate of NT$ 30,000 per year , after 20 years , there would be quite a lot of money right now . "
Becoming increasingly agitated , he adds that if he had understood money management early on , he could have invested right after the big stock market collapse in 1990 , and he would be rich today instead of regretful .
It looks like more and more of the e-generation are getting into investing .
But do they know what they are doing ?
Dennis Chien of the money management website called JP Investment Clinic strikes a cautionary note : " I do n't think the education system has fulfilled its responsibility to teach people how to manage their money . "
Chien points out that school textbooks only teach moral lessons like " a penny saved is a penny earned , " which are not exactly what the real world demands these days .
In contrast , many American children understand a bit about money management from early on .
For example , a child in her early teens might babysit for the neighbors or cut lawns , and then put the money in a mutual fund .
Some investment websites have games for children to teach them about various investment instruments and portfolios .
These treat personal money management as a serious life skill that all modern people should know .
Chien says that the situation is just like sex education in the past .
They give it only the most cursory treatment in schools , but most people have a strong desire to find out about it , so as a result they have to pick up what they can from the newspapers or cable TV .
The result of the lack of a proper investment outlook is that speculation is rampant .
According to statistics of the Ministry of Finance , 87.5 % of the trading volume on the Taiwan stock exchange comes from individual investors .
In 1999 turnover was 288 % -LRB- that is , total trading volume was 2.88 times the total value of the market -RRB- , which , though considerably down from nearly 600 % ten years before , remained four times higher than the New York stock exchange .
Despite numerous painful lessons in the past , the habit of chasing a rising market and cutthroat selling in a falling market has proven difficult to change .
A new climate for the e-generation
Fortunately , over the last three years foreign investors have brought some new ideas into the country .
Although they still engage in " hit - and - run " high - volume trading for quick gains , at least most foreign investors ignore gossip and do n't touch the more speculative stocks .
Rather , they put more emphasis on the fundamentals of a given company or industry .
Dennis Chien notes that foreign firms have also introduced risk management ideas like " having a well - rounded portfolio " -LRB- i.e. " do n't put all your eggs in one basket " -RRB- .
These have had a positive impact on the local stock market , and have given the investment activities of the e-generation a more rational foundation than those of their parents .
The chief characteristics of the current wave of e-generation personal money management are great ambition , reliance on expert analysis , and diversification of investment targets .
Nevertheless , the hottest investments are always changing , and perhaps no amount of rational analysis or detailed information will be able to change this .
Chia Chen - i , senior executive vice president of the Individual Banking Sector at Bank Sinopac -LRB- which earlier this year created a stir in the industry by introducing the world 's first five - in - one money management account -RRB- has been observing the evolution of the financial environment in Taiwan for many years , and offers the following thoughts about trends in money management .
Chia recalls that in the 1960s , people were too poor to have any money to manage ; there were also fears of war , and so any money people did have they quickly exchanged for gold or US dollars on the black market .
In the 1970s , faced with two oil crises and inflation , the idea of buying property to preserve value became widespread , and those who could afford it bought land and houses .
At that time , the stock market had only a hundred or so listed companies , and its fate depended on a few manipulators behind the scenes .
It was seen as a " cannibalistic market " which scared off most citizens .
The past is gone
The real fad for personal money management only hit Taiwan in the mid-1980s .
It was then that the country 's accumulated economic resources began to come to the surface .
The huge trade surplus built up over many years caused the NT dollar to appreciate , and attracted a huge amount of speculative foreign money into Taiwan .
The stock market index rose from 600 or so in 1985 to more than 12,000 by 1990 .
Meanwhile , the price of property rose from an average of NT$ 71,800 per ping -LRB- about 3.3 square meters -RRB- in 1986 to NT$ 284,500 per ping in 1989 .
At that time , great opportunities for making money stared one right in the face .
In pursuit of overnight wealth , many people mortgaged their property to buy stocks , and then used their stocks as collateral to borrow more money , creating a vicious cycle that laid the foundation for the burst bubble and huge debts of later years .
But , having reviewed the past , Chia Chen - i declares : " In money management , you can only look to the future ; there 's no point in regretting what 's gone . "
Indeed , in the era of the Internet , with everything moving much faster , investment indicators like product popularity and employment trends can change overnight .
Those who can not see the trends or who can not react fast enough are doomed to be the losers in the wealth game .
Take for example the case of Mrs. Chang .
Widowed at an early age , for over 20 years she supported her family as an independent real estate broker .
Her success made her very confident about her understanding of the property market .
Six years ago , she decided to help the family of her younger brother , who contracted a terminal illness , to buy a new house .
At the time , the price of high - rise apartments in the Tanshui New Town had fallen from NT$ 220,000 per ping to NT$ 150,000 .
Congratulating herself on getting a low price , and confident that the market would rebound , Mrs. Chang happily put down the first payment and watched her brother 's family move in .
However , it was about this time that many new projects - started earlier by construction firms hoping to take advantage of peak prices - came on the market .
The number of empty units rose to over one million .
Next , increased cross-strait tensions put a further damper on the property market .
The September 21 earthquake last year was the final straw .
Today you can find high - rise apartments in Tanshui New Town for as little as NT$ 110,000 per ping .
Mrs. Chang 's brother 's family is stuck with a heavy mortgage , and there are constant recriminations between Mrs. Chang and her nieces and nephews.
Will the Taiwan property market inevitably recover ?
Not necessarily .
Looking around the world , at the US , Japan , Hong Kong , and even mainland China , there are countless examples of long - term downturns in the housing market .
The popular book Die Broke notes that the sharp rise in housing prices in the US in the 1960s and 1970s was due to underlying structural factors :
The large generation of " baby boomers " were starting careers and families , thereby increasing demand for housing .
At that time , some of the older generation about to retire happily sold their houses to the younger at high prices .
The large profits they earned attracted numerous speculators into the market , and prices were driven even higher , encouraging construction of ever more homes .
But now that most of the baby boomers have their own homes , and the current " e-generation " is smaller , who are all those extra homes going to be sold to ?
Snafu
The upshot of all this is , as Hsu Yen - shan , chairman of the Department of Finance at National Chengchi University , cautions : " There are no absolute experts at money management . "
So - called experts are simply those who have particular knowledge about a certain sector in a certain place at a certain time .
But you know the old saying : " People have two feet , but money has four . "
Trends change faster than most people can anticipate .
No wonder the " stock masters " featured on cable TV usually disappear from view after a brief reign , only to be replaced by equally short - lived successors .
In the past two years , perhaps brainwashed by money management dogma that says " the early bird gets the worm , " investors have swarmed like bees for the latest fads , sometimes jumping in even before the true value is known .
The US NASDAQ index , which has a history of 29 years behind it , suddenly surged from 2800 in October of last year to more than 5000 by March of this year .
Telecommunications , Internet , and biotechnology stocks soared .
The price - to - earnings ratio of some individual stocks reached 500 , which some ridiculed as the " price - to - dream ratio . "
" Investors sometimes act as if they do n't care about a company 's current losses , but simply put all their faith in the distant future .
Unfortunately , the farther in the future something is , the more likely it is that expectations will be wrong , " points out Chiu Shean - bii , a professor of finance at National Taiwan University .
Beginning in mid-March of this year , NASDAQ high - tech stocks plummeted .
For many investors , earnings accumulated over many years disappeared in a matter of weeks .
The misguided idea that " what is new is better " also has been a problem in Taiwan .
A certain " Mr. Wang , " who works in the government , last year thought he would jump on the bandwagon for telecom and Internet stocks .
He borrowed money to purchase 80 blocks of shares , at NT$ 13 per share , of fixed - line Internet network stocks , which had n't yet even been listed .
When the price fell to NT$ 11 per share , he still did n't worry , thinking that " so long as I do n't sell , the loss wo n't be realized . "
Little did he expect that the new government would clamp down on illegal trading in fixed - line network stocks .
Suddenly his whole investment - well over NT$ 1 million - has been frozen , and all he can do is stand on the sidelines in a state of panic .
To be sure , ignorance of new trends is not recommended , but looking too far into the future can also lead to disappointment .
Indeed , in this information era , money management may even be getting more difficult .
Strange to say , but the explosion of money management information , which should in theory make investors ' lives easier , does not .
As Chiu Shean - bii says : " There 's plenty of information out there , and there are so - called experts everywhere .
But the result is that investors do n't know what to believe , and find it even more difficult to make a decision . "
Moreover , often even the best information and analysis is no match for sheer luck .
Cabula Chang , editor - in - chief of the money management website SmartNet , describes a case in point .
Last year , one of the hottest stocks was Quanta Computers , which reached 800 per share .
The story goes that there was an old grandmother who followed the crowd in and out of the stock , earning a huge amount in the process .
Afterwards , she asked : " What I still do n't understand is , how can selling pork jerky be so profitable ? "
It turns out that she thought she was investing in a dried - pork company of the same name , and those who heard her question nearly fainted with disbelief .
Money management madness
The fever for money management has in fact disrupted the lives of many people , and brought a lot of headaches .
However , Jessica Liu , associate director of the Taipei branch of UBS , who has written a number of books on money management , says that there is no turning back .
Whenever some people get ahead , others will follow , and no amount of calls for simpler lifestyles or new value systems can stop them .
The reason is very simple .
" The money management fever is a natural product of changing times . "
According to Liu , individualism and the rise of urban commercial society have broken down the support networks of traditional agricultural society .
In addition , since the 1980s Taiwan has been swept up in the globalization of capitalism .
Rural society has disintegrated , and traditional industrial sectors have withered , as newly rising electronics and information industries have appeared one after another .
These rapid changes have brought the threat of unemployment or early retirement to many individuals .
In order to cope with the increasing uncertainty of life , it is necessary for people to build up a nest egg .
Liu says : " If you have NT$ 30 million in the bank , you do n't care whether you have to retire or not .
What 's important is that you do n't have to worry about the future , and live in fear that a sudden loss of your salary could ruin your life . " Of course , everyone feels a different sense of urgency about the uncertainties of life .
Sometimes , in fact , this can become a source of interpersonal friction .
" Miss Chen " of Pingtung worries that her father , soon to retire at age 60 , does n't think much about money , and his expected retirement plus savings will be less than NT$ 4 million -LRB- about US$ 120,000 -RRB- .
You manage , I benefit ?
As Miss Chen does not hesitate to say : " My Mom and Dad still think that it would only mean an extra set of chopsticks on the table for them to live with their daughter .
It seems they have n't realized yet that they may live to be 85 .
They have n't made any preparations for living expenses , vacations , or the enormous medical expenses that can be expected over the next 25 years . "
She has encouraged her parents to put part of their savings into a mutual fund or the like , but without success .
Indeed , the issue has become a sore point between her and her mother .
Meanwhile , the changes in the larger environment that are making people anxious about their economic security are boons to companies trying to market financial products .
A certain American bank has recently been doing " carpet bombing " advertising with slogans like " One out of every two people wants to retire ten years early , but has n't yet begun a financial plan ! " or " 60 % of parents want to send their children abroad to study , but one - third of these do n't know how much money they should prepare ! "
It is said that these ads have been very effective .
Chen Yi - fen , vice president of the Individual Banking Department at Fubon Bank , speaking as someone who has been closely following this problem from the sidelines , reminds consumers that no matter what the source - advertising , websites , or whatever - though advice may be cloaked in a halo of expertise , the motive is to sell products and to earn money from the financial activities of clients .
Chen says : " It 's like those ads for milk that emphasize how fearful osteoporosis is .
The problem is , they do n't tell you that milk is by no means the only way to prevent this , or even the most effective . "
It ai n't over till it 's over
Another factor driving " investment anxiety " is peer pressure . "
If a 40 - year - old does not have a securities account , he wo n't be able to engage in conversations with his peers about the market , so naturally he will feel out of touch , " says Cabula Chang .
Chang admits that he still lives in a rented house in Tanshui .
His wife wonders why his colleagues in the financial management community are multi-millionaires , while he still has not had his rendezvous with fortune .
Chang tells his wife that one should not compare oneself to others .
Their success may be temporary or even illusory .
A number of his friends who had insider information were quite proud of themselves when they profited from the rise of Taiwan Pineapple to more than 200 .
But within less than two years , the stock collapsed and became worthless paper .
Chang recalls an inexperienced reporter who got sucked in to the market two years ago by some irresistible insider information .
He even mortgaged his house and persuaded his friends to invest with him .
Today , he still has not got his head above water .
Chang says , " The longer I 'm in this business , the more I feel that you ca n't get anywhere by trying to get ahead quickly . "
Investment options are like churning whirlpools ; of course you enjoy the ride as long as you are on top of the water , but currents shift , and eventually you may get sucked down .
" In investing , until the final moment , you never know whether you 've won or lost . "
Jessica Liu , who personally feels little anxiety about money management , points out that one of her core principles for investing is to not compare herself with others .
" This is because I know that opportunities to make money come and go .
If I do n't make a lot this wave , there 'll be another wave later . "
She says that anxiety rises in direct proportion to a person 's expectations and desires .
The more you want , the more anxiety you feel , and the greater will be the sense of disappointment if you fail .
In other words , anxiety derives from greed .
" If you buy TSMC at 150 hoping it will go up to 220 within a couple of months because that 's what you need to make your final house payment , then it only goes up to 200 , you 'll feel dissatisfied , " says Liu .
This sense of disappointment is completely due to the lack of a proper money management outlook .
People in middle age invest in hopes of finding a sense of personal security .
But members of the e-generation often have more specific objectives in mind .
Lin Yu - ting , currently a sophomore in the Department of Financial Management at National Chengchi University , puts the money she makes working part - time into the market .
She says that she has " a specific plan for each period of time , such as going abroad , or buying a car . "
So her aim is " to manage my money so that I can spend it ! "
Lin 's classmate Ou Chien - ming says that he has always wanted to save money to go traveling with his girlfriend .
Last year , after vacillating for quite a while , he finally borrowed NT$ 80,000 from his mother to invest in stocks , under the assumption that , by putting to use what he was learning in school , it would n't be that hard to make a good return .
Alas , he put his faith in the predictions of a certain investment adviser , and put everything he had into securities stocks , which stagnated .
After the election of Chen Shui - bian as president , he mistakenly assumed that the market would go down , and sold everything without even looking at the share prices .
He ended up selling at the low point , and his dream of going abroad is even farther out of reach than it was before .
Healthy money management
Chiu Shean - bii of National Taiwan University was told in a recent meeting with the general manager of certain large American commercial bank : " Asians always ask : ' Is the market going to go up or down tomorrow ? '
But investment advisors are not weather forecasters , and we do n't pretend that we can know the future . "
This banker says that his money management target is not to make a specific profit within a specific time , but to use a variety of financial instruments - including defensive investments like insurance and reliable ones like savings , as well as an active investment portfolio - to appropriately diversify his assets .
He seeks to " build a Noah 's ark .
When the weather is good , you can make a little more progress , but when storms hit , you can ride them out . "
Chen Yi - fen , who comes across all manner of money management plans every day , often wonders about the meaning of it all .
She says that today banks are always talking about how they want to provide every individual with tools to " intelligently manage money . "
For example , they provide credit cards that award bonus points , housing loans with built - in short - term overdrafts for investment , and even mutual fund accounts that will automatically invest a specific amount at fixed times .
But how much money is enough ?
That depends on the values of the individual .
" Each individual should choose a lifestyle and belief system that they feel comfortable with , and not just follow the crowd , " says Chen .
After all , in a pluralized society , there should be more than one definition of success .
Recently there was a news story about the old author Chang Tuo - wu having to sell lottery tickets on the street .
One financial expert took Chang as an object lesson to " warn " people to learn how to manage their money .
Yet , looking at this another way , if Chang had spent his youth worrying about accumulating money , he would not have had the experiences he did and made his way from being an ordinary soldier to writing such moving works .
In the end , there are no numbers that can validly measure what has been gained in life , and what lost .
It is said that the two biggest causes of family arguments this year have been differences over who to vote for in the presidential election , and over what stocks to buy .
As Jessica Liu reminds us , money management , like life itself , is an accumulation of small experiences , a long road with ups and downs , and so should be faced with equanimity .
After all , is n't the point of making money to have a better life ?
But if you lose your sense of fun , your health , or your friends and family in the process , and if you win the money game only at the cost of losing the game of life , what kind of a return on your investment is that ?
Grand Justices Rule on Constitutionality of Nuclear Plant Suspension
-LRB- Teng Sue - feng / tr. by David Mayer -RRB-
The Council of Grand Justices last month delivered a constitutional interpretation on the Cabinet 's decision to suspend construction of the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant .
According to the Grand Justices , the Cabinet committed " procedural errors " in arriving at its decision .
The ruling did not specify , however , whether construction of the nuclear power plant is to be resumed .
After the decision was released , the ruling and opposition camps came out with conflicting interpretations .
The legislature 's opposition coalition agreed to hold an extraordinary session so that Premier Chang Chun - hsiung could present a report on the policy decision to the legislature .
It is anyone 's guess , however , as to when the controversy will finally reach a conclusion .
After deliberating for weeks on the constitutionality of the Cabinet 's decision to suspend construction of the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant , the 15 members of the Grand Council of Justices delivered a constitutional interpretation on January 15 .
In announcing the ruling , Judicial Yuan Secretary - General Yang Jen - shou explained that the Executive Yuan 's decision to suspend construction of the nuclear plant was a major change in government policy , and since the premier is required to deliver a report to the legislature in such cases , Premier Chang 's failure to do so represents a procedural flaw .
The ruling requires the premier to go to the legislature as soon as possible and give the report that he should have delivered there last year .
The Legislative Yuan , for its part , is required to receive the Executive Yuan 's report .
After examining the report , the Legislative Yuan must vote .
If a majority opposes the Executive Yuan 's decision , there are three ways under the ROC Constitution to resolve the standoff :
-LRB- 1 -RRB- the premier can resign ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the legislature can put forward a no - confidence motion against the premier -LRB- which , depending on the outcome , forces either the premier 's resignation or dissolution of the legislature -RRB- ; or -LRB- 3 -RRB- the legislature can pass legislation related to the power plant 's construction .
This turned out to be the most divisive case the Council has ever heard .
Only six justices supported the ruling .
Justice Liu Tieh - cheng wrote a dissenting opinion in which he noted that appropriations are listed in the ROC Constitution together with legislative bills and treaty ratification bills , and argued that they should be treated the same way .
Once such legislation has been promulgated into law by the president , wrote Liu , it must be implemented unless it is vetoed by the Cabinet .
Justice Vincent Sze authored a partial dissenting opinion arguing that since it is the duty of the Council of Grand Justices to rule on constitutional issues , the Council ought to state clearly whether or not the constitution had been violated .
Justice Tung Hsiang - fei pointed that legislation barring construction of the nuclear power plant had already been passed twice before by the legislature , and was successfully vetoed each time by the previous Kuomintang administration .
Noting that the project got underway several years ago , Tung argued that the Cabinet clearly violated the constitution when it unilaterally suspended the project on the grounds that a new party had come to power and its party platform was opposed to the nuclear plant .
After the constitutional ruling was released , it met with many different interpretations .
On issues of primary concern to the public -LRB- such as whether Premier Chang would have to resign as a result of the ruling , and whether construction of the nuclear plant will resume -RRB- , there has been conflicting commentary .
Yu Shyi - kun , Secretary - General of the Presidential Office , stated that the president would respect the ruling of the Grand Justices , but said the language of the ruling does not appear to require a Cabinet reshuffle .
The various opposition caucuses in the legislature issued a joint statement arguing that in describing the decision to suspend construction of the plant as " procedurally flawed , " the Grand Justices had in effect declared the Cabinet 's unilateral action illegal , and the Cabinet 's action has naturally lost legal validity for that reason .
This is not the first time a constitutional interpretation has been used to resolve a political dispute .
What exact role has the constitutional interpretation played in the dispute over the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant ?
According to National Chengchi University law professor and constitutional expert Su Yeong - chin , who headed the legal team presenting the Legislative Yuan 's arguments to the Council of Grand Justices in this case , the crux of the nuclear plant dispute is about the use of democratic means in arriving at policy decisions , and should not be seen as an argument for or against nuclear power .
The role of the judiciary in this case , says Su , was to determine whether the premier has the authority to suspend implementation of a budget appropriation .
In industrialized nations , changes in policy on nuclear power are a common occurrence , but there is no country where the executive branch makes unilateral decisions behind closed doors .
Heading the legal team presenting the Cabinet 's arguments to the Grand Justices was Hsu Tsung - li .
Hsu notes that while the ruling pointed to procedural flaws in the Cabinet 's action , the ruling said nothing about any violation of the constitution or the law .
The Grand Justices , argues Hsu , felt that the dispute could be resolved by having the premier present a report to the legislature , or through consultations between the legislature and the cabinet .
However , said Hsu , since the government has not necessarily built up a consensus in support of its stance against nuclear power , another option might be to have the premier resign , disband the legislature , and elect a new legislature so that the public can express its will regarding the issue .
If other constitutional rulings in the past two years are any guide , it appears that the dispute between the ruling and opposition camps will have to be resolved in the political arena .
Last March the Grand Justices rendered a constitutional interpretation when the ruling and opposition parties were wrangling over a proposed term extension for all members of the National Assembly .
The justices ruled that the decision making process violated the National Assembly 's rules of order and went against the principle that all decisions must be open and transparent .
After the term extension was declared invalid , retaliatory constitutional amendments were proposed in the National Assembly to abolish the Council of Grand Justices and strip the justices of their lifetime stipends .
In 1996 , the Grand Justices ruled on the constitutionality of the plan to have then - Vice President Lien Chan serve concurrently as premier .
The justices issued an ambiguous ruling stating that while the plan was not unconstitutional , neither was it was appropriate .
After the ruling was announced , the ruling and opposition camps both declared victory and eventually negotiated an agreement on the question of whether Lien Chan would be allowed to serve as premier .
The ruling and opposition camps have now agreed that Premier Chang should present a report to the legislature , but the question of whether to resume construction of the power plant remains a focus of contention .
p. 65
Plans for the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant have triggered an intense struggle between opponents of nuclear power and those more concerned about industrial development .
A constitutional ruling by the Council of Grand Justices appears to have moved the debate back to square one , with the ruling and opposition parties slugging it out once again .

Scentsory Perceptions : What 's the Deal With Aromatherapy ?
-LRB- Eric Lin / photos by Hsueh Chi - kuang / tr. by Phil Newell -RRB-
The current fitness trend in Taiwan combines working out with recreation and the traditional Chinese idea of " health cultivation . "
Of particular interest has been aromatherapy , with its new - age underpinning of the integration of " body , mind , and spirit . "
What exactly is aromatherapy ?
What can it do for you ?
Aromatherapy involves the use of " essential oils " extracted from the flowers , leaves , branches , bark , rind , or roots of medicinal plants .
These oils are then mixed with a " carrier " -LRB- usually a vegetable oil -RRB- or are diluted .
There are a number of different applications , including oil massages , fragrant baths , and heating of oils over a flame to diffuse the aroma .
Tang Ya - chun , president of Alexander Health Clubs , says , " In fact you could consider aromatherapy the latest trend in personal care .
To combine this with working out is to combine a beauty perspective with a health one , with more of a recreational feel . "
There 's nothing new about aroma - therapy .
People in ancient Rome often rubbed their bodies with oil in the public baths as a means of relieving stress , and the Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing [ Classic of Roots and Herbs Discovered by Shen Nong ] , the oldest Chinese medical treatise , also describes treatments which are functionally the same as aromatherapy .
So why the sudden surge of interest ?
Perhaps there is a greater need among modern people - plagued by stress , insomnia , anxiety , and inability to concentrate - to find a way to chill out .
Tang Ya - chun states that most health clubs in Taiwan combine aromatherapy with hydrotherapy , and include these treatments under their " spa " services .
As Tang explains : " In the spa , particular attention is devoted to the pleasuring and relaxation of the senses of smell , hearing , touch , taste , and vision .
Besides mellow music , soft lighting , and diffusion of fragrant oils , there is also a ' Vichy bath , ' which allows the skin to breathe more freely .
With an aromatherapy massage , essential oils sink in , and the skin regains its flexibility . "
In order that members can really let their hair down , most " spa " facilities are only open to women .
Because there have to be specialists on duty , the cost is quite high , so in most health clubs aromatherapy is available only at an additional charge .
Different fragrances have , it is said , different effects : Lavender helps with problems like tension and exhaustion .
Sandalwood promotes relaxation and tranquility .
Bergamot helps settle the mind .
Rose is advised for inflammation and swelling , and it also invigorates the skin .
Chamomile relieves tension and is used for treating menstrual cramps and insomnia .
Different oils can be combined depending on different needs .
Does aromatherapy really work ?
Ho Tsung - hsien , a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine , says that Chinese medicine has long included some aromatherapy - like treatments , and theoretically it is possible for the medicinal effects of oils to be transmitted to the body through the meridians using tuina -LRB- traditional Chinese massage therapy -RRB- .
" Things used in aroma - therapy like lavender and sandalwood definitely help people relax and sleep better , and can relieve tension and headaches , " says Dr. Ho .
" But , " he cautions , " the user has to put him - or herself in the proper frame of mind to relax , or else the effect will be largely cancelled out . "
He adds , moreover , that he remains skeptical of claims of wider curative powers for aromatherapy .
A Miss Wu , who sometimes goes to spas , testifies that aromatherapy definitely helps her mellow out .
" But at one or two thousand NT dollars per time , it 's too expensive to go to the health club more than once in a while .
I more often buy aromatic oils and use them at home - just take a fragrant bath or heat the oil to diffuse the fragrance .
That 's much more affordable . "
It is undeniable that both Tang Ya - chun and Miss Wu , who both use aromatherapy from time to time , look vibrant and healthy .
Is this the result of " essential oils , " or is it just that people who would use aromatherapy are the same people who take good care of their health in general ?
Anyway , there 's no harm in giving it a try yourself , and you may find your own answer .

A few drops of essential oils , a charming wooden barrel , and a comfy chair - what more could you ask ?
Health club VIP rooms offer fragrant relaxation .

Essential oils come in enticing packages ; different aromatherapy products are advised for different effects .
A Second Spring for Textiles in Taiwan ?
-LRB- Laura Li / photos by Pu Hua - chih / tr. by Robert Taylor -RRB-
Early in December the China Textile In - stitute , located at Tucheng in Taipei County , celebrated its 40th anniversary with a dynamic multimedia show .
The CTI 's 40 - year history has borne witness to the rise and decline of Taiwan 's textile industry .
Forty years ago , Taiwan was just crossing the threshold of industrialization .
The textile industry was the darling of the nation , just like the electronics industry today .
Although it has lost its former kudos , the textile industry is still an indispensable part of Taiwan 's industrial landscape .
For the last decade , the CTI has been working hand in hand with the industry , quietly sowing the seeds of research and development in many places .
Can those seeds germinate to create a second spring for Taiwan 's textile industry ?
As the latest bout of winter weather hits Taiwan , do you want to go up Mt. Hehuan to see the snow ?
You could put on a jacket containing highly insulating melt - spun ceramic fibers .
When the wind sends a fine driving rain slanting across the water , are you still unwilling to forgo the pleasure of sea angling ?
Why not wear some micropore breathable rainwear , with an outer layer which is completely waterproof , but an inner layer which is dry and comfortable on the skin ?
Tencel , made from wood cellulose , has given the lie to the notion that man - made fibers never degrade , and is set to become one of the most important fibers of the coming environmental century ; and the shrimp and crab shells which were once tossed away are now being processed to extract chitin , which when used to treat clothing can inhibit bacteria and mold and prevent unwanted odors , and which can also be used as a dressing for burns which both reduces inflammation and encourages new tissue growth . . . .
What sunset industry ?
Ceramic fibers , stainless steel , shrimp shells - at first glance there seems to be no connection with spinning and weaving .
But in fact these are among the latest products and trends quietly taking shape in the textile industry .
With the rise of new industries such as electronics , aerospace and biotechnology , the areas of application for textile products have expanded ever wider , from being simply coverings for the human body to finding their way up into space and down into the earth .
" There are only sunset products , not sunset industries . "
These words from competitiveness guru Michael Porter hit the nail on the head when it comes to Taiwan 's textile industry 's current efforts to transform itself into a high - tech , capital - and information - intensive sector .
" Twenty years ago , the polyester uniforms worn by schoolchildren in Taiwan turned dreadfully stiff when you tried to wash them ; cotton clothes shrank ; nylon made your skin red and itchy ; stockings would ladder if you so much as looked at them ; and decent clothes had to be expensively dry cleaned , " recalls CTI president Yao Hsing - chuan .
If clothes in Taiwan today are getting ever lighter , softer , warmer , more wrinkle - free and easier to keep clean , and if their colors are bright , fresh and stain - resistant , this is not thanks to the magic wand wielded by Cinderella 's fairy godmother , but is the result of the unceasing efforts towards research , development and upgrading put in by the textile industry over the years .
" Upgrading " has been a word on the lips of everyone in the textile industry in recent years .
But the adverse environment in which the industry has had to operate has made the pace of that upgrading halting and hesitant .
" In the early 1980s , making ready - to - wear garments for export was pretty much a sure - fire money - spinner .
Everything sold like hot cakes , just like electronics today , " says Yao Hsing - chuan .
But around 1987 , under strong US pressure , the NT dollar appreciated , and exporters lost their competitive price advantage .
Next , there was a series of rises in land and labor costs .
Garment making is labor - intensive , and the combination of internal and external pressures led to wholesale factory closures .
Many firms moved production to mainland China or Southeast Asia , and Taiwan 's remaining domestic textile industry was dramatically reshuffled .
With the departure of the ready - to - wear industry , Taiwan lost its " garment kingdom " status .
But looking from another perspective , the Taiwanese manufacturers who spread all over Southeast Asia , mainland China and Latin America were still very much a force to be reckoned with , and in their new locations they continued to source raw materials and semi-finished goods from Taiwan .
With their support , the upstream portions of the industry - fiber making , yarn spinning , weaving , dyeing , finishing and garment design - were able to stay in Taiwan and prosper .
In September 1998 , while the industry was still reeling from the effects of the Asian financial crisis , construction began of the long - planned specialist industrial parks in Yunlin and Changhua Counties .
These were the peak of the large investments made in Taiwan 's textile industry over recent years .
But overcapacity and shrinking demand caused by the crisis had hit the industry hard .
By mid-1999 things were looking up again , but then massive power failures in the wake of the 21 September earthquake wiped out nearly NT$ 10 billion worth of textile orders .
Taiwan 's biggest currency earner
Nevertheless , thanks to its solid foundations built up over 40 years , the textile industry is still a pillar of Taiwan 's economy .
In 1999 , Taiwan 's textile exports are expected to be worth US$ 14.5 billion or 12 % of the island 's total exports , behind only electronics -LRB- 17.6 % -RRB- and IT / telecom products -LRB- 12.3 % -RRB- .
Moreover , after deducting the cost of imported raw materials etc. , the textile industry is Taiwan 's biggest foreign currency earner , bringing in over US$ 10 billion each year .
For instance , polyester is the most widely used man - made fiber , and little Taiwan produces no less than 17 % of the total worldwide supply , making it the largest supplier .
The island 's total production of man - made fibers ranks third globally , behind the USA and mainland China .
At present , the largest category among Taiwan 's textile exports is finished cloth , which accounts for more than 60 % of Taiwan 's textile exports by value .
" The textile industry has deep roots in Taiwan , and there are many processes to be gone through from the fiber to the finished garment .
Thus there are many key technologies which can be developed , and the industry can sustain a large workforce . "
CTI acting vice-president Wu Chung - fu observes that the advanced countries still devote substantial efforts to developing textile technologies , and naturally this is something Taiwan should not lightly give up .
We ca n't give it up , but neither can we rest on our laurels .
With Southeast Asia and mainland China catching up fast , Taiwan 's textile industry will only have a future if it can quickly transform itself and develop towards high - tech products .
The CTI , which a decade ago began a timely change in its role to one of a specialist R&D center working in partnership with firms , has become the leading R&D center for Taiwan 's several thousand textile industry companies .
The development of new " nylon 66 " fibers is a case in point .
Grace Kuo , a vice-president at Ta Ching Hwa Enterprise Co .
-LRB- TCH -RRB- , as yet the only company in Taiwan to manufacture nylon 66 filament , recounts that ten years ago her husband and a group of friends who had worked many years at Formosa Chemicals and Fiber Corporation wanted to set up in business for themselves .
At that time , a huge amount of nylon 66 fiber - 600 tonnes per month - was used by the local textile industry in the manufacture of specialty apparel such as women 's tights , swimwear and underwear .
But Taiwan had no manufacturing capability in the fiber , and relied entirely on imports .
This aroused their interest in entering the field .
David and Goliath
Grace Kuo comments that nylon 66 was a new fiber with good elasticity , high strength and a soft , bulky feel , along with good resistance to ultraviolet light .
Adding just 15 to 20 % of nylon 66 to a fabric transforms it , making it thoroughly suited to modern - day demands for " healthy , comfortable " clothing .
The big international manufacturers had realized this and adopted an oligarchic strategy : as well as making it difficult for others to obtain the raw materials , they were very careful not to reveal any of their manufacturing know - how .
But thanks to the expertise the TCH team had built up over many years in the textile fibers field , within the first year after the company was set up they succeeded in drawing filaments from nylon 66 granules .
" As soon as we did that , Dupont cut their prices , hoping to squeeze us right out of the market , " says Grace Kuo with a smile .
But after going head - to - head with TCH for several years , Dupont realized how resilient the company was , and since then the two firms have begun to cooperate .
Currently , TCH is the world 's fifth - largest manufacturer of nylon 66 filament , supplying 8 % of the global market .
It stands as another example of a Taiwanese company successfully taking on the big boys in international markets .
The original use of nylon 66 was in tights and swimwear , but these are far from being the only applications for such a superior new fiber .
But because the filaments are so thin -LRB- only half the thickness of a human hair -RRB- , they can easily break at the yarn spinning stage , and at the dyeing stage the yarn absorbs only the smallest dye molecules .
Hence firms around the world are still feeling their way forward on how to use this fiber .
For this reason , TCH approached the CTI to conduct a series of cooperative development projects .
To date they have successfully developed various new yarns blended from nylon 66 and other fibers such as acrylic or polyester , and have staged numerous seminars and visited many firms to teach users how to weave and dye the new fabrics and how to design for them .
Why go to such lengths to popularize new fibers ?
Grace Kuo says the textile industry today needs to take a lead from the electronics industry , and constantly strive for innovation : " What consumer today does n't already have a wardrobe full of clothes ?
If you want to persuade her to spend , you have to keep putting out products which look novel at the first glance and feel great at the first touch .
Only then can you create demand and stimulate consumption , " she avers .
Behind the quest for innovation and change , there needs to be a great deal of R&D work , along with a keen nose for the market .
But 95 % of Taiwan 's textile firms are small or medium - sized enterprises .
They do not have the facilities or staff to carry on R&D , and they lack the perspective to take a broad view of worldwide trends .
Hence in the upgrading process , organizations like the CTI will play an increasingly important role .
Flexibility v. perfectionism
However , G - Fun Industrial Corporation general manager Tsai Chiu - hsiung , who worked at the CTI for many years before setting up in business for himself in late 1998 , has had a different experience .
While at the CTI , Tsai headed a project to develop the technology for making breathable waterproof fabrics .
At that time , he says , few manufacturers in Taiwan were both interested in the technology and competent to apply it .
Later , when his team had developed the process , many firms expressed an interest .
But once they had acquired the technology , many lost money or even went out of business - the results were far from ideal .
" At that time I felt very frustrated .
It was clearly a good process , but after buying the technology for a nominal sum , many companies did n't value it , " says Tsai Chiu - hsiung .
On the one hand , the market for breathable waterproof fabrics was not yet mature , and too many companies entering all at once knocked the bottom out of the market ; on the other , manufacturers in Taiwan still lack the concept of dedicating production equipment to one product .
For fear of putting all their eggs in one basket , many firms are in the habit of producing whatever they can get orders for : today it may be waterproof fabric , tomorrow cloth for tarpaulins , and next month purses .
Their product mix is very varied , with frequent switching .
This makes quality control difficult , so that when firms are faced with a technically demanding product , defects may easily arise .
Worse , they are often unable even to identify the cause .
" ' Flexibility ' helps SMEs survive in difficult times , but it is not conducive to the perfectionist attitudes needed when upgrading . "
Tsai Chiu - hsiung , who urges companies to " know when to give things up , " has now been in business for himself for a year , and his is the only firm in Taiwan which specializes in applying breathable waterproof coatings to fabrics .
With more orders than he can handle , he is now preparing to build a new factory at Touliu in Yunlin County .
G - Fun 's micropore breathable coating is a compound containing special water - soluble granules which create tiny pores in the fabric surface .
Sweat can evaporate through these pores without being absorbed by the fabric , improving comfort compared with traditional hydrophilic fabrics which when worn in the rain start sticking to the body after a time .
G - Fun is also co-operating with the CTI to develop waterproof fabrics with both micropore and hydrophilic characteristics .
At present , most of the company 's orders come from Europe and the USA , and are made into upmarket leisurewear such as climbing or golf apparel which sells for as much as NT$ 8,000 per garment .
Like TCH , G - Fun also hopes its products can help Taiwan 's textile industry upgrade .
" The 21st century will be an age of leisure , and Taiwanese sport and leisurewear fabrics have long held first place worldwide .
If they can all be given better breathability and water resistance , this will greatly increase their added value , " says Tsai Chiu - hsiung .
Fabrics treated by G - Fun are currently a third cheaper than the same grades of fabric from Japan , and Tsai hopes he can attract Taiwanese firms to make greater use of them .
A short - term view
Another type of new fabric which is in great demand is wicking fabric , based on fibers with a special cross-section .
The leading volume producer of wicking fibers in Taiwan is Chung Shing Textile Company .
Its president , William Shang , explains that conventional fibers have a round cross-section , but by changing the fibers ' physical properties it is possible to produce them with various cross-sectional profiles such as X or Y shapes , which create capillaries along the fibers .
These not only quickly wick sweat away from the skin , but also regulate body temperature and allow garments to dry quickly after washing .
However , the fibers ' special properties can easily be destroyed in the various processes they go through such as yarn spinning , weaving , dyeing and finishing , so that making finished garments requires a high degree of technical sophistication .
Chung Shing has launched a fabric named Coolplus to compete with Dupont 's equivalent product , Coolmax .
" Developing new fibers is the most important element in upgrading the textile industry , " says Shang .
However , he acknowledges that although many new products are being developed in Taiwan , on closer inspection they are all copies of products first developed elsewhere , and so fall some way short of real innovation .
But whereas it used to take Taiwanese companies several years of trial and error to figure out how to make such products , the gap between them and their European and American competitors is growing ever smaller .
When new products appear overseas it now only takes Taiwan two to three years to bring out an equivalent .
William Shang observes that when most Taiwanese firms see something new at an overseas exhibition they will bring back a sample , inspect it under a high - powered microscope to determine the weaving method and have it chemically analyzed to find out the composition of the fibers and finishing chemicals .
With Taiwan 's long years of manufacturing experience , it is then not difficult to reproduce the product with 70 - 80 % accuracy .
However , Shang does not see this as a viable long - term strategy .
" The best strategy for the long - term is still to put more effort into basic scientific research , " he says .
For example , he read in Time magazine that because spiders produce the best natural fibers in the world , being both lustrous and resilient , US scientists transferred spider genes into silkworms to produce " super silkworms . "
The technique succeeded , but because the Americans were not very interested in producing clothing textiles , they did not commercialize it .
When it comes to this kind of combination of lateral thinking and advanced technology , Taiwan still has some way to go .
Shang , currently chairman of the CTI 's technology committee , is well aware of where the obstacle to R&D lies : " Innovative ideas take time to mature , and you have to accept a high degree of uncertainty .
But our environment does not allow this . "
He notes that industries in Taiwan always pursue short - term profits , so there is never much interest in technologies which are too forward - looking and can not immediately produce saleable products .
As one of 18 industrial institutes under the Ministry of Economic Affairs , the CTI has some state funding .
But with ever greater budgetary constraints and pressure to cover its own costs , development projects mostly concentrate on firms ' current needs , and stress the sales and profit they generate .
Under such circumstances , epoch - making innovations are unlikely to emerge .
Standardizing colors
Because innovation is so hard to achieve , the highly innovative Sinocolor Book color reference system , which was launched at the CTI 's 40th anniversary celebration , has been greeted with great admiration by many .
The system 's inventor , Hsu Yun - peng , only had a junior high school education , but had researched color matching for 18 years in a dyeing factory .
Discovering that imported color matching software was of little practical use , Hsu , who did n't know a word of English , taught himself to program and wrote an improved version of the software .
Writing color matching software earned Hsu Yun - peng a lot of money , but this was not his main purpose .
His real aim was to produce a color reference system that was genuinely easy to use , to overcome the lack of color standardization which had long plagued the dyeing industry .
To pursue this goal he quit his job , moved to the suburbs of Kuishan in Taoyuan County , and began to spend 18 hours a day studying the problem .
Quite apart from the difficulties of keeping his family fed , he often was n't even sure how old his three children were and what year of school they were in .
Finally he used a three - dimensional model to create a regularly graded , finely differentiated color reference system covering 20,000 colors , each with clear " color coordinates . "
These features are unmatched by any of the systems currently in common use worldwide , which only define up to 3,000 colors .
The textile industry 's efforts to upgrade are gradually showing some results , but looking at the situation overall , CTI president Yao Hsing - chuan is still somewhat worried .
He comments that the majority of companies still have the traditional mindset of pursuing low - cost , high - volume production .
Taiwan is the world 's third biggest producer of man - made fibers , but it only produces a small range of mass - market fibers for apparel fabrics , to the almost total neglect of the hundred or so other high - added - value , special fibers on the market such as high - strength fibers for bullet - proof fabrics , elastic fibers or superalloy aerospace fibers .
Again , when it comes Taiwan 's biggest export item , finished fabrics , these too are largely limited to apparel fabrics , with few companies getting involved in other areas despite their potential .
For instance , Taiwan has been struck by many landslides in recent years , and requires large quantities of geotextiles - heavy - grade textiles laid under or around civil engineering structures to prevent erosion by groundwater movement .
The currently planned high - speed rail system alone is expected to require several million yards of geotextiles .
But Taiwanese companies are inexperienced in this area , and sending products overseas for quality certification tests is time consuming and complicated , so local companies can only stand and watch as the entire market goes to imported products .
Bullet - proof fabrics ?
Geotextiles ?
Are these part of the textile industry ?
Indeed they are .
Yao Hsing - chuan says that textile industry products have three main fields of application : apparel , furnishings and industrial .
At present , over 95 % by value of ROC textile industry output is accounted for by apparel products with low added value .
By contrast , in the USA textiles for clothing and industrial applications are produced in equal quantities , and industrial textiles include a wide variety of different products , many of which are technically demanding and command profit margins with which most apparel products can not compare .
Hence the CTI has already made it one of its major goals to encourage firms to shift their orientation towards industrial textiles .
The development of stainless - steel fibers is one success story in this area .
From false teeth to space suits
Dotted among the paddy fields of Taichung County 's Houli Rural Township are many metal - clad buildings which house a variety of factories producing such products as plastics , furniture and electronic components .
Among them is King 's Metal Fiber Technologies Company , the only firm in Taiwan which draws fibers from stainless steel .
King 's president Rocky Chang is known to all as Dr. Chang , and is indeed still a practicing dentist .
A decade or so ago , while he was studying in Australia , he developed an interest in metallurgy , and hoped to develop the use of metals in tooth implants .
Later he learned that stainless steels have an enormously wide range of applications in the textiles , industrial and military fields .
But he could not find a partner to work with in Australia , so he returned to Taiwan and began collaborating with the CTI .
Today , not only is King 's on a par with the large overseas manufacturers in terms of filament drawing technology , but to assist local downstream manufacturers in using its products , it has also set up metal fiber yarn spinning and fabric weaving plants , and is making efforts in the area of nonwoven fabrics .
Stroking the silver - gray ringlets which are twice as fine as human hair , Chang says that these soft , flexible fibers of high - grade steel can not only make fashion fabrics glisten with a mysterious modern sheen suitable for a millennium party , but - thanks to metals ' outstanding capacity to shield and conduct electromagnetic waves , and their ability to withstand high temperatures and acid or caustic environments - they also have a wide range of applications in many industries .
For instance , at a recent international furniture show in Taipei , King 's exhibited sound insulating panels containing metal fibers , which hi - fi buffs can install to produce an excellent sound studio effect .
Cellphone cases of metal fabric can shield users from the electromagnetic radiation the phones produce ; and in the clean rooms of silicon wafer fabs , where dust particles attracted by static electricity on clothing are the biggest bugbear , there is a host of applications for anti-static fabrics , from workers ' clothing and footwear to trolleys , conveyor belts and wall coverings .
Rocky Chang says that before King 's started producing metal fibers , the market was divided up between a few foreign companies which charged high prices and produced only small quantities of products .
Furthermore , when Taiwanese users had difficulties with production they did not know who to turn to for help .
Looking into the future , Chang hopes that as a key material , stainless steel fiber can have a " locomotive " effect , encouraging various industries in Taiwan to develop a range of different products .
Time to get weaving
Developing industrial textiles requires an understanding of different industries ' needs , and also requires new channels of distribution .
For instance , cellphone cases have to be sold through electronic goods shops , while car airbags have to be sold into automotive distribution channels .
For entrepreneurs who have previously only sold into the clothing trade , this is a challenge .
How to promote " cross-industry cooperation , " and get people in the textile industry to look beyond their own industry 's boundaries and become effective partners for the electronics , construction , medical supplies and other industries is the next task for the CTI to tackle .
As CTI president Yao Hsing - chuan observes , what has enabled Taiwan 's textile industry to survive through the ups and downs of its history is the highly motivated attitude of its entrepreneurs .
It is this ambition which is the best guarantee of the industry creating a second spring .

Lee Kuan Yew Visits Taiwan
Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore came to Taiwan on September 23 , and though he did not publicly comment on the purpose of his visit , observers everywhere speculated that he may have come as an intermediary between Taipei and Beijing .
Indeed , Lee , who has been dubbed " the Asian Godfather , " played a key role in the early 1990s in bringing about the first round of talks between Taiwan 's Koo Chen - fu and Beijing 's Wang Daohan .
It remains to be seen whether Lee 's visit will bring any change in sensitive cross-strait relations , but President Chen Shui - bian revealed after Lee 's departure that he and his guest had reached three points of consensus , including the need for a Singapore - Taiwan free - trade zone .
Lee 's four - day series of closed - door meetings in Taiwan came to an end on September 26 .
He met twice with President Chen Shui - bian and had numerous contacts with a wide range of other leading members of Taiwan society , including Tang Fei -LRB- premier -RRB- , Tsai Ing - wen -LRB- Mainland Affairs Council [ MAC ] chairwoman -RRB- , the three MAC vice chairmen , Shi Huei - yow -LRB- Straits Exchange Foundation [ SEF ] vice chairman -RRB- , Chuang Ming - yao -LRB- National Security Council [ NSC ] secretary - general , Chiou I - jen -LRB- SEF deputy secretary - general -RRB- , Lee Yuan - tseh -LRB- chairman of the Presidential Office 's inter-party task force for policy coordination -RRB- , and Nita Ing -LRB- chairwoman of Taiwan High - Speed Rail Corporation -RRB- .
Lee also held in - depth discussions with Kuomintang -LRB- KMT -RRB- chairman Lien Chan and People First Party -LRB- PFP -RRB- chairman James Soong .
Although no one is saying so , it seems clear that Lee 's visit focused primarily on cross-strait relations .
As one of the most senior politicians in the Asian region , and a man who has had close ties with several generations of leaders on both sides of the Taiwan Strait , Lee Kuan Yew maintains a special status in both Taiwan and mainland China .
The news media have even taken to calling him a cross-strait mediator .
Lee said that the purpose of his whirlwind visit was only to get a first - hand feel for the new administration .
" I was never a cross-strait mediator , " he stated categorically , " and I 've never said that I was . "
MAC Vice Chairman Chen Ming - tung sounded a similar note during interpellations at the legislature .
When asked whether Lee Kuan Yew had come as Beijing 's emissary , Chen said , " I can guarantee that he has not . "
Tsai Ing - wen , who met twice with Lee during his brief stay , added that Lee has considerable political stature in Asia and around the world , and his concern about cross-strait relations and the direction of policy in this regard is helpful to Taiwan .
Beijing has also commented favorably on Lee 's visit .
PRC Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi stated that while the Taiwan issue is China 's internal matter , it welcomes efforts by anyone who upholds the " one China " principle to bring about an early resolution .
It would thus appear that Lee 's visit was welcomed by leaders on both sides of the Taiwan Strait , but in fact the two sides did not actually share a common view on the matter .
Taiwan 's top concern was peace and stability , while mainland China continually brought up the theme of unification .
Although Lee 's trip would seem to have been a shot in the arm for the deadlocked cross-strait relationship , it also generated a lot of speculation and ill will because neither Lee nor anyone who met with him was willing to say a word about the content of their discussions , and ROC officials who went to call on Lee at his hotel skulked around in underground walkways and service elevators to avoid journalists .
Lee 's stay in Taiwan certainly left the ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs -LRB- MOFA -RRB- with a bad taste in its mouth , for the MOFA was not involved in the visit in any way , and was n't even aware in advance that it was in the works .
That seemed quite odd , considering that Lee is the founding father of Singapore and is still active as Senior Minister .
Many commentators blasted the way the visit was handled , and legislators described the affair as a serious breach of protocol .
Foreign Minister Tien Hung - mao was quoted as saying , " I feel a bit kicked around . "
President Chen broke the silence after Lee left , stating at a function in honor of model public servants that he and Lee Kuan Yew had reached three agreements , namely that Singapore and Taiwan should : -LRB- 1 -RRB- sign a " Singapore - Taiwan Free Trade Zone Agreement " ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- lend impetus to financial cooperation , especially a possible exchange rate agreement ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- effect telecommunication and Internet alliances .
President Chen further stated that after Taiwan joins the World Trade Organization -LRB- WTO -RRB- , Taiwan and Singapore , as fellow members of that select group of economic overachievers that journalists have come to dub " the Four Tigers , " should stop viewing each other as competitors and move toward a friendly division of labor .
President Chen also stressed : " Senior Minister Lee is not a mediator .
He is not pushing any particular viewpoint , and he is no one 's mouthpiece . "
Cross-strait relations , said Chen , were just one of many issues that he discussed with Lee .
It may be that the pursuit of economic and trade relations is the only way to get Taiwan and mainland China onto the path toward a resolution of the cross-strait stalemate .
Separate entry into the WTO by Taiwan and mainland China may be the best opportunity for the two sides to settle upon a " no unification , no independence " modus vivendi .
It seems apparent that mainland China is the only place where Taiwan 's traditional industries can survive .
Even high - tech industries are slowly making their way to the PRC .
Uncertainty in cross-strait relations will inevitably hurt Taiwan 's economy .
Lee Kuan Yew describes the debate between " one China " versus " one China as a point for discussion " and other such issues as mere semantics , and says that only history can bring the cross-strait issue to a resolution .
In the second half of his memoirs , which were published in Taiwan in September , Lee writes : " Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait can reduce friction by building a relationship that is a bit more acceptable to both sides . "
We ought to use Lee 's visit as an opportunity to take stock of our current situation and further clarify our policy vis - a - vis mainland China , thereby bringing about an improvement in cross-strait relations .
Therein lies the most concrete significance of Lee 's trip .
New President Takes Office on May 20
-LRB- Eric Lin / tr. by David Mayer -RRB-
The Republic of China 's tenth - term president and vice president , Chen Shui - bian and Annette Lu , took the oath of office on 20 May , 2000 in the first - ever transfer of power in Chinese history to a popularly elected leader from the opposition .
In his inaugural speech , Chen touched on a wide range of issues of concern to voters in Taiwan .
On the domestic front , he discussed the alternation of political parties in power , democratic reforms , a fair and just society , a government for all the people , nonpartisan government by a coalition of forces opposed to corruption , the establishment of an efficient and dynamic government , a knowledge - based economy , law and order , environmental preservation , education , culture , reconstruction from last year 's September 21st earthquake , and various other issues .
The common thread running through his domestic policy remarks was an emphasis on reform .
On the sensitive topic of cross-strait relations , he sent a number of positive signals to Beijing .
The speech put a heavy stress on democracy and human rights , a reflection of the high expectations the public holds for the government on these fronts .
Later in the day , post-inaugural celebrations kicked off around the island and commentary on Chen Shui - bian 's address came pouring in from across the political spectrum .
What was the overseas reaction ?
What did domestic commentators have to say ?
How will Chen 's presidency change Taiwan ?
The new president 's inaugural ceremony began at 9:00 am on 20 May at the Presidential Palace .
Chen Shui - bian and Annette Lu were sworn in by Weng Yueh - sheng , president of the Judicial Yuan , then Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin - pyng presented Chen with the official seal of the Republic of China and three other presidential seals .
Chen took his first act as president by signing his name to the appointments of Tang Fei as premier , Chang Chun - hsiung as secretary - general of the Office of the President , and Chuang Ming - yao as secretary - general of the National Security Council .
After Tang took his oath , he submitted his Cabinet nominations to Chen for formal appointment .
The most remarkable moment of the inauguration came at 11:00 am when Chen strolled into the open air to take the oath of office and deliver his inaugural address to the nation in front of the Presidential Palace .
Featuring aboriginal folk songs and a rendition of the ROC national anthem by pop queen Chang Hui - mei , the ceremony was attended by over 10,000 foreign guests , overseas Chinese , and local citizens .
After the national anthem , Chen Shui - bian delivered his much anticipated inaugural address .
Observers at home and around the world were waiting and wondering - would he address the " one China " issue ?
In his 40 - minute speech , Chen declared the determination of the people of Taiwan to carry out a peaceful transfer of power between political parties , and to continue forward with their democratic political system .
He called for a government for all the people and a non-partisan coalition of the forces opposed to corruption , and declared the new government 's determination to improve law and order , the economy , the environment , post-earthquake reconstruction , and other aspects of life in Taiwan .
On the subject of cross-strait relations , Chen stressed that the people of Taiwan and mainland China share a common ancestral , cultural , and historical background , and he stated his belief that the leaders on both sides have the wisdom and creativity to jointly deal with the question of a future " one China . "
He also promised that during his presidency , as long as the Communist Party regime renounces the use of military force against Taiwan , he will : -LRB- 1 -RRB- not declare independence ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- not change the nation 's name ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- not push for the inclusion of the " state - to - state " formula in the constitution ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- not promote a referendum on Taiwan independence ; and -LRB- 5 -RRB- not seek to abolish the National Reunification Council or the National Reunification Guidelines .
He also had a message for his international audience , promising to make a more active contribution to safeguarding international human rights .
He stated that Taiwan would abide by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , and the Vienna Declaration and Program of Action .
He also indicated that the new government would request the Legislative Yuan to pass and ratify the International Bill of Rights as a domestic law of Taiwan , so that it would formally become the " Taiwan Bill of Rights . "
Later in the day , Taiwan 's various political parties all released statements on the inaugural address .
Chang Jung - kung , director - general of the Kuomintang 's Department of Mainland Affairs , stated that Chen failed to break any new ground in his statements on cross-strait relations , and said that while Chen had succeeded in calming the atmosphere for the time being , the stalemate remains unresolved .
The People First Party -LRB- PFP -RRB- and New Party -LRB- NP -RRB- gave a more positive evaluation .
PFP Secretary - General David Chung felt that the president had sent a positive signal to the mainland , but that his domestic policy lacked the sense of direction that would come from a comprehensive vision .
NP convener Hau Lung - pin commended Chen for his finessing of the " one China " issue .
Beijing responded almost immediately to Chen 's speech .
While expressing dissatisfaction at his avoidance of the " one China " issue , they also stated that it might be possible to re-start cross-strait negotiations if Taiwan were willing to return to the one China formula adopted during talks in 1992 , when it was agreed that each side could maintain its own interpretation of what " one China " means .
US President Bill Clinton praised Chen 's speech as pragmatic and constructive , and stated his hope that the two sides would be able to resume dialogue at an early date .
Japan 's Foreign Minister Yohei Kono also commented favorably , indicating his government 's hope that the two sides can engage in dialogue and work for a peaceful resolution of the cross-strait issue now that the new president has taken office .
In addition to heads of state and representatives from countries with which Taiwan enjoys either formal diplomatic ties or friendly relations , the inaugural was also attended by three generations of democracy activists from mainland China -LRB- Lin Xiling , Wei Jingsheng , and Wang Dan -RRB- and Lech Walesa , the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize winner and former president of Poland .
All these visitors complimented Chen Shui - bian for his speech and expressed support for Taiwan 's determination to follow the path of democracy , freedom , and peace .
On the evening of inauguration day , Chen Shui - bian carried out two functions at the Grand Hotel .
After hosting a gathering of DPP members on one floor of the hotel , the president then proceeded to an official state banquet for VIPs on another floor of the same hotel .
At the DPP function , party chairman Lin Yi - hsiung had a word of caution for his fellow party members : " We must not let our newly attained power go to our heads . "
There was also a big inaugural celebration on the big square that evening at the Chiang Kai - shek Memorial .
The celebration moved the next evening to Kaohsiung , and other celebrations went on all across the island .
The Sun Yat - sen Memorial Hall marked the occasion by holding a special exhibit of contemporary Chinese painting , and all sorts of hot - selling commemorative products appeared on the market , including alcoholic beverages , coins , pens , etc .
Everyone has high hopes for the new presidency , but we must remember that May 20th is just the first step on a long journey .
If a brighter future is to actually take shape , the government and citizens will have to work for it .

Pop diva Chang Hui - mei sang the ROC national anthem at the inaugural and angered the Chinese communists , who reacted by pulling her long - running Sprite commercials from the air and banning the sale of her music .
No one had expected a pop star like Ah - mei to get embroiled in cross-strait politics .

Walking the Safe and Narrow
New Strategic Thinking for the Defense of Taiwan
-LRB- Eric Lin / photos by Diago Chiu /
tr. by Phil Newell -RRB-
The last of this generation of domestically produced Ching - kuo fighter planes takes off for routine maneuvers .
Defense thinking in Taiwan is changing to meet the challenges of advanced technology .
As the first Chinese New Year of the new millenium approaches , changes are underway which are drawing attention to the long - term prospects for military and defense affairs in Taiwan .
The Legislative Yuan has finally passed the long - discussed National Defense Law and Coastal Defense Law .
These establish new regulations governing issues which have long been a focus of public concern , including unification of the military chain of command , alteration of the weapons procurement process , establishment of a flexible military service system , and transfer of defense responsibilities for remote offshore islands .
In addition , as the presidential election battle heats up , cross-strait security issues - especially those related to missiles and missile defense - have again come up in Taiwan , with candidates rushing to put forward their own strategic thinking .
Faced with the turbulent cross-strait situation , can Taiwan 's military ensure security ?
How should Taiwan respond to mainland China 's active development of a missile attack capability ?
Will pro-active construction of a missile defense system raise tensions between the two sides ?
How can Taiwan defend itself without provoking an irrational response from mainland China ?
Two national defense topics have been especially hot in this new year .
One is that defense of the remote Pratas and Spratley Islands will be transferred to the Coast Guard Command .
The second is the subject of missile defense .
Both Kuomintang presidential candidate Lien Chan and Democratic Progressive Party presidential candidate Chen Shui - bian have commented on the subject .
Last December , at a seminar at the Armed Forces University entitled " Transmillennial National Security and Military Strategy , " Lien delivered an address entitled " National Defense Strategy and Construction in the New Century . "
He suggested that Taiwan will have to develop long - range missiles to counter the mainland Chinese military threat .
While " effective deterrence " would remain the cornerstone of strategy , it should no longer be passive , said Lien , but " pro-active . "
The new generation of military capability will be based , he said , on the principle of " offensive defense . "
The best defense is ....
Chen raised a similar idea .
In his " Defense Policy White Paper , " he proposed developing medium - and short - range surface - to - surface missiles .
Obviously , after the experience of the 1996 Taiwan Strait missile crisis , people in Taiwan have considered defending the island against mainland Chinese missile attack to be one of the foremost defense problems .
Interestingly , even as such " pro-active defense " ideas are being proposed , the Ministry of National Defense -LRB- MND -RRB- has made a seemingly contrary move : It has announced that military forces will be withdrawn from the remote offshore Pratas and Spratley islands , and that responsibility for these islands and for coastal patrolling will be transferred to the Coast Guard .
The MND argues that since the military is being streamlined , in order to concentrate defense forces in Taiwan , Penghu , Kinmen , and Matsu , the defense of the Pratas and Spratley islands - which are in the South China Sea - and the protection of coastal fishing vessels and coastal security should be left to the Coast Guard .
Withdrawing from the two islands groups while moving actively to build a missile system may look like contradictory moves , but in fact they 're both part of the military blueprint for the future - the abandonment of initial use of military force , but the ability to retaliate when attacked .
The military blueprint for the new century is still being drawn up .
The stimulus for these new ideas has been the aggressive military deployments by mainland China aimed at Taiwan .
Lin Cheng - yi , a research fellow at the Institute of European and American Affairs at the Academia Sinica , says that the successful testing by mainland China of missiles in 1996 has altered the lines of strategic thought on both sides of the strait .
Guided missiles have replaced aircraft as the major threat to Taiwan .
In recent years mainland China has also constructed short - range surface - to - surface missile bases along its Southeast Coast which are specifically targeted at Taiwan .
According to a report in the December 22 , 1999 Washington Post , in November US reconnaissance satellites discovered that the PRC had begun constructing a new air defense missile base in the Zhangzhou region along the southeast coast .
Lin Cheng - yi says that , besides rapidly building missile bases , the PRC has repeatedly stated that " there should be a timetable for resolution of the Taiwan problem . "
The PRC 's extremely assertive deployment of armed capability opposite Taiwan is deeply felt in the ROC .
If Taiwan does not respond in time , it will be forced into an increasingly passive position .
Lt. Gen. Fuh Wei - ku , commandant of the Air Command and General Staff College at the Armed Forces University , notes that for the moment Taiwan still has a slight edge in terms of air defense .
However , it is widely estimated that by 2005 , there will be a shift in the military capabilities of the two sides .
Although this prediction is not necessarily accurate , Taiwan should work to maintain its edge so as to guarantee peace through strength .
Fuh Wei - ku offers the following analysis : Currently the PRC weapons which pose the greatest threat to Taiwan are Sukhoi aircraft , M - class missiles , and cruise missiles .
Of these , the aircraft are already strategically of the second rank , but Taiwan must be alert to the missiles .
The M - class weapons can pass through the stratosphere directly into Taiwan 's rear areas , while cruise missiles can undertake low - level long - range attacks .
" We can defend against the M - class missiles with our Patriot missile defense system , but we currently have only limited ability to intercept cruise missiles .
The most important subject for the moment is to rethink air defense strategy , " he says .
Missile difficulties
Any discussion of missiles also involves many other issues , including international strategy and domestic civilian morale .
From the point of view of international strategy , the US clearly does not want Taiwan to develop its own offensive missile capability .
The US responded negatively to Lien Chan 's proposal to build long - range missiles .
At the State Department 's end - of - year press conference , US Under Secretary of State for Arms Control John Holum said that the US did not want to see Taiwan take any action which would violate the basic norms of the 1987 Missile Technology Control Regime .
Thus the US would not be happy to see Taiwan develop offensive long - range missile systems .
Kuo Cheng - liang , a professor of political science at Soochow University , says that the US opposes Taiwan 's development of long - range missiles because of the US 's long - range strategy vis - a - vis China .
The US has always been responsible for strategic deterrence , while Taiwan handles local tactical defense .
If Taiwan were to develop long - range missiles , this would change Taiwan 's defensive posture , and alter the Taiwan - US military division of labor .
There is another possibility for Taiwan in defending against the threat of missiles from the PRC .
Besides building offensive systems , Taiwan could also join the US Theater Missile Defense -LRB- TMD -RRB- plan .
But this may not be feasible , says Bih Chung - ho , editor - in - chief of the defense magazine Defense Technology Monthly .
He says that if Taiwan were to join the TMD this would be a return to a situation of joint US - Taiwan defense , such as existed during the Cold War , when Taiwan was on the frontline in a chain of islands surrounding China .
For the PRC , which is endeavoring to move from coastal defense to a blue - water capability , the provocation would be enormous .
The United States has thus been deliberately unclear - it does not exclude Taiwan from the TMD , but it has not clearly said that Taiwan would be included .
In any case , says Lin Chong - pin , vice-chairman of the ROC 's Mainland Affairs Council , potential TMD buyers still do not know where the money would come from , while the TMD producer has not yet come up with a finished product .
So this is still just a political debating point , and it is too early to talk about any impact on the military situation in the Taiwan Strait .
Domestic morale
Thus , from the international strategic angle , it still seems most practical for Taiwan to have its own missile systems .
Moreover , this is also necessary from the point of view of public opinion .
In an analysis of the threat that guided missiles pose to morale in Taiwan , ROC Minister of Defense Tang Fei points out that perhaps for some countries a missile attack would have little impact .
But in Taiwan , where resources are concentrated , missiles pose a serious threat to electrical power and petroleum production , to transportation -LRB- harbors , highways , airports , railroads -RRB- , and to factories .
More importantly , he says , the citizens of Taiwan are not psychologically prepared .
There has been no war for decades now , and there are even very few usable civil defense shelters .
If the PRC were to launch 200 - 300 guided missiles against Taiwan , although the damage to industry , power , and communications would probably not be as serious as was caused by the September 21 earthquake , citizens are not psychologically prepared for war , and the economy might not be able to withstand the assault .
Chung Chien , an expert on military affairs , says that the turbulence created in the public mind by the 1996 PRC missile tests has not abated even today .
The construction of an effective missile defense system is the main military problem in bringing peace of mind to Taiwan citizens .
Thus , in the presidential elections , although missile defense can not be said to be " the beef " of campaigning , it is still an important " side dish " that many citizens are concerned about .
Beyond missiles
If Taiwan can not develop long - range missiles or participate in the TMD plan , what effective strategic options are left ?
Fuh Wei - ku points out that Taiwan 's domestically produced Sky Bow and Sky Sword missiles have defensive capability .
But pure defense is not enough .
Even if missile defense could be 99 % effective , and only one percent of attacking missiles got through , the situation could still be a total loss .
Thus , it would be more effective to build an offensive missile system to deter the enemy .
Taiwan 's domestically produced Hsiung Feng missiles have over - the - horizon attack capability , and could remain the main focus of future research and development .
Bih Chung - ho adds that it should be no problem , using the resources of the Chungshan Institute of Technology , to manufacture short - range surface - to - surface missiles -LRB- SSMs -RRB- without relying on purchases from overseas .
Previous missile programs , including the Ching Feng and Tien Ma , all envisioned similar short - range SSMs -LRB- with a range of 500 or so kilometers -RRB- .
Lin Cheng - yi says that it is indeed feasible for Taiwan 's military to develop an effective retaliatory capability ; development could focus on short - range SSMs and an air - to - surface attack capability , which could expand the battlefield beyond Taiwan .
Lin points to other countries that have a doctrine of extending the battlefield outside national territory .
For example , South Korea has developed its own SSMs , Singapore has airborne refueling capability , and Israel has a strategy of keeping the fighting outside its borders as much as possible .
Of course , different countries are in different situations , and the external threats faced by these countries are not comparable to the cross-strait situation .
PRC military affairs expert Alex Kao concludes that although the idea of taking a war beyond Taiwan is worth consideration , it would only be really useful if it could be adopted into the national security structure and done in an integrated and comprehensive way .
Defense alternatives
Although constructing a missile system is a main focus of defense thinking in Taiwan , effective use of high - tech weaponry depends on the quality of military personnel and , moreover , can not be seen as a panacea for all defense problems .
The problem of personnel quality has in fact been a focus of serious concern in recent years .
For example , over the last two years the Air Force has lost six fighter planes in accidents , revealing a serious weakness in managing high - tech weapons .
Fuh Wei - ku says that the problem is not one of integrating the different types of weaponry bought from the " mini-United Nations " of sources from which Taiwan has acquired high - tech arms , because the military accounted for this problem already .
Rather , the main problem is in the nation 's military service system , which makes it difficult to retain soldiers long enough to cultivate expertise .
Most of the problems with high - tech weapons have in fact been human error .
At the ceremony marking the commissioning of the fifth F - 16 squadron held last December in Hualien , there were " more planes than pilots . "
This newly established 26th Fighter Squadron has 18 fighter aircraft , but less than 10 pilots .
According to the Air Force , this problem is the result of the transition period to a new generation of aircraft .
For pilots to qualify for the new aircraft , they must have at least 400 hours of flying experience .
But Taiwan 's pilots get limited time in the air , so there are n't enough qualified pilots .
Experts explain that Taiwan has limited airspace , and virtually no space for training .
Moreover , it seems , virtually all of the first group of pilots who went abroad to receive training for new fighter aircraft have left the military to fly for civilian airlines , so the problem of talent outflows is severe .
The same applies to other types of high - tech material .
Defense alternatives
Although constructing a missile system is a main focus of defense thinking in Taiwan , effective use of high - tech weaponry depends on the quality of military personnel and , moreover , can not be seen as a panacea for all defense problems .
The problem of personnel quality has in fact been a focus of serious concern in recent years .
For example , over the last two years the Air Force has lost six fighter planes in accidents , revealing a serious weakness in managing high - tech weapons .
Fuh Wei - ku says that the problem is not one of integrating the different types of weaponry bought from the " mini-United Nations " of sources from which Taiwan has acquired high - tech arms , because the military accounted for this problem already .

The same applies to other types of high - tech material .
Doctrine , not weapons
It is bad enough that high - tech weapons may be rendered irrelevant by the inability to utilize them properly .
Another problem is that they might be bypassed altogether by a different enemy strategy .
Alex Kao warns that currently both public commentators and the military 's own research focus on the possibility that the first wave of warfare in the Taiwan Strait will be a missile attack .
This ignores the evolution of land - sea - air joint operations in modern warfare .
Mainland China need not choose to use high - cost , limited - quantity guided missiles , but could instead use a large number of 360 - km range rockets to first attack Taiwan 's air fields from the Chinese coast , thereby paralyzing Taiwan 's air superiority .
Then , their navy could ferry raiders to Taiwan in less than one hour .
Kao recalls that Vietnamese land forces were used to infiltrate US air fields in Vietnam and neutralize American air superiority .
Particularly now that the Coastal Defense Law has been passed , and responsibility for coastal patrols will pass to the non-military Coast Guard Command , if Taiwan 's military still operates under the traditional assumption of first establishing air and sea superiority followed by defense on land , this could give mainland China an opportunity to strike a death blow .
" Although this is merely a hypothesis , it points to a blind spot : the first strike will not necessarily be missiles .
A solid national defense requires that no possibility be overlooked , " he concludes .
Third wave warfare
Even as discussion on missile systems continues , an unprecedented form of threat - third - wave warfare - is lurking .
Lin Chong - pin says that currently both sides are engaged in third - wave - warfare development .
This type of warfare is divided into " hard kill " and " soft kill . "
Hard kill refers to the deployment on missile warheads of weapons with directional capability - using , for example , lasers , microwaves , electromagnetic pulse , and particle beams - which could increase the destructiveness of missiles .
" Soft kill " refers to computer viruses and electronic interference to destroy the enemy 's computer systems , and thereby to neutralize the enemy 's military capability in a bloodless manner .
Some people see in third - wave warfare an opportunity to seize a decisive advantage in the face of a future armed threat from mainland China .
To be sure , because of the domestic development of the electronics industry in Taiwan , the ROC has a certain advantage .
The military is currently actively studying the construction of information war capability , and it hopes to cooperate with the private sector and utilize private - sector computer knowledge to jointly deploy an electronics defense network .
This is a key area of development for the future in which Taiwan can rely on itself and need not be limited by what can be procured abroad .
Construction of a complete defense system is essential , but the highest form of military strategy is still to defeat the enemy without firing a shot .
In fact , the pro-active defense Taiwan is currently studying is a way of pursuing peace .
Taiwan will not provoke mainland China , nor be the first to resort to war .
But nor can it allow the PRC to think that Taiwan is so weak that the PRC will be tempted to act rashly .
Pro-active defense is necessary for Taiwan , but the real goal of the Taiwan side is peace .
Perhaps militarily there 's a standoff situation of mutual intimidation , but what Taiwan most hopes for is that the cross-strait problem can be peacefully resolved without deploying a single soldier .
Terracotta Warriors Invade Taipei
-LRB- Tsai Wen - ting / tr. by David Mayer -RRB-
The terracotta warriors from the tomb of Qin Shi Huang , which is included on the list of World Heritage sites of the UNESCO , have come ashore in Taiwan !
The 17 warriors now on display at the National Museum of History represent the largest contingent from the ancient tomb ever to travel on loan outside of mainland China .
" Reporting to the general , sir !
A mob of thousands has surrounded the building ! "
A mounted warrior delivers the dire news to his commander , whose high rank can be seen in his tasseled helmet and coat of mail .
The " mob , " of course , is thirsty not for blood .
They just want a glimpse of the warriors .
Although the warriors may not be aware of it , they are the star attraction at a blockbuster exhibit showing now at the National Museum of History in Taipei .
Since opening on December 15 , the exhibit has touched off a wave of enthusiasm in Taiwan for the terracotta warriors , and lines for admission have often snaked along the street for hundreds of meters .
Over 20,000 advance tickets have been sold , and group visits are already booked solid to the end of January .
Many schools in central and southern Taiwan are renting buses by the dozen to ferry their students up to Taipei , and lots of foreign tourists are also coming by for a look .
Eighth wonder
Shaanxi Province was hit by a long drought in the summer of 1974 .
The farmer Yang Zhifa and a neighbor were digging a well when a shovel clinked on something hard .
Yang exclaimed , " Whoa ! It 's them ! "
Locals had talked for generations about the buried clay figures that they would sometimes run across while digging in the fields .
Everyone knew they were out there , but no one knew quite what they were .
People figured they must have been connected with ancestral spirits of some sort .
Anxious not to run afoul of the netherworld , the farmers would always hurriedly throw dirt back over the spot and find a better place to dig .
This time , however , Yang Zhifa went a step further .
He reported the incident to his superiors at the local commune .
It was n't long before archeologists were swarming over the site , unearthing an army of terracotta warriors that had lain buried for over 2,000 years .
The stunning discovery was dubbed the eighth wonder of the world .
The terracotta army gives a graphic illustration of the grand scale of Qin Shi Huang 's ambitions .
It also shows how technologically advanced China already was when Qin Shi Huang was buried some 2,200 years ago .
In order to create the feel of an actual descent into the emperor 's tomb , the museum has arranged the exhibit so that visitors enter on the second floor and descend from there into a tomb - like atmosphere on the first floor , where the dimly lit space affords a glimpse of what was on the emperor 's mind during the years he was busily uniting China for the very first time in history .
The afterlife
Qin Shi Huang united China in the year 221 B.C .
He regarded his achievements as " surpassing those of the Three Kings and Five Emperors of old , " and appointed himself " the first true emperor , " or Qin Shi Huang .
A believer in the possibility of immortality , the emperor once dispatched a trusted aide on a voyage across the seas to search for magic herbs that would provide eternal youth .
Perhaps as " plan B , " he also poured vast resources into the construction of a burial mound equipped with all the accoutrements that he was accustomed to in the here and now .
The population of the kingdom of Qin at that time was about 20 million , of whom over 2 million were mobilized to bring his grand underground palace to completion .
Now that the complex has been discovered , it is unquestionably the life - size terracotta warriors and horses that inspire the most amazement .
The 8,000 figures that have been unearthed at the site in Shaanxi Province were all executed with painstaking realism .
The rank of each figure determined every little detail of its making , right down to the type of military uniform , cap , armor , hairstyle , and beard .
Artisans even incised the soles of the soldiers ' shoes to show the threads , and made sure the horses ' teeth were realistically done .
Each face is unique .
Some characters project an air of stern authority .
Others suggest a fierce and violent personality .
Still other faces clearly belong to tender , untested young greenhorns .
The tremendous individuality in the warriors never fails to amaze .
Indeed , there are people who subscribe to the rumor that each clay figure encloses the corpse of a real person .
Careful inspection of the markings on the figures reveals that about 90 " master craftsmen " participated in the making of the terracotta warriors , each supported by a team of ten or more assistants .
The total number of artisans involved probably came to nearly a thousand .
Some of them were employed by imperial kilns , while others came from private establishments .
It was a huge undertaking , for each figure had to be shaped , molded , kneaded , sculpted , and painted .
Decorative relief elements had to be applied .
The figures had to be covered with an off - white slip to approximate the color of skin .
The hair , too , had to be appropriately colored .
Even the horses were painted in appropriate shades of reddish - brown and black .
Their tongues were done in pink , and their teeth in white .
The soldiers stand a surprising 180 centimeters in height , prompting many to ask whether the men of that time were actually taller than their modern counterparts .
There are two different theories concerning this question , says Wu Yongqi , the head of the Museum of Terracotta Warriors .
In Taipei for the exhibit , Wu explains that some say it is natural that the figures should be taller since people from China 's northwest - where the Qin kingdom was located - have always been taller than other Chinese .
Others , however , theorize that the artisans intentionally made the figures slightly larger than life to compensate for the shrinkage that would take place while the freshly molded figures were drying .
The cultured side of Qin
But if you visit the exhibit , do n't be so dazzled by the terracotta figures that you forget all about the exhibit 's larger focus on Qin artifacts in general .
Tu Cheng - sheng , director of the National Palace Museum , stated after visiting the exhibit that most of our knowledge concerning the Qin dynasty comes from official dynastic histories authored during the Han period .
These later authors generally had a jaundiced view of the Qin , and tended to focus on the ruthless , autocratic rule of Qin Shi Huang while paying less attention to the positive achievements of Qin culture , or the beauty of Qin handicrafts .
A round eaves - tile at the exhibit features an image of a running deer , its stout , robust frame executed with startling skill .
An elderly visitor was overheard exclaiming to his wife : " They made such beautiful tiles !
I wonder if we can even do anything that nice today ? "
Also featured at the exhibit are two replicas of brass Qin - period chariots on loan from the Taiwanese art collector Huang Jen - chung and the National Museum of Natural Science .
Each chariot is assembled from over 7,000 different pieces , and is half the size of the original , which has been described as " the most extraordinary bronze piece ever made " on account of its huge size , complex structure , and lifelike realism .
In addition , scholars have discovered that the bronze weapons unearthed along with the soldiers all have a different percentage of copper and tin , depending on their purpose .
Arrowheads , with their requirement for hardness and ability to penetrate armor , had a higher ratio of tin than other weapons .
And a bronze sword , found bent out of shape from the weight of fallen clay figures sitting on it for two millennia , sprang back immediately to its original shape once the heavy objects were removed from on top of it .
It is evident that the bronze metalworkers of that time were very highly skilled .
The exhibit will remain in Taiwan until March 11 .
The National Museum of History is open from 10:00 to 18:00 on weekdays and 09:30 to 18:00 on weekends and holidays .
In order to give persons with disabilities a chance to view the exhibit without having to fight the crowds , the museum will provide free admission just for these special guests every Wednesday at 09:00 .
The wait for admission has sometimes taken two to three hours , but the crowds are likely to grow gradually smaller with time , so it might be a good idea to wait a few weeks before heading to the museum .
In the meantime , you can find lots of information on the exhibit , including a virtual tour , on the Internet at http://www.qin.com.tw .

These 2,200 - year - old officers and soldiers stand a head taller than their modern counterparts .
Were the men of old really so tall ?
Or did they only select the biggest and strongest to serve in the army ?
Or were the artisans simply exaggerating ?
There are many competing explanations on this score .

Home Is Where the Heart Is Community Activism in a Small Hakka Town
-LRB- Chang Chiung - fang / photos by Hsueh Chi - kuang / tr. by David Mayer -RRB-
Last year 's earthquake may have de-stroyed families and toppled homes , but it also brought people closer together and created new links between local communities .
This has especially been the case with Peipu -LRB- Hsinchu County -RRB- and Shihkang -LRB- Taichung County -RRB- .
These two rural towns are alike in many ways .
Each is predominantly Hakka , each is located in north - central Taiwan , and each has about 10,000 inhabitants .
Since last year , however , there has been one huge difference -
the earthquake decimated Shihkang but left Peipu virtually unscathed .
The earthquake killed more people in Shihkang than any other township in Taiwan , and Shihkang remains largely in ruins a half year later .
Peipu , in the meantime , enjoys a booming tourist industry that just keeps growing .
Since the earthquake , Peipu 's Ta Ai Community Affairs Center -LRB- TCAC -RRB- has lent sustained assistance to Shihkang in a remarkable display of how a disaster can bring out the best in people .
" Donations and volunteers came flooding in immediately after the earthquake , " says Shihkang mayor Hsieh Chen - ying , " but we all knew that it would n't last for long .
The task of rebuilding is the hard part .
It 's going to take a long time . "
The city of Taipei " adopted " Shihkang after the earthquake , assigning personnel from its various ward offices to stay on long - term in Shihkang and assist with earthquake recovery .
Mighty Taipei , however , is joined in this task by Peipu 's TCAC , which is among the few organizations that have provided continuous assistance ever since the quake .
Peipu lends a helping hand
Says Shu Shih - wei , director of TCAC , " There is just so much to do after a disaster of this magnitude .
TCAC and the people of Peipu have only got so many resources . "
In the little community of Peipu , TCAC managed to collect three truckloads of relief supplies and over NT$ 400,000 after the earthquake .
In order to put it to the best possible use , they toured the disaster area several times and decided to devote all their energies to help the recovery effort in the township of Shihkang in Taichung County .
The two towns are not so far apart - about two hours by car .
Besides their common ethnicity , the seriousness of the damage in Shihkang was a major reason why TCAC chose to concentrate on Shihkang .
Shihkang is located on the banks of the Tachia River , and was one of the areas most heavily hit by the quake , with 178 deaths , over 1,200 buildings totally destroyed , more than 500 homes partially destroyed , and dozens of historic old structures demolished .
TCAC had already been active in community development efforts in Peipu , and its members knew from this experience that rebuilding from the earthquake would take a long time , so they set up Shihkang Work Station at Tuniu Elementary School in late October and made plans to stay for a year .
Shihkang Newsletter
The main task of the Work Station is to publish the fortnightly Shihkang Newsletter .
The first edition of this one - page newsletter went out last November 8th .
It reports on everyday life in the disaster area and matters related to the recovery effort .
TCAC 's Li Chieh - ying has been working full - time at the Shihkang Work Station since November .
According to Li , the newsletter is extremely important to people in the disaster area for a couple of reasons .
Firstly , it enables people to share information .
People can see that they are not alone in their suffering , and that they must address their situation from a collective standpoint instead of chasing after individual problems one at a time .
Secondly , people in the disaster area need information from the outside world , and now that the news media have shifted their attention to other matters , the local people need an avenue by which to get their message out to the rest of the world .
The newsletter is just the thing to accomplish these objectives .
This newsletter has also helped to spur increased contact between the people of Peipu and Shihkang .
According to Li Chieh - ying , they distribute 3,000 copies of the Shihkang Newsletter in Shihkang , 500 in Tungshih and Shinshe , and 1,000 in Peipu , which enables the people of Peipu to truly get a feel for what is needed in the disaster area .
By sending a person to serve full - time at the Shihkang Work Station , TCAC has managed to quickly integrate itself into the local community in Shihkang , and to see where assistance is most urgently needed .
The children of Shihkang , for example , are in especially great need of psychological counseling , so TCAC asked the Hsiuh - li Liuh Memorial Foundation to provide therapy for children and teachers .
In addition , the Shihkang Work Station is also helping to build prefab shelters .
The Far Eastern group only donated 50 prefab units , and people in less than privileged situations -LRB- such as renters and those living in illegally constructed residences -RRB- were not even eligible to apply for them , so TCAC has been working hard to put up prefab units for the residents of Tzu - yun Lane .
Several old residences collapsed there , causing numerous deaths and injuries .
The work on the prefab units has been a race against time , for as Shu Shih - wei points out , some people in the disaster area have died of cold over the winter .
To survive the great earthquake only to die because of an inadequate relief effort seems the height of injustice .
A non-Hakka in Peipu
How has TCAC managed to deliver such steady assistance to people in the disaster area ?
What do they have that sets them apart ?
It all has to do with their experience with community activism in Peipu .
You wo n't find the name Ta Ai on a map of Hsinchu County , for it is an administrative division not of the ROC government , but of the famous Yimin Temple of northern Hsinchu .
The Ta Ai area encompasses the three townships of Peipu , Paoshan , and Omei .
Yimin Temple commands the allegiance of Hakka faithful in 15 different temple districts , of which the Ta Ai district is one .
Peipu Township lies immediately southwest of the town of Chutung , and is surrounded by mountains .
Over 95 % of its roughly 12,000 residents are Hakka .
Located in the center of Peipu is Tzu - tien Temple , the town 's main landmark , and the bustling streets that run past the temple offer the best shopping and eating in town .
TCAC operates out of an office in the middle of town .
The traditional architecture of the building is a very pleasant sight .
Shu Shih - wei , the key mover and shaker at TCAC , was born to parents from the mainland and grew up in Kaohsiung .
Formerly a professor at Chung Yuan Christian University , he first came to Peipu ago to help a colleague study the local architecture .
Shu 's role in the project was to study the sociology of Peipu and gain a clear understanding of life in a small Hakka town .
Shu ended up staying on in Peipu after the project came to an end , and today he serves as director of TCAC .
Says Shu , " Now I can understand about 60 - 70 % of what people say in Hakka ! "
How it all started
TCAC was established almost by accident .
After settling in Peipu , Shu gradually put down roots in the local community and made friends .
In the summer of 1996 , Shu and a few women got to talking about education and they hatched an idea to set up an after - school study center .
The local Catholic church donated space for the center , and the project was soon launched .
They also set up a small library , and local residents generously donated many books .
Thanks to the center , a group of concerned local citizens started seeing each other quite frequently , and they ended up establishing Ta Ai Community Affairs Center in March 1997 .
They chose Chiang Yi - sen , the owner of a local dry goods store , as the chairman , and selected Shu as director .
The new organization resolved to work toward the achievement of four goals : " A better standard of living , in both the material and spiritual sense .
Preservation and development of Hakka culture .
Preservation of the environment and development of local industry .
Development of community education for people of all ages . "
After TCAC was officially established , its main project was the publication of a bimonthly newsletter .
The TCAC Newsletter provided the people of Peipu with an opportunity to speak their minds on such issues as preservation of local streams , their love for their hometown , and various local affairs .
Pitching in
A young man wrote in the TCAC Newsletter , " I used to have a job in another town , and every time I came back to Peipu I would go straight to the noodle shop and wolf down a bowl of bantiao noodles even before stopping to say hello to my parents .
Until I had eaten a bowl of bantiao , I did n't feel like I was back home yet . "
According to Shu Shih - wei , keeping the newsletter in print for two or three years has been no small accomplishment .
" These people do n't write for a living .
A person might spend four or five hours writing up a short little article . "
In addition to the newsletter , TCAC has also been involved in many local activities .
" A lot of interesting stuff goes on in a small Hakka town , " says Shu , adding that when help is needed the locals are likely to contribute not just money but something even more valuable - their time and energy .
When TCAC puts on an activity , for example , if someone notices that an event organizer is getting thirsty they will immediately bring him a bottle of mineral water .
When a musical performance is scheduled , someone will always take it upon themselves to set out seats for the audience .
" If the local residents agree with what you 're doing , they 're sure to pitch in and help , " says Shu , who considers this spirit of volunteerism much more valuable than monetary donations .
That is why TCAC has been able to carry out so many activities over the past three years without spending any money .
Peipu residents have taken part enthusiastically in recycling campaigns , flea markets , and post-harvest yam roasts , and events of this nature have even drawn participants from out of town .
According to Chiang Yi - sen , when TCAC organized a camping trip last year , participants from Chutung , Toufen , and elsewhere actually outnumbered the locals .
We miss our walkways !
Thanks to the energy and dedication of nine regular staff and many enthusiastic volunteers , TCAC has managed to make a difference in this small Hakka township over the past three years .
Most notably , the people of Peipu have begun to sense the value of what they 've got in their community .
The campaign to beautify Peipu 's Hsia Street is an excellent case in point .
Seven years ago , in order to ease the problem of increasing traffic congestion , the township widened Hsia Street .
The project required demolition of all the covered walkways that used to stand outside the stores there .
It seemed like a laudable move toward modernization at the time , but people living along the street came to rue the loss of their covered walkways .
Cars came roaring down in great numbers along the widened street , while the residents lost the space in front of their homes where they had once enjoyed many a leisurely hour .
According to Chiang Yi - sen , whose store is located on Hsia Street , everybody used to congregate in the cool shade of the walkways in the summer .
Neighbors were more involved with each other , and his two children always had a place to play .
Now that the covered walkways have been replaced by parking spaces , people scarcely leave their homes .
The old folks stay inside watching television , while the young people only emerge briefly on their way to work .
People rarely have a chance to speak to each other anymore .
Fortunately , the people of Peipu quickly realized their mistake .
Last year TCAC applied to the Council for Cultural Affairs for authorization to carry out a campaign to beautify Hsia Street .
The residents did everything they could to restore something of their former neighborhood .
They erected street lamps and put out benches where people could sit and chat , and have succeeded in creating a very friendly atmosphere .
The gaily lit Hsia Street seems almost to have returned to an earlier time .
It might be impossible for Hsia Street to ever be exactly the same as it once was , but the beautification campaign taught the people of Peipu the value of what they have .
When the town hall made plans to rip up the stone steps on the long pathway leading up the mountainside at Hsiuluan Park and replace them with imported stone , local citizens protested , asking the town hall to leave the steps as they were .
In the end they succeeded in keeping part of the steps untouched .
States Chiang with a sigh , " There 's not much left that 's really worth passing on to our grandchildren .
We ca n't keep destroying things . "
Do you remember ?
The scope of TCAC activities is not limited to improving the quality of old neighborhoods .
The organization is also active in the effort to preserve the local environment .
Shu Shih - wei points out that for an agricultural community like Peipu , streams are an indispensable resource .
Aquatic life on Taping River , however , is dwindling due to destruction of the surrounding environment and excessive gravel mining on the river bed .
Last April , over 50 people from the townships of Peipu and Omei organized the TCAC Taping River Preservation Team .
In addition to holding meetings throughout the local area to show slides and publicize the river 's plight , the River Preservation Team also posted notices on the riverbank in May asking locals and out - of - town visitors not to poison or electrocute fish or catch them in nets .
The team also goes out occasionally to pick up trash and patrol the river .
Besides these activities , TCAC also offers regularly scheduled classes for both children and adults .
Current offerings include a class on environmental preservation for children , while for both children and adults there are classes on calligraphy , traditional Hakka folk songs , and local history .
Every Wednesday evening you can hear the strains of Hakka folk songs coming from TCAC .
The youngest participants in the class are just seven or eight , while the oldest range on up to 70 or 80 .
Every one of the lilting melodies carries with it a nugget of Hakka culture .
Even more interestingly , the teacher makes up lyrics about the river preservation campaign and sets them to traditional folk melodies , thus melding the old and the new .
In the class on local history , the participants themselves do all the talking .
They exchange stories about the past and talk about places whose names no longer even appear on the maps .
Everyone works in this way to call up a collective memory of local history .
Says Shu Shih - wei , " By sharing our experiences we can get everybody to take an active interest in the changes that are taking place in the local community . "
Outgrowths of the class include the river preservation campaign and a guidebook for tourists interested in learning about environmental issues and local history .
Says Shu , " Forget about all the high - falutin' talk about ' urban redevelopment ' and whatnot - everyone cares about what goes on in their town .
But you 've got to find a way to get everybody working together so you can actually get something done , otherwise all talk about local affairs wo n't amount to anything more than people doing a bit of idle chatting and complaining around the dinner table . "
Hard times , warm hearts
With such a vigorous network of local volunteers already in place , TCAC was prepared to act quickly when the earthquake hit central Taiwan last September .
After zeroing in on Shihkang as the beneficiary of its assistance , TCAC wasted no time in sending relief supplies , establishing a newsletter , and building prefab shelters .
In working together on the recovery effort , the people of Peipu and Shihkang have built up close personal ties .
At a New Year 's celebration in Peipu , Shihkang mayor Hsieh Chen - ying gave the people of Peipu a gift as a token of gratitude for their generous assistance , and when TCAC board members traveled to Shihkang to inspect the progress on the prefab shelters , they took advantage of the occasion to exchange views with local residents .
" I 'm very excited about the two - way channel of communication that we 've established , " says Li Chieh - ying , and he adds that this communication is a source of strength that has enabled the Shihkang Work Station to keep going .
The prefab units that TCAC helped build at Tuniu Elementary School were completed on February 28th , and Li Chieh - ying reports that the Shihkang Work Station is now concentrating primarily on gaining a clear picture of what is needed to get people back to work .
Although the original plan only calls for the Shihkang Work Station to operate for one year , Li Chieh - ying opines , " I have my doubts about whether we 'll actually be able to leave after a year . "
He feels that the cooperative relationship and emotional ties that have been forged between Peipu and Shihkang ought to be kept alive , and he hopes that the people of Ta Ai will be able to share their know - how in community activism with other localities so that Taiwan can recover the vibrant communities that it lost in the earthquake .

The people of Peipu have come to understand the value of their heritage , and have begun working to preserve old buildings .
In restoring old residences , they are eschewing modern building materials and using the methods of the past .

English Instruction Goes " Prime " Time

Beginning in September , English will become a compulsory subject for primary school students in grades 5 and 6 .
In fact , choruses of " bo - po - mo " and " A - B - C " have been recited in primary school classrooms for a long time now .
Many parents begin sending their children to " bilingual " kindergartens , or to private English schools long before , hoping to provide them with an English - speaking environment from an early age to prepare them to compete in modern society .
The whole world seems to be learning English .
Is Taiwan getting on the bandwagon too late ?
And what kind of developments have taken place in English language teaching methodology , from private language schools to the education system itself ?
For students in grades 1 and 2 , school should finish at midday , but at Chunghsing Primary School in Hsimen District , the grade 2 students are performing an abridged English language version of the play " Cinderella . "
Their teacher , Shen , says the line " My Prince Charming ! " and the young girl playing the part of Cinderella , repeats it after her word for word .
Then the young boy playing the prince replies " You are beautiful ! "
Their audience of classmates breaks into laughter .
After this , the class plays ' Teacher Says . '
Speaking in English the teacher tells the children to do various actions :
stand up , sit down , touch your hair , touch your nose ... .
Anyone who gets the action wrong is out .
In today 's English lesson , a grade 4 class at Jen Ai Primary School is starting sentences with ' I can . '
The teacher explains the basic pattern then the class begins a game of charades .
Children mime movements at the front of the class : swimming , dancing , jumping , running etc , and their classmates have to use English to describe what they 're doing .
Next is story telling time ; today 's story is about a child who just ca n't stop sneezing .
What is he so sensitive to ?
Is it dust ?
a plant ?
perfume ?
pepper ?
the story finishes as the bell sounds to end the lesson .
Forty minutes have passed in the blink of an eye .
After 4 pm students wearing the uniforms of Jen Ai , Tunhua , and Chien An primary schools stream into a private English school in a lane off Tunhua South Road .
In one classroom seven or eight students look at phonetic symbols on the blackboard and repeat the words after their teacher in a loud chorus , learning the relationship between the phonetic symbols and the letters .
Putting down roots
Just how widespread is this English learning among our primary students ?
Mr. Chen lives in Neihu .
Four years earlier his daughter , now in grade 3 , attended English classes at a well known private kindergarten in Neihu .
Every evening just on dusk the kindergarten 's minibus would pick up his daughter and take her away to spend two happy hours each day in a " totally American " language environment .
" If your English is good , it gives you an edge .
It 's essential , " says Chen .
" I grew up in a rural area , and never had an environment like this .
When I made my way into the wider world , I was on the back foot compared to people with good English . "
He wants his children to be better prepared for life than he was , so like the children of many of his friends and relatives , they began learning English in kindergarten .
" As long as we can find the money , at least they wo n't be left behind at the starting line . "
Even though the fees for his two children to attend a bilingual kindergarten came to NT$ 80,000 for just one term , Chen considers it " money well spent . "
Mrs. Liu , a mother living on Minsheng East Road recalls some years ago , before English teaching in primary schools started in earnest .
Her daughter , then in grade 3 , started attending a private English school .
She really enjoyed it and she found she was able to listen to English language educational programs on the radio all by herself .
" English is definitely an international language , and it 's become indispensable for getting by in the world - like being able to use a computer .
You simply ca n't find work without it . "
These days learning English is part and parcel of a primary student 's life , unlike their parents who first met " A , B , C ... " when they began high school .
Following on research done by Chu Hui - mei , head of the English Department at the Taipei Municipal Teachers College , in September , 1997 , Taipei City selected 19 primary schools to pilot a grade 3 English program .
Together with schools not participating in this pilot program , by the end of 1997 there were already 112 primary schools in Taipei City teaching English -LRB- 75 % of the total -RRB- .
That same year , Kaohsiung City selected 77 primary schools to implement a comprehensive English language program for grades 5 and 6 , while in other areas , such as Taipei County , Ilan County and Yunlin County , the Bureau of Education was giving more urgency to the promotion of English in primary schools .
English language teaching in primary schools is a key plank in a range of curriculum reforms to take us into the new century .
As early as 1996 , the Educational Reform Committee of the Executive Yuan proposed that the Ministry of Education include English in the primary school curriculum .
After taking office the former Minister for Education , Wu Ching , put forward the idea of a " nine - year integrated curriculum " encompassing primary and secondary education .
In 1998 , the President of the Academia Sinica , Lee Yuan - tseh , indicated to a meeting of the Science and Technology Committee of the Executive Yuan that because English had been taught in Taiwan as a " discipline " rather than as a " communication tool , " Taiwanese who went to study overseas found they were unable to read what their professors had prescribed in the time available .
Morris Chang , chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation , echoed these sentiments , pointing out that compared with Hong Kong and Singapore , the English competency of our high school and tertiary graduates is inadequate for any practical use .
This is affecting Taiwan 's access to information and acting as a barrier to increasing our productivity .
When he was premier , Vincent Siew agreed in principle to introducing English instruction in the earlier years of schooling .
Situational ABC
In actual fact , English for children was already popular all over Taiwan even before these moves .
In 1997 associate professor Chang Hsien - ta of the National Taiwan University Linguistics Research Institute investigated whether or not a " second language " was being taught in public and privately run kindergartens in Taipei City and County , and Hsinchu City and County , and found that 79 % were doing so .
In these kindergartens English was by far the most popular second language , being taught in 77.5 % .
In Taipei City the figure was 90 % .
In the current climate of almost unanimous community support for the expansion of English teaching into early education , the primary schools of Taipei City with its rich resources , were the first to pilot this , but the investment of the parents has also been crucial .
Huang Yuan - tai , an administrator at Chunghsing Primary School gives an example :
four years ago a parent who had worked in America approached the school , saying that at home they often told their children stories in English , and they wanted the other children to enjoy similar benefits .
The school responded positively and for the next two years , gathered students in the middle and elementary grades together in a large group in the school hall each morning in their study hour , and conducted a program .
Two years ago , realizing that the local parents had to work in the daytime , the school began holding supplementary after - school classes offering English lessons every Wednesday afternoon for the elementary grades .
" The parents are delighted .
They think it 's far better for their children to be here improving their English than sitting at home in front of a TV . "
The current model is very different to how English used to be taught in secondary schools , which was " first learn to read and write , then learn to speak . "
English lessons for children emphasize situations , fun , and practice .
" We 're basically creating the same environment for our children as an American preschooler would have , " says Shen Hui - lien , a teacher at Chunghsing Primary School .
On Wednesday afternoons she speaks only English with the children .
They must ask " May I go to the bathroom ? "
to get her permission to leave the room when the need arises .
" Children in these earliest grades are soak up everything like a sponge .
This is the ideal time to establish their listening comprehension and pronunciation . "
Jen Ai Primary School has over 100 classes .
Eight years ago it was approached by a parent offering to come to the school to teach the students some English songs and tell some English stories .
A few years ago , the school began allowing grades 1 to 6 to turn on the TV sets in their classrooms every morning between 8:00 and 8:15 , and watch simple English dialogue videos produced by their teachers .
Big classes , little practice
What strikes people as curious is , if their schools have had English classes for a long time now then why do so many students need to go to private language schools ?
Chen Chien - hao , another teacher at Jen Ai Primary School , says that at least two - thirds of his more than 600 students are getting extra English lessons outside school .
" If they were n't doing this extra work , they 'd never be able to keep up after entering junior high school . "
According to Mrs. Su , a mother living in Tanshui , many junior high schools include English listening comprehension tests in the entrance examinations and if primary school students do n't improve their skills then they simply wo n't make the grade .
In her family the problem is that her son began learning English when he was four , and so when he went to primary school , the English lessons were just too simple for him .
And you really need small class sizes for the training of listening comprehension , and this is another thing the schools can not provide .
So the only thing to do is keep on sending him to the private language school , where classes are more ideally sized .
Another mother , Mrs. Chang , who lives on Chunghsiao East Road , recalls what happened a year earlier when her son 's school began teaching English .
From the very beginning the teacher only spoke English and her son suffered a lot of setbacks .
" He just could n't understand a thing his teacher was saying , and he asked if he could go to a private English school . "
She could n't see any other choice and agreed to let him enroll at one nearby .
The Taipei City Government Bureau of Education invited experts to form a working team to visit primary schools and inspect their English instruction programs .
It found that for the majority of teachers , the greatest difficulty is the vast range of English levels of the students in a single class .
Some have been learning English since very young and find class too easy , and so when the lesson starts their enthusiasm evaporates .
For other students meeting English for the first time , however , the lessons are hard going .
Added to this is the perennial problem of class sizes being too large , and not enough English classes scheduled - only one or two a week .
It 's extremely difficult to correct pronunciation problems , or to achieve any educational goals at all , under these conditions .
The parents have a number of concerns .
If the teachers only speak English in class it will frighten children who have never learnt English before .
Some teachers teach too quickly and some of their students ca n't keep up , so all parents can do is send their kids to private language schools .
Singing and jumping around are not really suitable for the senior grades , and parents hope that teachers will keep in mind the different needs of different age groups .
Parents and teachers both raised the idea of " ability streaming , " i.e. , different classes for different ability levels , to address the difficulties of large classes .
Educators , however , have many reservations .
Chu Hui - mei explains , " Every Chinese family is preoccupied with being able to get ahead in the world , but our past experience with ability - based class groupings has taught us some bitter lessons . "
When students are grouped on the basis of ability , some parents get upset when their children are placed in a lower level group , which makes them lose face .
It can also affect the children 's confidence .
" We have large numbers of students .
People need to think about what resources the schools have , and whether they could help in some way . "
She suggests that schools can organize English Clubs for the more advanced students , and their teachers can provide them with interesting story books which are more demanding .
This way , they 'll feel that the teacher is giving them some attention , and that their needs are also being catered for .
" Private language schools fill a need for small - group learning . "
Professor Chang Hsien - ta recommends that teachers use " co-operative learning " methods .
For example , divide a large class into groups to discuss what they would buy with NT$ 100 .
The more advanced students can lead the discussion , which gives them a sense of participation .
But this kind of activity may not succeed the first few times - it takes time to get used to group learning .
With regard to the problems of having too few classes a week and learning very little English , the working group suggested that schools could take advantage of times such as early - morning study hour , cleaning time , and the lunch break to play tapes or practise speaking English , to give students more exposure to English .
Fewer foreign teachers
In the past , English teaching placed too much emphasis on reading and writing , whereas now for most primary school students , " learning to understand and speak is foremost , reading and writing is secondary . "
Nevertheless many people have reservations about the pronunciation of the English teachers in our primary schools .
Private language schools also seem aware of this , and many prominently advertise the fact that they employ foreign teachers .
But do the foreign teachers really teach more effectively than our local teachers ?
" Many people put the root of the problems they had learning English down to not being able to speak . "
Chu Hui - mei says that while there are differences it 's difficult to say whether foreign or local teachers are better .
Native speakers of English " may not understand what it 's like for someone learning English as a foreign language and the kinds of problems they face . "
Chu Hui - mei took part in the inspection visits to primary schools , and foung that local teachers understand the children 's way of thinking and have a much better grasp of the course .
Foreign teachers ' strengths lie in dialogue and accurate pronunciation .
Besides , " We ca n't put the whole responsibility of English language teaching onto foreign teachers . "
Several years ago when there was a shortage of English teachers in the primary schools , many schools employed foreign teachers on an hourly basis , or made staff sharing arrangements with private language schools .
But these were stopgap measures .
The Ministry of Education has already drawn up a whole range of plans for teacher training .
These include establishing English Teaching Departments at teacher training colleges and supplementary education courses at tertiary institutions , allowing graduates who intend to become English teachers in primary schools to obtain official teaching qualifications , and providing further training for qualified teachers who have never taught English , to equip them with appropriate language teaching skills and methods .
The primary school English train has already left the station .
What can we look forward to ?
Yutsai Primary School in Taipei County did a survey of how parents felt about the primary English teaching program .
It found that 52 % thought that the goal was to stimulate the students ' interest in learning English , and 45 % thought it was to establish a solid grounding in English for the children while they were still young .
Professor Chang Hsien - ta says that given the expansion of English teaching into the primary schools , we can not allow a great gap to open between what 's happening in the primary and the secondary schools .
Primary schools include a lot of games and activities in their English teaching , and while this is very lively , if all it amounts to is a lot of jumping around and loud pronunciation practice , the children may get a quite incorrect idea of what English is all about .
When the day comes that they go to high school , and they have to settle down and read an essay , they could well find that really boring .
" Listening , speaking , reading and writing all have their place .
None should be overemphasized at the expense of the others . "
" The way children learn English now wo n't be the same as it was for us .
Resources have improved tremendously , and how things are done has changed along with the environment .
The younger the students , the more essential it is to pay very serious attention to course standards , " says Chu Hui - mei .
The current educational mantra is " student centered learning , " and the teacher 's role is extremely important .
According to her understanding , more than 80 % of the primary school teachers in Taipei City are outstanding .
" What we envisage as a reasonable target is for the children to learn to hear and understand - and be able to say - 200 words after two years . "
She wants the children to understand how to use the words , to be willing to use them , and to use them whenever the opportunity arises .
She also hopes that they will get a lot of pleasure from reading English storybooks .
" The primary English program is not a subject like mathematics or Chinese .
It 's something new and it 's still finding its place in the curriculum , " says Chen Chien - hao , from Jen Ai Primary School .
As he sees it , the children must not feel that learning English is putting them under a lot of pressure .
If they can see a word and read it aloud , that 's fine .
They can leave memorizing word lists until they get to high school .
Children come into contact with English all the time .
They can learn from The Little English Whiz on television , or read the children 's English language magazine EZ Talk .
Let 's hope they 'll feel completely at ease speaking English and enjoy the learning process .

It 's the " Knowledge - Based " Economy , Stupid !
-LRB- Laura Li / photos by Jimmy Lin / tr. by Phil Newell -RRB-
A saying has it that " knowledge is power . "
But here at the turn of the century , people are discovering that knowledge is more than just power ; it is also profit .
Responding to the new realities , the Executive Yuan has put forward a plan to develop Taiwan 's " knowledge - based economy " which aims to double per capita income within ten years .
This plan embraces the long-term economic goals of the new administration .
But what is covered under the rubric of developing the knowledge - based economy ?
What conditions are required to be successful ?
Does Taiwan meet these criteria ?
Did you know that 90 % of the knowledge in the world has been produced in the half century since the end of World War II ?
And in 20 years , what we know today will be only one percent of the total knowledge bank of our children !
" It is estimated that the pool of human knowledge doubled once every fifty years in the 19th century , and about once every ten years in the 20th century .
Now it doubles once every three to five years , " notes Wu Se-hwa , dean of the business school at National Chengchi University .
The explosive growth of information is the most distinctive feature of the 20th century , and has brought sweeping changes to the world 's political , social , and economic structure .
Profit defines value
In 1992 , shortly after US president Bill Clinton took office , he declared that emphasis should be placed on research and development and on creating a " new economy . "
It turns out that these last eight years in the US have been a golden age of high economic growth , falling unemployment , and stable prices .
In 1996 , the OECD coined the term " knowledge - based economy , " and many governments have jumped on the bandwagon since .
You can call it the " new economy " or the " knowledge - based economy " or whatever , but what is it really ?
How can such an economy be created ?
Because each country has different development needs , there are many different answers to these questions .
Wu Se-hwa points out that the term " knowledge - based economy " refers to any economic activity based on the production or application of knowledge , in which " knowledge " includes all kinds of technology , patents , management know-how , and individual creations .
It is not important how profound or esoteric the knowledge may be ; what matters most is turning that knowledge into a product which can earn a profit .
Looking back at the economic history of the West , in 16th century society , agricultural products were the key to wealth and power .
Whoever had the most , and most fertile , land was in a dominant position .
In the industrial age , capitalists who commanded the wealth to buy machinery and hire workers , or who owned critical resources like coal and oil , replaced landowners as the dominant figures in the economy .
But today , whoever owns systematized knowledge will win out over his or her competitors .
When Lester Thurow , the well - known economist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , came to Taiwan to give a lecture a half year ago , he pointed to the Microsoft Corporation as a prime example : Microsoft owns no farmland , no oil fields , no expensive and sophisticated factories , and no shops of its own .
Its product fits onto a tiny microchip .
Yet this company , relying only on the brainpower of several thousand engineers sitting in front of computers writing programs , has earned billions upon billions of dollars for owner Bill Gates .
It is estimated that 300 million persons use Microsoft Windows each day around the world , with annual revenues reaching US$ 25 billion .
Knowledge petrie dish
In the past , Chinese people discovered much knowledge and invented much technology , but , influenced by the Confucian belief that profit was not a worthy application of wisdom , never converted these into commercial products .
But in the face of today 's dramatic global economic transformation , there is no choice but to try to turn knowledge into profit .
And the thing that links knowledge with profit is information technology -LRB- IT -RRB- .
Hsu Wen-hsing , founder of Smartek Engineering , whose company has twice won national awards in Taiwan for its fingerprint verification device , says that human history can be seen as the history of information .
When Marco Polo visited the East in the 13th century , if he had not left a written account of his travels , it would have been a virtually wasted trip .
The recent enthusiasm for the Taipei exhibition of terracotta warriors from Xi'an is due to the fact that these long - buried figures contain information about mysteries dating back 2000 years .
Hsu Wen-hsing points out that in the past information was always tied to material objects , and remained in the hands of the few .
When the material objects disappeared , so did the information they contained .
But now , thanks to IT , for the first time in history information can be forever stored in huge volume , ready and waiting to be manipulated , exchanged , and even sent across great distances .
IT is like a petrie dish .
Information cells swim around in it , and can divide , recombine , reproduce , and copy themselves without limit , opening up entirely new possibilities for the accumulation and application of knowledge .
For example , computers are capable of finding numbers hidden under or scattered throughout a huge pile of data which is impenetrable to the human brain , and can analyze and clarify these numbers into useful know-how .
" One order form is not information .
But , by using a computer to save , connect , and search individual order forms , one can draw a thread through tens of thousands of them , and discern their regularities and variations .
Now that 's knowledge , " declares Simon Chang , president of Acer CyberCenter Services .
At a glance you can find information such as regional and seasonal variations in sales , or market acceptance of a given product .
And if there is a problem , it can be identified immediately , avoiding guesswork and wasted time .
Everyone a multibillionaire !
In the information world , everyone is equal .
Though huge multinational corporations may have an edge in terms of information technology , since the rapid growth of the Internet in the 1990s , ' little guys ' whom no one has ever heard of before - relying only on programming ability , creativity , and hard work - have had the space to bring their talents into play .
The best - known example is Yahoo , the world 's number one web portal .
It all started with two Stanford PhD students looking for a way to categorize the websites online , who came up with a great idea for a way to make finding information easier for Internet users .
With this idea , after six years of hard work , today Yahoo has a market value of US$ 50 billion .
Over the past five years profits have grown at a rate of 9800 % , which has got to be some kind of record .
However , though knowledge may be profitable , its value is subject to severe fluctuation .
George Tsao , assistant vice president of the Knowledge Management Center at Winbond Electronics Corporation , notes that in the past you could determine the worth of a company by adding up its fixed assets -LRB- such as land and factories -RRB- and liquid assets -LRB- such as cash -RRB- , with each calculable down to the last penny .
But knowledge is intangible .
Two different software packages burned onto identical chips can have grossly different values .
Sometimes it all depends on luck or fads .
The dramatic rise and fall of US software stocks this past year reflects the difficulty of assessing the value of knowledge .
Wu Se-hwa points to Intel as a prime example of how knowledge can " convert silicon to gold . "
A name - card sized CPU is in fact just a chipboard with complicated circuitry , with a unit cost of less than US$ 35 .
But because it includes unique information that makes the computer run , and carries the authority of " Intel inside , " it can fetch over US$ 1000 in the marketplace , many times the cost of production .
What about Taiwan ?
Clearly there is already a global trend in which an information economy is taking shape .
What advantages does Taiwan have for playing a larger role in this realm ?
Simon Chang , who left the job of director of planning at the National Science Council only six months ago to enter the private sector , points out that the knowledge - based economy basically deals in information technology , and the IT industry is the most profitable region in the emerging geography of the knowledge - based economy .
Taiwan currently ranks fourth in the world in value of IT production , and , if you include the plants established by Taiwan investors across the globe , Taiwanese - controlled firms lead the world in manufacturing of IT hardware .
In other words , Taiwan has a solid manufacturing base and a large pool of high quality human resources on which it can rely to develop the knowledge - based economy .
Also , Taiwan has a strong education system .
The results of a recent international survey measuring the performance of junior high school students in natural sciences and math show that Taiwan kids finished first in the former and third -LRB- behind only Singapore and Korea -RRB- in the latter .
Alice Chang , CEO of CyberLink Corporation , whose firm has become a much - coveted new entry in the stock market and has drawn international attention with audio-visual software like Power DVD and Talking Show , says : " Talented people are at the root of knowledge . "
AV software is very difficult to produce , and staff must have a solid grounding in math .
This is where Taiwan is at an advantage .
However , though Taiwan has its strong points , there are also a number of problems and shortcomings .
" The first thing to consider , says Wu Se-hwa , " is this :
What kind of knowledge - based economy is Taiwan most suited to ? "
Wu says that right now what the government is focusing on and what stock market players most hope for is a US - style " new economy . "
The focus is on new industries , such as software and the Internet , or communications technology , fiber - optics , biotechnology , and the like .
But can the American model be reproduced in Taiwan ?
There is little reason to be optimistic .
The new economy in the US depends heavily , for one thing , on a deep foundation of basic scientific research , which comes up with revolutionary products like genetically modified foods .
Another key factor is that the US has a mechanism for innovation and entrepreneurship , so that new ideas have a chance to be brought into play .
The rapid growth in the new economy has driven a decade - long economic boom in the States .
The old manufacturing economy has naturally been trimmed back , with factories relocating overseas , but American firms can depend on the rights to technology to earn a profit .
Pearl Tan , public relations manager at Applied Materials Taiwan , a subsidiary of the giant US semiconductor equipment manufacturer of the same name , points to a prime example : DRAM , the hottest industry in Taiwan , which was a monopoly of the US firm Texas Instruments .
Tan notes that although DRAM factories are closing one after another in the US , patent royalties must still be paid to Texas Instruments for each and every one of the more than 100 million DRAMs produced around the world annually .
This is a classic " knowledge goose that lays golden eggs . "
The new economy is a weapon by which the US dominates the world , with " the export of knowledge " replacing the export of goods .
Yet , in the entire world , only the US , Japan , and the UK export more technology than they import .
In other words , only these three countries have a surplus in " knowledge trade , " and can make money by selling knowledge .
Of these three , US income from selling technology is four times the amount it spends buying technology elsewhere , and it earns enough each year in patent royalties to balance its enormous deficit in manufactured goods .
In contrast , Taiwan is still showing a nasty deficit in knowledge trade , with money going out twice as fast as it is coming in .
The impressive American model would certainly be difficult to apply to the small " shallow " economy in Taiwan .
As Ko Chen-en , dean of the College of Management at National Taiwan University , puts it : " You merely have to ask how many Nobel Prize winners Taiwan has - not many - and you know its real ability to follow the US economic model . "
Ko relates that " high-risk and high-profit " revolutionary new technologies can normally only be created with enormous financial backing .
In 1999 , total expenditures on R&D in Taiwan by both the government and private sector were a mere NT$ 200 billion -LRB- about US $ 6 billion -RRB- , less than was spent by IBM alone .
Slow improvement
In contrast to the " picking stars from the sky " US model , says Wu Se-hwa , " the European knowledge - based economy concept is closer to what Taiwan needs . "
As Wu explains , the OECD definition of the knowledge - based economy embraces all kinds of industries , from Italian shoes to Dutch flowers .
Any industry that increases its knowledge component , using knowledge to improve management , innovate , or improve quality , can be considered a knowledge industry .
This is a much more practical ambition for Taiwan , which has a high proportion of traditional industry and is extremely dependent on OEM manufacturing to make money .
In 1998 Taiwan had more than 4500 patents approved in the US , ranking fourth .
But not many of these were for original discoveries ; most were in the category of improvements of old ideas , mainly ways to increase efficiency in the manufacturing process .
Innovations that are improvements require less money for R&D , and do not require genius-like creativity , but can be made primarily by devoting more attention to a specific problem .
S.T. Day , chairman of the National Association of Small and Medium Enterprises of the ROC , and chairman of the San Sun Hat and Cap Company , takes the following case in point : On most caps there is an " eyelet " in the stitching .
But , because of different machine designs , the gap can be 80 , 90 , or 100 stitches , creating problems for quality control .
San Sun created a computer program that ensures that machines leave a uniform gap of 95 stitches , and even gets the machines to tie a lovely knot when the sticthcing is completed .
This seemingly small improvement actually allows the firm to charge double the unit price per hat .
Day has factories in Taiwan , the US , mainland China , and Dominica .
Wages in Taiwan are 15 times greater than in the PRC , and 100 times greater than in Burma .
" If Taiwan workers just make hats and do nothing else , then it does n't pay .
But if , because of their higher quality , these workers come up with their own ideas for improving the production process , then they are worth it , " says Day with the voice of experience .
He says that in assessing the value of employees , you have to look at more than just the value of the product ; you have to also take into account its " intelligence " value .
San Sun insists it will not lay off any Taiwan workers , nor will it hire foreign laborers in Taiwan , and its sales have not suffered as a result .
Indeed , orders through October of 2000 showed an increase of 60 % over the previous year .
VIA con dios
VIA Technologies , a stock market powerhouse in Taiwan which has made a tremendous impact in the chipset market these past two years , and which is even threatening the dominant position of Intel , has adopted a different strategy for gradually expanding its territory .
William Lee , who works in public relations at VIA , says that the production of chipsets is a high risk activity .
So , taking advantage of the boom in the Taiwan stock market over the past two years , the company went on a binge of hiring , acquisitions , and strategic alliances , expanding in size rapidly .
Lee says that in the past , VIA 's chipsets were designed completely to support Intel specification CPUs .
In 1998 , when Intel insisted on sticking with expensive Rambus memory chips despite a poor market response , VIA saw its opportunity :
It began promoting use of the P133 memory chip , which had been created by an international consortium and was provided to factories free of charge .
For the first time , VIA had challenged the " big boss , " Intel .
In the latter half of 1999 , VIA acquired two CPU companies in the States , giving it an independent ability to develop CPUs .
In addition , half a year ago it entered into cooperation with the US graphics powerhouse S3 to make graphics chips .
In these ways , VIA is moving step by step to enlarge its intellectual holdings .
" You have to have a lot of technology already on hand before you can start talking about systematic integration and trying out major innovations , " says Lee .
It is only now that VIA can escape from the specifications dictated by large multinational firms , and create innovative products of its own .
To meet future market demand for home appliances that are inexpensive , multi-functional , and portable , the main direction will be to get all the functions on to a single chip .
VIA has designed a new 3 - in - 1 chipset which includes CPU , memory , and graphics , which are expected to formally hit the market in the first half of 2001 .
As Lee reveals : " No one has ever done this before .
We are trying something new . "
Save the idiots !
Nonetheless , knowledge and creativity are intangible , and it is not always easy to determine ownership .
This is especially problematic in Taiwan , where some people still do n't have a very clear idea about intellectual property rights , and legal protections are less than comprehensive .
This is a potential problem for the development of the knowledge - based economy in Taiwan .
" Many innovations just represent going a little bit further in thinking about a problem than the other guys , and once the secret is uncovered , it is easy for them to copy the idea , " says Simon Chang .
The most famous example in the industry involves a certain company that wanted to create information systems like storage and document handling .
It invited a number of information industry firms to give briefings on their products .
After a while , this former " outsider " became an insider , and created its own product , congratulating itself on saving so much money in the process .
Simon Chang notes that a major innovation usually is nested in a lot of small innovations .
If small innovations are not recognized , or do not get appropriate market rewards , this will destroy the motivation to innovate at all .
This is precisely the problem now being faced by Comdek , the first company in Taiwan to produce medical instruments such as blood - oxygen monitors and ear thermometers .
Michael Y.S. Kuo , general manager at Comdek , points out that the quick and easy process of taking body temperature through the ear was developed by an American company , and the German giant Boehringer-Ingelheim paid a huge amount of money for the patent so they could begin production .
Comdek took the basic principle , and went to work on it , eventually coming up with their own version , for which they have been awarded a patent .
But when Comdek 's product came out , Michael Kuo still found himself in a vicious struggle with Taiwan pirate firms : " It 's equivalent to making fools out of those of us who invest the money to do research and development ! "
Kuo says that while there has been some improvement in Taiwan with regard to protection of intellectual property rights , there is still not enough for those who invest in development and innovation .
Comdek has closed its laboratory and production line to any outside visits , and has not ruled out the possibility of moving its lab overseas to get away from industrial espionage in Taiwan .
Looking for a Taiwan McDonald 's
Espionage reflects a lack of respect for knowledge .
But there is also the problem of insufficient awareness of the potential value of knowledge , so that , as Wu Se-hwa says , Taiwan firms " are sitting on a mountain of gold , but do n't know that they can sell what they know for hard cash . "
" The most ' classic ' form of knowledge product is one in which the intangible value of the knowledge transcends the tangible value of the product , and can be reproduced in large volume at low cost , thus earning huge profits . "
Wu points to the US coffee shop chain Starbucks .
Can they really make huge profits just by selling cups of coffee for a couple of bucks ?
Of course not .
The headquarters company in fact spends most of its time handling the sale of franchise rights worldwide .
What Starbucks sells is not coffee , but " the knowledge of how to run a coffee shop . "
The same logic applies to McDonalds :
Who does n't know how to draw their " golden arches " trademark ?
It does n't seem to require any great wisdom to have a bright and clean store with fast - food service , but when you link this simple product together with a trademark , powerful name recognition , and high quality control , the result has swept the globe .
Now over 20,000 franchises worldwide work to expand the company 's territory while the headquarters takes 0.5 % of operating revenues as its share for as long as the franchise lasts .
In recent years , as Taiwan firms have increasingly invested abroad , the " Taiwan experience " has penetrated deeply into Southeast Asia and mainland China .
In both the manufacturing and service sectors , Taiwan businessmen have proven adept at flexibly adapting to local society .
But now that Taiwan methods are well understood and widely copied , Taiwan investors are being dropped by their local partners .
" Taiwan companies do n't understand how to ensure their earnings from management knowledge and company name recognition , and are not in the habit of selling rights or earning royalties , " says Wu with regret , as he offers the following examples : Taiwan department stores are a cut above PRC state - run stores , Taiwan 's construction industry has the knack for systematic management , and even industries like eel - raising have their own technologies and operating methods , but people only think about keeping these secrets to themselves and making money by working on their own .
They do n't know how to spread knowledge so that others will make money for them !
Of course , to sell operational know-how , this knowledge must be converted into steps , systems , and standards , and must be well - packaged .
And trademarks and patents must be employed to deter potential pirates .
Wu suggests that organizations in Taiwan which are dedicated to teaching management methods , such as the China Productivity Center , should assist companies in systematizing and selling the rights to their mangement and operating philosophies , so that the uniquely flexible Taiwan approach to business can be reproduced and marketed worldwide .
" If only people would change their attitudes , the knowledge - based economy could have many new components , and every industry , firm , or individual could find an opportunity to make money on this new frontier , "
concludes Wu .
Looking to the future , the road to a knowledge - based economy is long , but it is the only choice for Taiwan .
What is most important now is to remove obstacles from the path , and to make each stride as large and quick as possible .

A Southeast Asian Singing Star Shines in Taiwan -- Sun Yan Zi
-LRB- Eric Lin / tr. by Jonathan Barnard -RRB-
In the year 2000 a singer in Taiwan re-leased her debut album in the middle of the year and has been hot ever since .
She 's the music market 's darling for the start of the century .
Her first album hit number one on the best seller list of Rose Records , a major retail chain .
Then in December sales of her second album constituted one - quarter of all sales in the pop category .
With this share , she surpassed even A - Mei , the reigning queen of Taiwan pop .
In January three of the top ten requested songs at Cashbox KTV were her songs .
And both the entertainment weekly put out by the China Times and the music video station Channel V selected her as last year 's " best newcomer . "
Sun Yan Zi , this 23 - year - old from Singapore has n't been here a full year , but her efforts are already bearing ample fruit .
What exactly are her charms ?
And Does her success show that singers from Southeast Asia have successfully established a foothold in Taiwan ?
" When I threw temper tantrums /
As a young girl /
On summer afternoons /
My grandmother would soothe me /
By gently singing an old song /
It went like this /
The sky is dark /
It 's going to rain /
The sky is dark ...
Are there always hidden flaws in the grown - up world ? /
Every day I come to forks in the road
...
How lonely I 've become ! /
When skies are dark /
I recall that song /
And hope to hear the peaceful sound of the falling rain /
It turns out that Grandma sang this song long ago /
The rain is falling /
but I 've got to boldly push ahead . "
" Dark Skies , " Sun 's first hit last June , caused an immediate sensation .
The critic G Moon praised it as a marvelous blend of seemingly familiar melody and lyrics , with solo piano accompaniment from start to finish .
People found Sun 's singing voice fresh , clean and infectiously charming , and it quickly earned her a place in Taiwan 's music world .
Fresh and clean
Sun clearly occupies an enviable position in the singing world .
Yet it is hard to pin down exactly where that position is .
Although she has written a few songs herself , these are not among her better works , so she can not be properly placed among the " singer - songwriters . "
And while her voice sets her apart , she has not perfected her live performance skills , so she can not be included among the true divas .
Moreover , her short hair , buck teeth and aversion to wearing skirts and dresses would seem to exclude her from the teeny - bopper " idols . "
Finally , she ca n't be considered an innovator .
Half her songs are slow and half are fast , and she has n't revealed much desire to experiment .
Indeed , Internet bulletin boards are full of posts wondering why exactly Sun Yan Zi is so popular .
" How did she get so popular overnight ?
Her looks and voice are pretty average . "
" She 's not beautiful , but her smile and singing voice are pleasing .
She makes people feel comfortable . "
" She does n't really have any special quality to speak of , which seems to be the case with most of the Southeast Asian singers . "
Peter Li , the Singaporean who produced both Sun Yan Zi and My Desire Happiness for Sun , admits that she was n't an outstanding student at his music academy , and that her rapid success has surprised many people .
But he conjectures that the freshness and intimacy that she projects may be responsible for her success .
Citing " freshness , " The China Times entertainment weekly awarded their prize for " best newcomer " to Sun , " the girl with the boyish haircut . "
Their panel of judges remarked , " She has good range without the frenzied style that characterizes so many .
Her fast songs have a fresh style , and her slow songs convey a soft melancholy . "
Wang Tzu - shou , a senior reporter at Min Sheng Pao , describes her as the new generation 's Feng Fei - fei .
" When the market gets tired of soft and pretty idols , it swings back toward androgynous tomboy types like Feng Fei - fei , " Wang notes .
" Sun Yan Zi fills this need perfectly . "
Moreover , she has had the right material , with producer Peter Li providing songs that have individual character but stop short of being avant garde .
This has allowed her to stand apart from the pop singers who just blindly follow the marketplace .
Hence , though she is neither a singer - songwriter , nor an outstanding vocalist , nor a conventional teen idol , she has nevertheless been able to attain brilliant success in an era where premiums are placed on both " changing constantly " and " returning to the basics . "
Talent exchange
In a weak market for recorded music , Sun 's two albums have sold very well .
Members of the media have quipped that those who work at Taiwan 's Warner Music can thank two Singaporeans , Sun and her producer Li , for any bonuses they made last year .
Now people have started wondering if overseas Chinese from Southeast Asia - and in particular from Singapore and Malaysia - are taking over the mainstream of the Taiwanese music industry .
In earlier decades Southeast Asian singers were unusual here .
In the 1970s and 1980s there was Teng Miao - hua and Wen Chang .
Then Eric Moo appeared on the scene in the 1990s .
Although these were all successful singers , they comprised a small group .
But in the last five years or so , there has been a steady stream of Southeast Asian singers making their mark in Taiwan : Mavis Hee , Mindy , Kit Chan , Tanya Chua , Michael and Victor , Angelica Lee , Penny , Fish Leong , and Tae Kheng Seong .
Interestingly , almost all of them have been described as being " fresh and clean . "
Moreover , even those who write their own material , such as Tanya Chua , Michael and Victor , and Tae Kheng Seong , write simple folk songs .
Although the Southeast Asians have n't had quite the impact of the returning overseas Chinese from North America , they have staked out their piece of the pop music field .
Music critic Tsai Yun - pu notes that the Southeast Asian singers are not as recognizable as their counterparts from North America , who have a hard - rocking , R&B style .
The simple and catchy melodies and rhythms of the Southeast Asians sound a lot like those of the locals .
Taiwanese listeners quickly identify with these singers and may even forget where they come from .
" Taiwan is now the capital of Mandarin pop music worldwide , " says Tsai .
" If there 's a ' capital , ' then there are ' provinces . ' "
The market is too small in Southeast Asia , so it has become de rigueur for Southeast Asian Chinese singers to come to Taiwan to advance their careers .
Those with talent are quickly adopted by local audiences . "
Wang Tzu - hsien argues that the growing dominance of multi-national companies in the Taiwanese music field has fostered uniformity here , and the Southeast Asians have been able to step in and fill the need for greater creativity .
Yet though their music may be " fresher , " on close inspection it does n't really differ that much from what is produced by the locals .
It is , after all , produced for the same market .
Although there may not be much that sets the Southeast Asians apart , the growing exchange of musical talent between Taiwan and Southeast Asia has at least provided ample content for the gossip pages .
When Sun wore a long jacket while shooting a music video , people could tell how excited she was at wearing a winter coat for the first time .
At that moment , Taiwan did n't seem to be that far from Singapore , despite the latter 's endless summer weather .
We all could sense a young woman 's joy at being accepted in foreign land that seemed at once familiar and exotic .

Asian Values vs. Children 's Rights
-LRB- Chang Chiung - fang / photos by Pu Hua - chih / tr. by Christopher MacDonald -RRB-
A schoolchild writes : " When I grow up I want to be a clown " in his exercise book .
If his teacher is Chinese , the probable response is : " No ambition !
Hardly worth teaching ! "
But with a Western teacher , it 's more likely to be : " Go on and fill the world with laughter ! "
In Chinese society it has been traditional to place demands on children rather than give them encouragement , and the idea of what constitutes " success " has been fairly narrowly defined .
Yet Chinese / Asian values have been much extolled in the West in the past few years .
Is the concept of children 's rights , and human rights as a whole , really incompatible with so - called " Asian values " ?
As members of the global village in the 21st century , what route should we follow ?
It was former Singapore premier Lee Kuan Yew who first raised the banner of " Asian Values . "
In 1992 Lee said in an interview : " For East Asian countries like Japan , Korea , Taiwan , Hong Kong and Singapore , group values and behavior have been extremely helpful in the process of ' catching up ' economically .
East Asian values , such as the need to sacrifice individual interests in pursuit of the group interest , have been a major impetus for the region 's rapid development . "
Group society
According to one survey , Asians are more likely than Americans to regard such things as " close family relations , " " an orderly society , " " respect for knowledge " and " maintaining group harmony " as important values .
At the United Nations World Human Rights Convention , China 's delegate responded to the West 's frequent criticisms of China 's human rights record in the following terms : " The concept of human rights is a legacy of historical development , and is connected with a country 's specific social and economic situation , as well as its history , culture and values .
There are different human rights requirements at different stages of historical development .
Countries at different phases of development , or with different historical traditions and cultural background , understand and deal with human rights in different ways , so the human rights standards of one country can not be uniformly applied around the world , in the expectation that other countries will act in line with those standards .
From obligations to rights
From the viewpoint of East Asian societies , the West tends to over-emphasize freedom and individual rights , and this leads to serious problems .
But from the modern perspective , the traditional values of East Asia are even less palatable .
In the traditional feudal society of China , the head of the family exercised unquestioned authority .
Under the precepts of filial piety , children had neither free will nor the right to be independent entities .
One of the tales in the Yuan dynasty work 24 Paragons of Filial Piety records that in ancient times a man named Guo Ju , who was too poor to keep his mother properly fed , proposed to his wife that they kill their three - year - old son - since he was consuming a share of the old lady 's food .
This they duly did , digging a pit and burying the boy alive .
The legal code of the Qing dynasty -LRB- 1644 - 1911 -RRB- stated that where parents brought charges against their offspring , the accused were automatically considered guilty and there was no need for a formal trial .
And for most of the past millennium , Chinese criminal law provided that unfililal conduct - such as hitting or cursing a parent - could be accepted as just cause in the cases of parents who murdered their offspring .
Those old - time filial paragons and legal codes are wildly at odds with today 's notions of children 's rights , and basic human rights as a whole .
According to Tang Mei - ying , a professor of primary education at Taipei Municipal Teachers College , Confucian thought does include emphasis on human rights , such as the expectation that fathers should be " compassionate , " sons " filially pious , " a monarch " benevolent " and his ministers " loyal . "
What it does n't do is propose ways of dealing with a father who is not compassionate and a monarch who is not benevolent .
Tang feels that Confucian thought basically stresses obligations , but that in modern society the idea of obligations is no longer a straightforward matter : when person A neglects to fulfil his obligations , person B can be said to have been deprived of his rights .
But when we start out from the notion of rights , and support those rights with legal guarantees , we find it is better to have guaranteed rights than to depend on everyone fulfilling their obligations .
The best of both worlds
Neighboring places heavily influenced by " Asian values , " such as Japan , Korea and Hong Kong , have a strong sense of how important it is to belong to " the educated class , " just as we do here .
As Tang Mei - ying points out , this means that parents expect their children to perform outstandingly well at school .
The importance that parents attach to education is of course a strong point for Taiwan , but one drawback of this is that parents often set their expectations too high .
At an age when most kids in the West are still playing every day , our children have already started shuttling about among supplementary schools for classes in English , computers , abacus and art .
Tang explains that although Western children seem to be playing about , they are also finding out what interests them , and they have plenty of chances to change direction .
Here , however , the education system gives children hardly any opportunity for making choices , and education is foisted on them rather than being something they seek for themselves .
Says Tang : " A lot of people these days hide themselves at graduate school , partly to put off confronting reality and partly to continue meeting their parents ' expectations .
Nowadays we even have cram schools for graduate school students . "
However , the Western educational model , in which children are shown respect and allowed to decide and choose for themselves , is not without drawbacks .
One American - who was pushing forty by the time he earned his PhD - says that when he was younger , whenever he had an important choice to make about his future and asked his parents for their opinion , the response was : " We 'll respect and support you no matter what you decide ! "
Now he feels that he has squandered a lot of time because of vacillation and a lack of clear guidance .
Modern parents at a loss
With today 's mingling of Eastern and Western values , and modern and traditional concepts , it is no wonder that parents find themselves at a bit of a loss .
The difficulty is that they ca n't simply dismiss deeply ingrained traditional notions , but at the same time they need to adapt to the values of the modern age .
The intellectual understanding is there but it has n't yet been fully internalized , and this accounts for the gap that can often be seen between understanding and behavior .
An inkling of this can be seen in the results of a recent online ballot conducted by the Hsin Yi Foundation , asking parents about their " educational approach or concepts . "
The runaway leader , with 21 % of votes , was the approach summed up in the sentence : " I praise my children with phrases like ' that 's great ! ' and ' good boy / girl ! ' "
Chang Sing - ju , executive director of the Hsin Yi Foundation , points out that modern parents know how important it is to give children encouragement , and this shows there has been a lot of progress .
But there are still pitfalls to watch out for .
Chang says that many parents use praise without making it clear to the child just what he is being praised for , and this " cheats " the child rather than showing him true respect .
It 's the process that counts
A child who is treated with respect wo n't stop studying on account of this .
And a child who is free to make his own choices does n't automatically turn into a delinquent .
Experimental classes giving pupils the chance for self - motivated study are now being offered in some schools in Taiwan , and the results show that these children are happier and more positive .
Joyce Yen Feng , executive director of the Child Welfare League Foundation , an organization dedicated to promoting the rights of children , says that there does n't have to be a contradiction between granting children their rights and maintaining Asian values .
In the past , too much emphasis on schoolwork and good grades encouraged the development of a society in which many are crudely obsessed with personal gain .
Stressing children 's rights is one way to change that mentality , and there is basically nothing un-Asian about using respect and enlightenment to pursue the very best outcome .
In other words , we need to draw on the strengths of both Eastern and Western culture , to show that Asian values are also global values .
East or the West , we 're all human and we share the same values , and this applies equally to the rights of children .

In this transitional era , caught between East and West , traditional and modern , parents have to be ready to respond to new challenges all the time .

Reproducing an Ancient Art :
Cheng Yung - gwo 's Prehistoric Pottery
-LRB- Elaine Chen / photos by Liu Teh - chang / tr. by Phil Newell -RRB-
In a lively and well - attended ceremony on an unusually warm and sunny winter 's day , the Yingko Ceramics Museum in Taipei County is formally opened to the public .
Especially noteworthy is Room 203 , " Echoes Across Space - Time , " where there is an exhibit that seems quite out of the ordinary : rough sandy earth , an upright measuring stick . . . it is more like the site of an archeological dig .
The layers of prehistoric pottery represent different cultures that existed at various times in the past .
It is almost impossible to tell that these rudimentary yet beautiful works of pottery are not the real thing .
They are in fact reproductions by the potter Cheng Yung - gwo .
It is especially fitting that they should be Cheng 's work , because this unusual artist was formerly a student of archeology .
Let 's go back to the eve of the opening .
The museum - located very near the Yingko interchange of the Second Northern Freeway - is hopping with people scurrying and working inside and out .
In the main hall on the first floor stand more than a dozen giant porcelain vases , representing the pottery industry of Yingko .
When you climb to the second floor , in Room 201 a worker is stirring cement with all his might in preparation for putting up a decorative wall of cement interspersed with ceramic pieces .
And in Room 203 , a group of people are busy putting the finished reproductions on display , documenting the process on video as they go along .
Suddenly there is a crash , followed by a gasp , and Lu Hsiu - chin , director of the Research and Collections Department , rushes in to see what has happened .
A camera lens has fallen off and struck a Yuanshan Culture jar .
" Teacher Cheng , is there anything wrong ? " asks Lu nervously .
Cheng Yung - gwo turns the piece in his hands , examining it carefully for damage .
Then he raises his head and smiles : " It 's a good thing I increased the kiln temperature to make these things more durable , because I was worried about the knocks they would take being moved around for the exhibition . "
Cheng Yung - gwo , who is addressed by the respectful title " Teacher Cheng " by all the museum staff high and low , is one of the Young Turks on the Taiwan ceramics scene .
He first gained fame with an award - winnnig entry in the annual Golden Ceramics Award competition .
But the most important reason why the Yingko Ceramics Museum gave him sole and total control over the recreation of the 36 pieces of prehistoric pottery in the exhibit is this : He is the only leading ceramicist in all of Taiwan who also graduated from university with a degree in archeology .
A great deal of effort has been devoted to opening new museums in Taiwan in recent years .
Besides institutions devoted to the natural sciences , the main focus has been on local Taiwanese history and aboriginal culture .
Examples include the National Museum of Prehistory , Taipei County 's Yingko Ceramics Museum and Shihsanhang Museum , and the privately founded Sheng Ye Museum of Formosan Aborigines .
For museums , the most important thing is of course to acquire items to display .
But most archeological artifacts are only shards , and the few items that have been found intact are jealously guarded by the institutions that dug them up ; they are rarely lent out .
Thus the Yingko Ceramics Museum 's only option was to find someone to make copies of the originals .
This was vital because , during the planning stage for the museum , it was decided to establish a very special room to be called " Echoes Across Space - Time . "
" We felt that Taiwan ceramics should cover more than just what Han Chinese people have done in the 400 years since large - scale migration began from the mainland , but should also include aboriginal and prehistoric pottery .
But it is quite a challenge to effectively create such a comprehensive display , especially since authentic pieces are so hard to come by . "
Lu Hsiu - chin reveals that most of the genuine items are held by the Department of Archeology and Anthropology at National Taiwan University -LRB- NTU -RRB- or by the Institute of History and Philology at the Academia Sinica .
Hung up on red tape
The museum sent a written request to NTU asking to borrow samples from which copies could be made , but that idea quickly hit the shoals .
NTU 's archeology departmental affairs committee decided that the museum should have first submitted a cooperation proposal prior to asking for any loans .
Lu Hsiu - chin says with exasperation : " This was not an unreasonable request .
But by that point we had no time to lose , and it would have been problematic to file a retroactive proposal . "
After asking around , the museum found an old gent - a specialist in making fiberglass reproductions of old artifacts - who had done similar work for the National Museum of Prehistory .
But when Lu examined the finished products , though the shapes were super , the reproductions did n't capture the texture of the original visually , much less when picked up in the hand .
At this point , Lu had little choice but to turn for help to Liu I - chang , a research fellow at the Institute of History and Philology .
Liu I - chang is renowned in the archeological community in Taiwan for his field research .
He has done the initial field work on dozens of important sites , including Shihsanhang , Tachuwei , and Peiyeh .
His ambition is to uncover the relationship between Taiwan 's indigenous peoples and its prehistoric cultures .
He is also the one who was asked to select the 36 prehistoric pottery samples to be displayed at the Yingko Ceramics Museum .
In love with archeology
Lu asked Liu for advice about people qualified to do reproductions of ancient pottery .
She hit the jackpot , because Liu happened to have a good friend named Cheng Yung - gwo , a ceramic artist , who had also studied in the Department of Archeology and Anthropology at NTU .
" Cheng was three years behind me in school , and we worked together on digs for many years .
When he was in college , he worked on the Peinan and Chihshanyen sites , " says Liu .
Peinan society had highly developed pottery arts , and Chihshanyen is a multi-layered site with artifacts from several cultures , and the pottery is even more refined .
In fact , Cheng 's inspiration for ceramics originally came from archeology .
Liu continues : " Though later Cheng left archeology to do ceramic art , he did not forget his affection for prehistoric pottery , and his early work was influenced by ancient painted pottery . "
Liu notes that in recent years there has been growing demand for archeological artifacts for displays , precisely fitting with Cheng 's familiarity with ceramic art and his understanding of archeological work .
As Lu Hsiu - chin says , with the satisfaction that comes of knowing one has got just what one wants , " He is the ideal person to do reproductions of prehistoric pottery . "
A ceramicist who reads academic papers
In fact , this is the fourth time that Cheng has done reproductions of prehistoric pottery .
He previously worked on special exhibitions of Chihshanyen and Yuanshan culture and also for the Taiwan Provincial Museum .
But never before had he been given a task as challenging as making reproductions representing all the major sites of prehistoric pottery in Taiwan .
In the process of making his recreations , Cheng was unable to get around the rigid system of controls to secure any original samples .
" What is so incredible about Cheng Yung - gwo is that he only looked at the samples and took back some photographs to work with , " says Liu I - chang .
Take for example the human - faced jar from the Shisanhang culture .
The visage depicted on the piece is of complex design , with sharp angles and corners .
For the work to be faithful to the original each angle had to be precise .
Cheng tackled this problem by assembling a number of paper models before getting to work .
But he also had to try to duplicate the red color of the piece , a color characteristic of Shisanhang pottery .
For this reason Cheng made a special trip to the Linkou Plateau to collect red clay .
But he found this material impossible to get into the right shape , so he had to add a certain proportion of general - purpose potter 's clay .
After several tries , he settled on a combination of three parts Tachia clay to one part Linkou clay , with a 35 % ratio of gravel , and a layer of 100 % Linkou red clay added to the outside .
Finally , he polished the surface with agate , creating a glossy effect and increasing the richness of the color .
Like a detective on a case
Even Liu I - chang could n't say enough about Cheng 's human - faced jar .
Pointing to the photo on the cover of the brochure for the Shisanhang site museum , he testifies : " I was the person who dug up the original , so I should know - the color in the photograph is not right , while Cheng is much closer to the real thing . "
For Cheng , the hardest thing was the facial expression .
" The face is not smiling , but it is not crying either , rather it looks a bit depressed . "
He says that this is a very impractical piece , so its original purpose was probably decorative or ritualistic .
In an effort to capture the ambivalent facial expression , he imagined the jar as a bust - length portrait of a woman .
She would be an elegantly dressed noblewoman , with brushed hair , and jewelry made from shells , with perhaps an agate necklace . . . .
" During his days as a student , " says Liu of Cheng , " he did hands - on work at archeological sites , digging up shards , observing , and in his mind recreating the process by which they may have been made .
He has always had a naturally deep attachment to archeology . "
Liu says that this is probably the reason why Cheng , when doing reproductions of prehistoric pottery , aims to capture the spirit of the originals , not just their surface appearance .
Even more important for reproducing prehistoric artifacts is good detective work .
You have to be able to reconstruct the general design of the original from clues on just a few shards .
Conclusions that rest on a single sample may easily be inaccurate .
Cheng , using his training in archeology and the concept of " correlation , " is able to link together a single sample with pieces from the same culture found nearby , allowing him to draw conclusions with confidence and to bring his creative abilities into play while remaining true to the original .
Reproducing the spirit of prehistoric pottery
Stop right there !
You might wonder : If he is making reproductions , how can he bring creativity into it ?
Cheng 's response is this : " I think that the original potters also followed their whims and improvised when they worked , and did n't rigidly make each embellishment by rote . "
Cheng considers the problem and then adds : " I not only want to reproduce the appearance of the originals , but also the spirit of the people who made them . "
The reconstruction of an Ilan square - patterned pottery jar found by Liu I - chang in the town of Chiushe is a good illustration of Cheng 's whole approach .
Upon inspecting the original , Cheng discovered that the walls were very thin .
If the decorative pattern had been stamped on after the clay had been formed , it would certainly have ruined the shape .
So how did the original maker get the pattern on there ?
Having repeatedly thought about this problem , Cheng concluded that prehistoric potters must have used an internal mold when working .
Perhaps they had shards that they could just pick up from the ground around them .
They could take the kneaded clay , wrap it on the outside of the shards , and tap it down lightly with a wooden stick to make the clay more compact and solid .
The stick would have patterns carved into it which would then be left imprinted on the clay .
But this decorative effect , thinks Cheng , was probably secondary to the functional purpose of compacting the clay .
With these ideas in mind , Cheng first ground up a handful of gravel , added it to the clay , and kneaded it vigorously .
Then he took a mold that had been made from the original sample , and spread the clay - now with the texture of pizza dough - on the outside .
Then he tapped it with a small stick , which he had personally prepared by paring off the bark and carving a pattern of squares into the wood .
Next he cut away the bottom of the jar and carefully removed it .
He repeated the process to make the top section , then connected the upper and lower parts .
Then , with his right hand he picked up the wood stick and tapped around the outside , while with his left he held a mushroom - shaped object against the inside of the jar to absorb the shock and prevent the jar from collapsing inward .
A careful examination of the finished jar - with its square pattern already imprinted - showed it to look exactly like the sample in the photo .
Dialogue with academia
To reconstruct these 36 pieces of pottery , as much as he could Cheng used the same tools as were available to their original makers .
In particular , he avoided using any iron implements , since none had been available back then .
When making the ceramic boar , he went into the bamboo forest in front of his house and cut off bamboo branches by hand to serve as the pig 's nostrils .
When there were no ready - made tools available , he made his own , such as the above - mentioned " mushroom head . "
" Such a ' mushroom head ' was unearthed at the Peinan site , " says Cheng , " and archeologists had no idea what it was for .
But people like me who make pottery can identify its function with one look . "
Liu I - chang states that his conversations with Cheng have given him much food for thought and allowed him to more accurately visualize the lifestyles and technology of prehistoric peoples .
" We help each other a lot . "
For instance , Cheng has brought his ceramicist 's mind 's eye to bear on the mystery of why gravel was mixed into prehistoric pottery .
In virtually all archeological reports , prehistoric pottery includes gravel , usually at a level of 25 - 30 % .
Some also includes shells or hornblende .
This is definitely not because prehistoric people were unable to get clay of greater purity .
On the contrary , the clay they used was often of higher quality than clay today .
Thus Cheng concludes that the inclusion of gravel must have been deliberate .
Cheng explains : " These days most ceramic artists buy factory - produced clay that meets a certain set of specifications .
Rarely would anybody add gravel .
After all , everybody uses electric kilns , because they offer precise temperature control , so their pieces can be fired slowly , with no risk of cracking from overly rapid heating or cooling . "
Prehistoric wisdom
But prehistoric peoples did not possess any of these things .
They had to dig , rinse , and filter their own clay , shape the pieces , then fire them all together in a big pile of wood under the open sky .
This is why they added gravel to the clay , liking mixing stones into mud , to increase its strength and so avoid having the pottery fracture as it first expanded under the heat and then contracted as it cooled .
From this we can see , affirms Cheng , that " prehistoric people understood how to use mixed materials , which was a major breakthrough in technique . "
Cheng found further indirect confirmation of his judgement about the technical skills possessed by prehistoric makers of pottery from a documentary on Japan 's NHK network .
In the film , a Japanese ceramic artist , an individual who is considered a " national treasure " of Japan , goes to visit a small island in Indonesia where everybody makes pottery .
When he arrives there , this great master becomes more like a youthful acolyte .
As the Japanese ceramicist slowly and steadily works the clay at his wheel , an elderly aboriginal woman working next to him just turns the wheel twice with her feet and shapes a finished ceramic jug .
The ability of the indigenous people on this small island to judge the quality of clay was even more impressive .
" They just toss some clay into their mouths and chew it around for a while , and they know whether it is good material or not .
When we buy clay , the first thing we look at is the written specifications , " says Cheng with a laugh .
Firebrand
Though Cheng was able to complete the full set of prehistoric pottery reproductions requested by the museum , and at a level of quality that received high grades from the museum and from consultant Liu I - chang , Cheng himself still feels there are things that he could have done better .
" The hardest part was getting the final color and texture of the originals to come through in the reproductions . "
Cheng relates that in this regard there were some factors he could manipulate , but others that were beyond his control .
" What kind of clay did prehistoric people use ?
At what temperature did they fire the pots ?
You do n't get the same feeling from artifacts that have been buried in the ground for thousands of years , exposed to microbes and chemical transformations , that you can get instantly from the recreated works that I am doing today . "
Cheng admits that if he utilized extraneous processes , such as exposing the pieces to wood smoke for a long time , he could get the colors closer to those of the actual artifacts , but then he would be losing something else at the same time .
Thus , before getting down to work on the final version of each piece , he made numerous trials , using different proportions of iron oxide , trying different temperatures , sometimes buffing the piece to make it glossy and other times not , to get as close as possible to the correct overall effect .
And then of course there was the problem that the pottery - making process in prehistoric times was markedly different from the modern procedure .
" These days we use electric kilns .
Though they are safer , they do not leave the same traces that prehistoric pottery has from being fired outdoors with uneven exposure to the heat . "
Cheng feels very strongly about this .
In Western mythology , man escaped the fate of the other animals by stealing fire from the gods , and it was fire that allowed the rise of bronze - age civilization and pottery cultures .
But now , fire has been taken offstage , and replaced by electricity .
The relationship between fire and potters has been severed by modern kilns .
" There is only the moment when you turn on the power - click - there is no physical sensation of kindling wood or smoke . "
Back to the tribal experience
After mulling over his experiences , Cheng decided that he is going to save up money to build the finest wood - fire pottery kiln in Taiwan .
This could not only restore the relationship between fire and potter , but could also induce Taiwan 's ceramic artists - among whom Cheng believes there is currently too much division and distance - to cooperate with each other .
" This could encourage interaction and partnership , and even in a small way create a sense of having returned to the tribal village . "
Now that 's a lovely thought .
Beside a road in Emei Rural Township in Hsinchu , the kind of narrow , winding mountain road where you need to beep your horn continually to warn possible oncoming cars around the corner , in the home that he and his wife Shen Tung - ching built with their own hands , just next to a pond surrounded by all kinds of large trees , Cheng Yung - gwo dreams of himself sitting with a group of friends and colleagues around a fire , " alternately firing pottery and drinking wine . "

ROC Diplomacy on the Move
Ever since the Republic of China withdrew from the United Nations in 1971 , nearly 30 years ago , Taiwan 's foreign relations have been in a state of chronic crisis - leaving the people of Taiwan with a diplomatic sword of Damocles hanging permanently overhead .
In the last 30 years , Taiwan has become an economic powerhouse , and Taiwanese have become world travelers , yet there 's not a trace of Taiwan in the United Nations .
The shooting may have stopped half a century ago in the Chinese Civil War , but the war has been extended by other means - diplomacy .
The overall international environment has not changed , but Taiwan 's government has .
Now the Democratic Progressive Party -LRB- DPP -RRB- , with which the Chinese Communist Party has no historical relationship , is the ruling party .
In line with the old saying " the newborn calf does n't know that it should fear the tiger , " the new government has been especially active on the diplomatic front .
In June of this year , Foreign Minister Tien Hung - mao visited Macedonia and the Vatican , the two countries in Europe that have formal diplomatic relations with the ROC .
In August , President Chen Shui - bian traveled to six of Taiwan 's diplomatic partners in Central America and Africa .
In September , Tien Hung - mao again journeyed to Europe , while Vice President Annette Lu followed up on the president 's trip to with a visit of her own to ROC diplomatic partners in Latin America .
As is commonly known , Taiwan 's diplomatic difficulties mainly are due to the cross-strait confrontation .
Will the flurry of high - level visits abroad by the new government bring the diplomatic breakthrough that Taiwan 's people almost do n't dare to hope for ?
Will China adopt a new containment policy ?
What counter-measures does the Taiwan government have ?
In these visits abroad , the president and vice president traveled with large retinues , but the foreign minister kept a low profile .
Does the new government have anything in its bag of tricks that the old hands in the former KMT administration did not try ?
Some say that " national sovereignty " and " economic assistance " are the two " Achilles heels " of Taiwan 's foreign relations .
As soon as they are mentioned , they draw crippling fire .
" National sovereignty " meets with powerful resistance from mainland China , which resists Taiwan 's efforts to establish interstate diplomatic links , a key indicator of sovereignty .
" Economic assistance , " on the other hand , though an important tool in maintaining diplomatic ties , has been frequently ridiculed in Taiwan as " checkbook diplomacy . "
Achilles heels
" National sovereignty " is reflected in a country 's ability to engage in diplomatic relations , but in this most critical area for national survival , Taiwan has long been suffering from PRC efforts to undercut Taiwan 's international status .
Indeed , as Levi C. Ying , an overseas Chinese legislator from the New Party , says , mainland China is the only real obstacle and enemy to Taiwan 's foreign relations .
In 1998 the PRC made the boast that by the year 2000 the ROC would have zero diplomatic partners , and moved to undercut Taiwan 's relationships .
They are still trying to achieve this target .
This July , a book published by the PRC entitled Chinese Foreign Policy , the Year 2000 , declared that its most important foreign policy goal is to " reunify the country , " and strongly attacked Taiwan 's efforts to be admitted to the United Nations .
In terms of its relationships with the US and Japan , mainland China makes the " Taiwan problem " a top priority .
Liu Pi - jung , a professor of politics at Soochow University , says that in looking at the diplomatic struggle between the ROC and PRC , it is useful to distinguish three arenas : the Asia - Pacific situation , formal diplomatic relations , and international organizations .
In terms of the Asia - Pacific situation , the PRC strongly resists any international support for Taiwan , such as the idea of placing Taiwan within the scope of the " Guidelines for US - Japan Defense Cooperation . "
Thus the attitude of the US has become one of the key factors in cross-strait relations .
Since the new DPP administration took office in Taipei , the PRC has been deeply worried by the party 's advocacy of Taiwan independence .
As a result , the two sides have yet to open any formal dialogue mechanism such as existed before the freezing of cross-strait relations which occurred after former president Lee Teng - hui went to the US in 1996 .
Meanwhile , Taiwan 's position in the US - PRC - ROC triangle has deteriorated as a result of Lee Teng - hui 's " special state - to - state " formula and mainland China 's active efforts to improve relations with the US .
An example of the latter is the September visit of PRC President Jiang Zemin to New York to participate in the United Nations millennial conference .
In the run - up to the US presidential election , there has been an effort by anti-Communist forces in the US to " demonize " China , and Jiang 's address to the UN - which was very friendly in tone and was delivered in English - is widely believed to have effectively improved the negative image of China in the US .
At the end of September , the US Congress passed a resolution granting the PRC permanent normal trade relations , bringing the bilateral relationship another step forward .
Track two
Jason Hu , formerly foreign minister and now director of the Department of Cultural Affairs in the KMT , warns that the US is already leaning toward the PRC in the trilateral relationship .
The PRC has been intensively lobbying the US on the principle of " one China , " and Taiwan can not sit idly by .
In fact , the new government in Taipei is aware of this point .
President Chen has openly asked the United States to play a more active balancing role in the Taiwan Strait .
Lee Ying - yuan , a DPP legislator who is tapped to be the next deputy representative of the ROC in Washington , states that at the moment the formal channels between Taiwan and the US are functioning very smoothly , and that Chen 's keeping of his promise to make an August stopover in Los Angeles very low - key has strengthened mutual trust between the US and the new government .
In addition , Taiwan is trying to strengthen so - called " track two " communications between think tanks in the ROC , PRC , and US .
" Think tanks have a considerable influence on government policies .
Strengthening contacts between the three sides would help mutual understanding , " says Lee .
Formal diplomatic partners
While the PRC is deeply involved in Taiwan 's relationship with the US , it has an even more immediate target : to break Taiwan 's formal diplomatic relationships , which give Taiwan the status of a sovereign country .
For many years now , the number of countries which recognize Taiwan has been between 28 and 30 , with the current number being 29 .
However , recently the PRC has been stepping up its pressure on ROC diplomatic partners in Latin America , Africa , and the South Pacific .
The book Chinese Foreign Policy , the Year 2000 specifically states that Beijing is targeting Taiwan 's diplomatic partners in Central America - Guatemala , Honduras , El Salvador , Nicaragua , Costa Rica , Panama , Haiti , and the Dominican Republic - for upgrading of formal relationships .
The book also mentions ways in which improvement in ties has taken place .
For example , says the book , last year relations between Beijing and Panama took a giant step forward , indicating that rumors in Taipei about a possible break in relations with Panama were not completely unfounded .
Also , when Chen Shui - bian visited the Dominican Republic in August , the ROC ambassador there reported that in 1997 , the PRC managed to get the Dominican Republic 's agreement to the establishment of a PRC office in the DR capital by playing on the DR 's desire to extend its consular rights in Hong Kong .
In Africa , last year the PRC tried very hard to get Taiwan 's eight diplomatic partners on that continent to participate in the " Sino - African Cooperation Forum " held in Beijing in October .
Although ultimately all eight refused , the PRC 's determination to strengthen interactions with these eight countries is unmistakable .
Meanwhile , in the South Pacific , there were gains and losses , with the ROC losing its formal ties with Tonga but gaining formal recognition from the Marshall Islands .
Fish in water
Taiwan does not have many cards to play in developing formal diplomatic relationships .
Early on , Taiwan 's agricultural technology and the dedication of its agricultural cooperation teams helped maintain relations with African and South Pacific countries .
In recent years , Taiwan 's economic power - including both financial assistance and overseas investment - has added another card to play .
Nevertheless , Taiwan 's foreign assistance programs have been a subject of considerable criticism at home .
In the past the Democratic Progressive Party repeatedly attacked foreign aid , and the fact that the DPP now holds the presidency has n't reduced the general dissatisfaction with it .
Levi Ying says that the old government gave out financial assistance " as if money grew on trees . "
Yet the new government , which criticized this policy in the past , is following the same old path .
" Although you can argue that it is vital to maintain formal diplomatic relations with as many countries as possible until such time as there is a tacit diplomatic cease - fire with Communist China , today , when Taiwan 's budget faces growing constraints and the island has not yet recovered from the recent earthquake , it is not acceptable for the government to be spreading such a huge amount of money abroad . "
What is so important about financial assistance that both the old and the new administrations place such emphasis on it ?
Former foreign minister Jason Hu defends foreign aid by arguing that there are two kinds of countries in the world : those that help and those that need help .
In the past Taiwan was a recipient of American aid , so now that Taiwan has the economic power to return the favor to the international community , it should do so .
Moreover , explains Hu , " In fact the amount of money Taiwan spends on foreign assistance is very limited .
Currently the UN asks that OECD countries try to spend 0.7 % of their GNP on foreign aid .
Although most countries do not reach this level , most spend at least 0.2 % .
Taiwan , on the other hand , is spending only about 0.1 % ! "
Since there is a basic obligation to help all countries in need , and Taiwan is already doing less than it should , it is all the more understandable that Taiwan gives aid to countries with which it has formal diplomatic relations .
Jaw - ling Joanne Chang , a researcher at the Institute of European and American Studies at the Academia Sinica , says that the public needs to look at the issue from a new angle .
Relations between the ROC and its diplomatic partners should be seen as mutually beneficial .
Taiwan 's diplomatic partners have economic needs , so we give financial assistance .
We have diplomatic problems , so our diplomatic partners support our entry into international organizations .
Each side gets something it needs , and the relationship can not be summed up as a purely financial one .
Chang continues : " It is shallow to see the maintenance of relations between the ROC and its diplomatic partners as depending only on money .
Ties with some Latin American countries go back 40 or 50 years .
Such a long period of friendship can not be explained only by the size or wealth of the countries involved .
" In fact , in recent years the PRC has spent much larger sums of money than Taiwan in trying to woo away the ROC 's diplomatic partners .
In addition , it often dangles its enormous domestic market before them as an inducement .
Take for example the so - called " banana diplomacy " the PRC employed toward Costa Rica three years ago .
Attempting to take advantage of the fact that bananas are Costa Rica 's main export , the PRC , through private channels , indicated that it would be willing to purchase Costa Rican bananas at a high price .
However , because the PRC has no formal diplomatic relations with Costa Rica , they would have to add a 40 % customs tax .
This was clearly an effort to use commercial incentives to force the Costa Rican government 's hand .
As it turned out , Costa Rican bananas had been contracted out early to large corporations , and also some of the companies commissioned by the PRC failed to pay up as promised , causing Costa Rican farmers to lose confidence in them .
As a result , the PRC goal was not achieved .
Nonetheless , from this case you can see that PRC diplomacy has been extended to cover the commercial field as well .
Learning from this , President Chen says that Taiwan must deepen its economic diplomacy .
The government must take the lead in negotiating the construction of markets and the creation of business opportunities with other countries and international organizations .
Meanwhile , businesses must collectively move to the front line .
Only in this way can a win - win situation for both diplomacy and trade be created .
The problem is that Taiwan has been engaged in economic diplomacy for many years now , yet the results are not particularly obvious .
Jason Hu says that currently economic diplomacy has shown only limited results , but there are still areas where the new government can work harder .
" The main thing the government can do is provide information and convenience .
This requires coordination among the Government Information Office [ GIO ] , MOEA , and foreign ministry .
Yet , so far , only the GIO has sent staff to diplomatic partners to coordinate , while the MOEA has not posted staff to all relevant overseas offices , " he says .
Greater effort and creativity is needed in economic diplomacy , which in turn requires more study and discussion among the political parties , businessmen , and the academic community , as well as greater flexibility and coordination in the MOFA and other government agencies .
Process vs. outcomes
The number of ROC diplomatic partners is far behind that of the PRC , which seriously impedes Taiwan 's efforts to take part in international organizations .
For international organizations of which the PRC is already member , such as the United Nations , although Taiwan has repeatedly knocked at the door , it has met with repeated failure as a result of international pressure imposed by the PRC under the " one China " principle .
As for the World Trade Organi - zation , to which both sides are attempting to gain entry as early as possible , the PRC has brought its diplomatic superiority to bear in order to ensure that it will enter prior to Taiwan .
However , because negotiations with the United States on early PRC entry have not reached a successful outcome , PRC entry has been continually postponed , which has seriously affected the schedule for ROC entry .
In this age of the global village , international organizations are increasingly important .
How much room to maneuver does Taiwan have in this respect ?
Lo Chih - cheng , chairman of Research and Planning Board at the MOFA , believes that Taiwan still has room to maneuver in terms of international economic organizations .
But as for the UN and its affiliated organizations , such as the World Health Organization or UNESCO , the ROC faces countless obstacles .
In fact , the ROC is currently the only nation that enjoys sovereignty that is excluded from United Nations .
When Chen Shui - bian visited Costa Rica in August , the president of that country , Miguel Angel Rodriguez , indicated for the first time that his country would be willing to help Taiwan enter the UN .
But he suggested that Taiwan should reconsider its tactical approach ; otherwise repeated failure could cause people to lose interest and faith .
In fact , this has already happened in Taiwan 's public , which has seen the UN effort fail repeatedly .
People are wondering whether something should be changed in the ROC approach to the UN .
Lo Chih - cheng says that you can not only look at the results of efforts to enter the UN - you also have to look at the significance of the process .
" Applying for entry to the UN demonstrates that Taiwan is a sovereign state and is qualified to be a UN member .
This reminds the international community to be aware of Taiwan 's existence .
In addition , from the perspective of the foreign ministry , efforts to re-enter the UN are not only excellent training for diplomatic personnel , but also provide a regular test of how secure relations are between the ROC and its diplomatic partner states , " explains Lo .
The PRC worked for 21 years to gain entry to the UN , while we have only been at it a few years .
There 's no point in getting overanxious .
It 's not impossible that the general environment will change .
This year the ROC application to the UN particularly emphasized that the UN could serve as a forum for the peaceful resolution of the cross-strait problem .
This increases international understanding of Taiwan 's sincerity vis - a - vis the cross-strait and international relations issues .
Flexible diplomacy
Looking at the overall diplomatic situation , the new government faces more challenges , not fewer .
That being the case , so far , how has the new foreign policy team been doing ?
Joanne Chang of the Academia Sinica says that although most people feel that the new government 's strategies - " diplomacy of the whole people , " economic diplomacy , and entry into nongovernmental organizations - differ little from the past , you must remember that diplomacy is a long - term game , and , in the details , the new foreign policy team has already brought in some fresh air .
For example , she notes , recently the MOFA , through its " virtual diplomacy institute , " has begun offering a class in " diplomacy of the whole people " that provides training to legislative assistants , political party staff , and employees of nongovernmental organizations .
The aim is to develop the capability to participate in international affairs among a wider public .
In addition , the government is continuing to encourage and assist private groups to participate in nongovernmental organizations , is eliminating the units abroad which have proven ineffective , and is promoting " human rights diplomacy . "
All of these are new approaches in foreign affairs .
Lo Chih - cheng relates that , though there is no direct and immediate impact on inter-state relations as a result of private participation in nongovernmental organizations , nevertheless such participation can strengthen communication and contact between peoples .
The Research and Planning Board intends to establish a special NGO subcommittee , led by the government , to provide information and practical assistance to domestic NGOs in Taiwan .
Lo explains that in democratic countries , with whom Taiwan would like to strengthen ties , public opinion is the source of policy direction .
So over the long term , people - to - people contacts will definitely have a positive effect .
This is also the thinking behind the government 's advocacy of " human rights diplomacy . "
By emphasizing the government 's concern for human rights on the international stage , not only can Taiwan make its own democratization experience available for other countries currently going through the same process , it can bring itself closer to those countries which also place a strong emphasis on human rights .
Besides promoting new ideas , says Lo , the MOFA is also undertaking internal reform .
In early September the MOFA announced that , based on efficiency evaluations , the government would close its representative offices in the African countries of the Congo , Angola , and Madagascar .
As Lo says , " The ROC must move in the direction of flexible diplomacy and utilize foreign policy resources more flexibly . "
In the future , overseas offices of the ROC will undertake functional integration at the continental level , with different locations having different specialties , such as overseas Chinese affairs , political affairs , and media relations .
All the offices in a particular region will be linked into a single , more efficient , and more richly endowed cooperative group .
Lo says that the main countries that will be at the center of future diplomatic work , besides the ROC 's existing diplomatic partners , will be the nations of North America and Europe .
" The academic community is a major source of staff people for the executive branch , while congressmen set the direction of legislation and executive officials determine how it is implemented .
In the future more emphasis will be placed on contacts at these three levels with European and North American countries , " he says .
Though in office for less than four months , foreign minister Tien Hung - mao has already been to Europe twice .
Based on his comments , analysts infer that Taiwan may in the near future establish formal diplomatic relations with another European country .
Soft diplomacy
Following closely on President Chen 's trip , in late September Vice President Annette Lu traveled to Central American countries that President Chen could not fit into his itinerary , including El Salvador , Honduras , Belize , and Guatemala , all of which have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan .
This visit , which has been called " soft diplomacy , " breaks the previous mold of focusing on political and economic power .
Instead , the vice president 's delegation included members of the cultural , religious , and scientific communities , and elected officials as well .
In contrast to the male way of thinking , in which priority has always been given to considerations of political and economic power , Annette Lu has emphasized " soft national power . "
Before her departure she stated that Taiwan advocates human rights , democracy , high - technology , compassion , and peace .
If Taiwan can further develop foreign relations using such " soft power , " one day the United Nations will turn around and want Taiwan to join .
Diplomats are anxious for a breakthrough that will reverse negative trends .
But many people say that the root of the ROC 's foreign policy difficulties is still in the relationship with the PRC .
Right now the two sides are at an impasse .
It is unlikely there will be any progress on diplomatic or cross-strait issues between the two sides .
Before departing on his trip , President Chen repeatedly stressed that , despite the tremendous pressure coming from the mainland , there are other considerations in foreign policy .
Indeed , says Joanne Chang , it is precisely because diplomatic and cross-strait issues are inextricably intertwined that foreign policy breakthroughs are needed .
If more states support Taiwan , Taipei will have more cards to play in cross-strait negotiations , and domestic morale will be bolstered and people 's fears alleviated .
As President Chen said , determination is power .
The global values espoused by Taiwan , including democracy , human rights , love , and peace , are the real assets of ROC diplomacy .
The old saying has it that " a person of high morals will never be alone . "
We now look with high hopes to the international community .
Taiwanese TV Gets Taiwanized !
Eric Lin / tr. by Phil Newell
Recently the 8:00 p.m. serials being shown on television in Taiwan have shown a trend toward " Taiwanization . "
Three out of the four main broadcast stations are showing prime - time Taiwanese drama , and these are pulling in nearly three - quarters of the viewing audience .
Of these programs , Fortune is in Heaven 's Hands , broadcast by Formosa Television , stands at the top of the heap .
It is said that , along with pop music , prime - time TV serials are one of the most important elements of Taiwanese popular culture , and that they reflect social trends .
What then is the relationship between the rise of Taiwanese drama -LRB- that is , mainly in the Taiwanese dialect and focused on the lives of distinctly Taiwanese - as opposed to " mainlander " - characters -RRB- and contemporary society and culture in Taiwan ?
Do these shows reflect the real lives and aspirations of the audience ?
And what kinds of limitations exist ?
" Mama !
Do n't beat me any more !
Mama ! "
Little Ho - ho , a student at the Yungho Wanghsi Primary School , is showing off to his aunt some Taiwanese - language lines he learned from television .
Ho - ho is a typical child of a northern Taiwan mainlander family -LRB- i.e. a family which came to Taiwan from mainland China only after WWII -RRB- .
Because he spoke only Mandarin Chinese at home and at school , he did n't really know any Taiwanese until recently .
But in the last couple of years his Taiwanese has improved dramatically , thanks to the 8:00 p.m. serials .
Ho - ho 's guardian , his aunt Tsui Mei - lan , bemoans the fact that " Taiwan 's prime - time shows are violent , and even the love stories have people constantly slapping each other and arguing violently , so they are really not suitable for small children . "
But when Ho - ho told her that he wanted to watch these programs every evening in order to learn Taiwanese , Tsui , who all her life has experienced the problems of not being able to speak or understand Taiwanese , found it hard to refuse .
The child 's rapid success at picking up Taiwanese has amazed her .
The revival of reality
Little Ho - ho 's line - " Do n't beat me any more ! " - reflects one of the more common themes of TV shows done in Taiwanese .
Beating of children , often by an evil stepmother , is not unusual .
This is not because Taiwanese are especially firm believers in corporal punishment .
Rather this kind of thing is a " trademark " that has become attached to Taiwanese drama over the course of its history .
As a result , even though " nativist drama " has escaped the stereotypical setting of the Taiwanese countryside of the past and increasingly focuses on contemporary urban life , such provocative scenes - playing to elemental emotions to pull on the heart - strings - are still common .
" Taiwanese serials depict the daily life of ordinary people the way they do because of their development process , " says Ko Yu - fen , an associate professor of mass communications at Shih Hsin University , who has done a study of Taiwan TV drama .
" And now , because of the trend in society of reviving Taiwanese as the mother tongue , Taiwanese drama has been able to leap into prime time to become the mainstream offering in the past few years . "
The 8:00 p.m. time slot has long been the flagship and leading money maker for television stations .
For a program to get into this slot , besides being commercially viable , in the past it also had to be politically correct .
This used to mean : " No use of the Taiwanese language . "
Because the government wanted to promote Mandarin , Taiwanese was officially seen as a rustic dialect , and was never eligible for prime time .
The three government - run television stations of that era - China Television -LRB- CTV -RRB- , Chinese Television Service -LRB- CTS -RRB- , and Taiwan Television -LRB- TTV -RRB- - had a tacit agreement that they would only show Taiwanese programs at noon or in the 6:30 p.m. time slot , when most viewers would be housewives and elderly people .
The programming for these time slots was low - budget , and the subject matter limited to ordinary life in Taiwan 's unsophisticated rural past , mostly tragic tales of mistreated daughters - in - law and the like , or family comedies .
Thus , for a long time , Taiwanese drama gave people the impression of being lowbrow .
It was not until 1990 , with the broadcasting of the series Love on CTS , that the prime - time language taboo was even partly challenged .
This series also raised the quality of Taiwanese drama , and planted the seeds for future efforts .
The show was set against the background of the August 7th Flood of 1959 .
The story portrayed how some Taiwanese and mainlanders went from mutual misunderstanding to mutual forgiveness .
The performers spoke in both Mandarin and Taiwanese .
Because the language taboo has long carried heavy political undertones - the opposition has always preferred the use of Taiwanese , the ruling party has , until recently , almost exclusively favored Mandarin - the producers invited many people from the arts community to confirm that Taiwanese was essential for the program , so as to dispel the suspicions of those who would see political motives behind language choice .
Unfortunately , the effort was less than a complete success .
For one thing , stereotypes remained strong , and Love still retained many of the old traditions , being a tragic small family drama focusing on a young bride facing hard times after moving into the husband 's home .
Moreover , because of opposition from high officials at the television network , after several episodes , the performers who had previously spoken in Taiwanese had their dialogue changed to " Mandarin with a Taiwanese accent . "
However , because the plot was realistic , ratings were unprecedented , and Love even defeated Widow 's Watch , based on a novel by , and also produced by , the vastly popular romance writer Chiung Yao , and broadcast on CTV .
At that time , many commentators suggested that Love was successful largely because of the use of Taiwanese .
But Lin Ling - ling , a script writer for Widow 's Watch , says that the real reason Love succeeded was because of its realistic depiction of the lives of Taiwanese .
Her opinion is that " love stories involving constant hitting and screaming and dramatic twists and turns are not the stuff of real life , and Chiung Yao 's series departed too far from reality .
This in fact has been a chronic problem of Taiwan 's dramatic serials . "
Love succeeded largely because it wedded realism to Taiwanese subject matter .
Politics in command ?
However , though the series was popular , it did not immediately spark a wave of enthusiasm for Taiwanese subject matter .
The government around that time adopted a policy of allowing producers to go to mainland China to film , and there was a sudden craze for martial arts series and love stories framed against a mainland backdrop .
Still , television stations and producers had awakened to the existence of an audience for " nativist " Taiwanese drama .
After the Qingdao Lake incident in 1994 , " mainland fever " plummeted , and nativist stories using the Taiwanese language once again saw their star rising .
This time they went right at major political taboos like the February 28 Incident of 1947 .
Writer Lin Ling - ling used the White Terror as subject matter to write the second major nativist prime - time drama in Taiwan television history - Taiwan Outlaws of the Marsh .
It was so popular that its producer , Hsu Chin - liang , ended up making a trilogy around the same theme .
Lin explains : " I always want to write a Taiwanese drama against the backdrop of great events , and the February 28 Incident was at that time just beginning to get intensive open discussion , so there was a lot of commercial viability as well . "
Owing to the series ' popularity , lead actor Lun Hsiao - hua has become a major television star , while female lead Chen Mei - feng established her image as a traditional Taiwanese woman of gentility and virtue , and has since gotten numerous roles and television commercials .
However , says Lin with a laugh , things did n't go exactly as she expected .
" Because the writer , director , and actors all had different political orientations , after the first several episodes which laid out the background of the era were produced , the plot shifted toward traditional family relations and romance , along the lines of the typical prime - time serial . "
The series was nonetheless a watershed .
Taiwanese was no longer taboo , and indeed identification with " Taiwanese-ness " came to be highly admired .
Ko Yu - fen states that it is not difficult to understand these trends against the backdrop of society at that time .
Taiwan Outlaws of the Marsh was broadcast just after the first direct popular elections for municipal mayors and provincial governor , when the " underground " call - in television programs were at their peak of popularity , and when discussion of " Taiwanese identity " was at a fever pitch .
Hsu Hsiao - tsu , a former aide to the legislative caucus of the Democratic Progressive Party , recalls that although Taiwan Outlaws of the Marsh did not go very deeply into the historical facts and controversies of the February 28 Incident , he and his friends , enthusiastic student activists in the opposition movement , felt that it was of great symbolic importance that prime - time television - which had always represented conservative values - was broadcasting a series on this subject using both Taiwanese and Mandarin .
He laughs , " Even though I usually do n't have any interest in watching TV , at that time we tuned in at eight sharp every night , as a kind of moral support . "
Ko Yu - fen says , however , that times have changed .
Linguistic and historical conditions politicized Taiwanese drama .
There had always been controversy over it .
But the political significance faded , and , with the daughter - in - law series beginning in 1995 , Taiwanese drama became embroiled in a very different controversy - that it was oversimplified and stereotypical , and that the clock had been turned back to the early days of Taiwanese - language programming .
The daughter - in - law series was a collection of all - Taiwanese - language stories broadcast by CTS , describing the relationship between daughters - in - law and mothers - in - law in Taiwan 's traditional rural society .
The first of the series , The Astonishing Daughter - in - Law , got an enthusiastic audience response , and the show , which like all prime - time serials was broadcast nightly Monday to Friday , lasted for nearly a year .
The hard - pressed daughter in law
The story of The Astonishing Daughter - in - Law is quite simple .
The daughter - in - law , played by Chang Yu - yen , is mistreated by her mother - in - law , and , with outsiders butting in and causing trouble , she gets abused from beginning to end .
Yet she maintains her traditional womanly virtues , never fights back , and in the end is rewarded with a happy ending .
Although Chang does not speak Taiwanese very well , her pitiable demeanor won a lot of sympathy from the audience .
Juan Chin - jung , a Changhua County civil servant and longtime fan of TV serials , says critically , " It drove me nuts watching the daughter - in - law just sit there and take abuse from her mother - in - law day in and day out .
Also , the costumes and sets were so crude , there was no difference from a typical 6:30 show . "
Yet , she says , her grandmother was in tears every day , explaining that young women today could never understand the suffering and indignities endured by daughters - in - law in the past .
Ko Yu - fen ascribes the success of the daughter - in - law series to several factors :
" By playing on people 's heart strings , using Taiwanese language , and being set against the background of that bitter era , the daughter - in - law series brought together all the traditional elements of the Taiwanese drama , but in addition added new structure and packaging , and integrated the spiciness and conflict typical of an 8:00 show .
No wonder it was so successful . "
Lin Ling - ling says that criticism of 8:00 serials for being melodramatic is certainly not without foundation , yet , however people may criticize , there are still viewers who ca n't get enough .
The audience is composed mainly of older folk and housewives .
In general , they do n't want to watch something they have to really think too much about .
The simpler the characters and the plot , and the more conflict there is , the better .
Lin adds that intellectuals criticize such shows but in fact do n't watch TV .
Television stations have always based their decisions on ratings , and it is virtually impossible to expect that they will change a proven formula .
" Rather than say that serials are a mirror of life , it would be better to say that people identify with the characters in these dramas even if their own lives are not as dramatic . "
These are the terms used by Tsai Yen , a professor in the department of broadcasting and television at National Chengchi University .
This is particularly the case for older people and housewives .
According to Tsai , the formula for success revolves around romance or family relations .
For dramatic effect , there need to be elements of hatred or revenge , and usually one irredeemably evil character whose purpose is to create obstacles to the romantic or career success of the main character .
The focus is extremely narrow - personal achievement .
Social issues serve only as background or embellishment .
The daughter - in - law series precisely fits this structure .
Realistic fashion
After the daughter - in - law series , there was a uniformity in dramatic serials all following the trend .
Taiwanese drama went into a steady decline .
However , just when things looked bleakest , nativist drama began to break out of its previous framework with the appearance of the " river of time " structure , characterized by a cross-generational story depicting long - term social evolution in Taiwan .
This format incorporates the rural themes of traditional Taiwanese drama , but the stories evolve with time , and also portray modern urban life .
Not only has this format given new life to Taiwanese drama , it has also pioneered an entirely new type of television drama - contemporary realism .
Formosa Television had enthusiastic audiences for Springtime Stepmother 's Heart in 1998 .
The character of actress Pai Ping - ping played against the stereotype of the abusive stepmother , instead being a woman who brings two of her own children into a marriage into a wealthy family .
She has to deal on the one hand with the lack of understanding from her mother - in - law and on the other look after four children from different families as well as the husband 's first wife , who suffers from mental illness .
And after financial setbacks , she also has to support the whole family .
Because the series was so popular , FTV seized the opportunity and presented a sequel based on the loves and hates of the third generation , which , as expected , also was very well received .
Springtime Stepmother 's Heart pulled FTV financially out of the red and into the black , and is considered an extremely remarkable event in Taiwan television history .
Executive chairman Chen Kang - hsin proudly calls the new format developed by FTV " contemporary drama . "
Lien Chang - yu , a senior reporter covering film and TV for the United Daily News , explains that FTV has been successful in the 8:00 time slot not only because " the use of Taiwanese language fits right in with the trends of the times , " but also because " the inclusion of little conversations and incidents that occur in everyday life makes these series accessible and familiar to the viewers . "
That TV stations agree can be seen from the most recent offering from FTV , Fortune is in Heaven 's Hands , which offers a realistic depiction of urban life .
Fortune is also cross-generational .
The story begins with the death of the husband of the main female character .
She struggles to raise her infant son , and is a frequent target of criticism from her mother - in - law .
The son then grows into adulthood , and all the feelings - gratitude , revenge , love , hate - of the older generation carry on into the younger .
In the city the children help each other and compete against each other as the story grows increasingly explosive .
The combination of traditional Taiwanese and contemporary factors has made the show a hit .
Lien Chang - yu says that recently three of the four broadcast stations have been showing Taiwanese drama , but FTV 's ratings stand alone , far ahead of all the others .
A show can not be popular simply by using Taiwanese language , she says - the audience must be able to identify with it .
This is how the series Real Love from Hong Kong cable TV has stayed so popular that it has run uninterrupted for several years .
ON programming
The success of serials means that TV stations in Taiwan just keep on cranking them out , broadcasting episodes as quickly as they are shot .
This special feature of Taiwan 's 8:00 time slot means that one can naturally not be too picky about quality .
Lu Hsiao - fen , a film star who has won numerous awards at the Golden Horse and Asia - Pacific film festivals and who has recently jumped into prime time as the female lead in Fortune , explains : " They have a special name for shows that are being broadcast episode by episode as each one is shot : ' ON programming . '
It is common for an episode finished today to be shown two days later . "
She finds this situation less than ideal .
She says that in order to keep up with the audience 's ever - changing tastes , scripts are being rewritten right up to the last minute .
Naturally television actors do not have the luxury that movie actors enjoy of allowing themselves time to slowly get in the right frame of mind for a role or scene , but even so , given the fact that TV actors must rely almost exclusively on dialogue and body language to keep the audience 's attention , the fact that shooting is so hurried not only waters down the quality of the performance , there is little time even to get the lines right .
Such conditions , she feels , make for productions that are really too rough around the edges .
Chou You , who has produced more than 4,000 hours of dramatic series for television , says that prime time is like a battlefield for television stations .
Sometimes the producer ca n't call the shots .
Personally , she has always preferred to begin broadcasting only after the entire series has been completed , to ensure quality control .
But if a series is doing well , the station will want to extend it , and if ratings are less than ideal , the series must be prepared to wrap up at any moment .
The series on which Chou has recently been working had the final rushes confiscated by the network so that it can decide how to edit them , in order to determine how long the series will actually run .
" Even I do n't know when it will come to an end , " she says with exasperation .
Pop merchandise
April Chu , the producer of Fortune is in Heaven 's Hands , admits that ON programming is a real bottleneck for Taiwanese drama .
But there is no quick - fix .
With the practical environment being what it is , people will simply have to think their way out of its limitations .
" ON programming is simply the way Taiwan television works .
If the station strategy is set up that way , it 's unlikely they will change .
The only solution is through restructuring of the content , strengthening the rhythms , reducing the use of pointless patter to draw out the series , improving the dramatic structure , and adding new vitality to the roles . "
But how ?
She takes for example feminist issues , about which she is particularly concerned .
Twenty years ago , she wrote a TV serial that overturned the tradition that the female lead had to be chaste , unmarried , and dependent on men ; instead her female lead was a middle - aged divorcee with children and a relationship with a younger man .
Society was shocked from top to bottom .
Today , as she produces Fortune , she still devotes special attention to the molding of the women 's roles .
From the character of the grandmother to that of the daughter , she insists that the script give them independent and strong - willed vitality .
She says , " Although you can say that prime time serials are merchandise and not art , you have to present up - to - date positive values .
You have to be responsible to the audience , and that 's also the key to continual innovation . "
Developing overseas markets
Taiwanese television serials have always sold well abroad .
But some people are concerned that an overemphasis on Taiwanese themes and language will stifle the development of overseas sales .
" By nature , television drama is very localized .
Because of cultural differences , overseas audiences will not necessarily like the same things Taiwan audiences do , " says reporter Lien Chang - yu .
That is why many " blue - chip " producers who control overseas copyrights are unwilling to touch nativist serials .
They prefer to do martial arts or love stories that focus on no particular era or social backdrop .
Lin Ling - ling , on the other hand , believes that Taiwanese drama should have no problems holding its own against competition from other areas .
She says that Hong Kong drama generally maintains good pacing , but the way they handle dialogue , content , and emotion is not very convincing .
PRC TV provides dramas which interpret actual historical events -LRB- as opposed to Taiwan 's " historical " dramas which are mainly just made - up stories in period costume -RRB- , but they are too slow - moving .
Japanese TV relies mostly on packaging of well - known " idols , " with most of the effort going into the aesthetics of presentation , and little emphasis on storyline .
Taiwan television drama , on the other hand , has conflict and intensity , and if it is well packaged , it should do well in the overseas market .
" You ca n't say that there 's no overseas market for drama just because it is nativist Taiwanese .
After all , Hong Kong drama series have dominated the Asian market for years , yet they also use a Chinese dialect - Cantonese - and are also set against the backdrop of their own Hong Kong society .
However , due to the strength of their entertainment industry , they 've been able to penetrate everywhere , " says Tsai Yen .
Taiwan can learn from this experience .
Talent flow
As interactions between Taiwan and the PRC have grown , over the past few years there have been many cases of cooperative filming involving Taiwan , Hong Kong and mainland China , or of the hiring of technicians or performers from one area to work in another .
For example , for the martial arts dramas of Yang Pei - pei , the scripts and actors come from Taiwan , the director and the costume designer are from Hong Kong , and the series are filmed in the PRC using mainland technicians .
Technically speaking , they are extremely well done .
The same goes for Chiung Yao 's romantic dramas .
However , given the different cultural backgrounds of these people , there are limits to cooperation , and if you factor in political considerations , that makes the situation even more complex .
" Cross-national cooperation is the fastest way to get an infusion of fresh blood , but it is not a long - term solution , " says Lien Chang - yu .
Recently the PRC has begun to limit the number of people who can work in cooperative projects in order to protect its own TV industry , and sudden changes such as this will inevitably have an impact .
Prime time programming has long been a weaver of dreams for Taiwanese audiences .
But there is a huge difference between today 's society and that of 30 years ago .
If the dreams woven by the serials stay the same , or are even inferior , inevitably the audience will decline .
Given the ever growing pluralization of society in Taiwan , these shows must find new talent , overcome formulaic stories , and halt the decline in audience share .
Those in the industry must figure out how to draw people back .

So - called " ON programming " - meaning that series episodes are shot right before the time of broadcast - is a special feature of Taiwan 's prime - time televised serials .
The advantage is that the story can be changed or the series extended or shortened depending upon ratings .
The disadvantage is that quality may suffer .

Ritek 's Yeh Chin - tai

" MP3 is fine when you 're using it with earphones , but if you try to play it through speakers , the bass just disappears .
CDs are much better . "
Recently Ritek released a mini disc that can be used with MP3 players or PDAs that has attracted great attention on the market .
But in the view of Yeh Chin - tai , Ritek 's CEO , MP3 is little more than a toy for kids .
It 's simply not good enough for more discriminating audiophiles .
Optoelectronics is seemingly the exclusive province of the new " technobility , " in which case Yeh Chin - tai , a plastics entrepreneur and manufacturer of phonograph records , breaks the mold .
At the age of 60 , he created Ritek , which is now the world 's largest manufacturer of CD - ROMs , shipping 2 billion a year .
This old technologist , now 73 , has been a key behind - the - scenes player in bringing high - quality products to the world 's audiophiles and videophiles .
Hsu Tsang - houei , a major figure in Chinese music who recently passed away , specially thanked Yeh Chin - tai when the CD A Selection of Taiwanese Folk Music was released last November .
Almost all of the musicians on hand for the launch had heard of Yeh , but very few knew that he was the CEO of Ritek , a company worth billions of NT dollars .
Treasure amid black plastic
Before founding Ritek , Yeh was already a well - known figure in the Taiwan recording industry .
In the 1960s , Hsu Tsang - houei , Shih Wei - liang and other musicians labored hard at making collections of Taiwanese folk songs , but they were n't able to release them .
It was n't until 1979 , when Hsu delivered an impassioned speech at the Sanchung Rotary Club about this problem , that it struck a chord with someone who could do something about it .
At that time Yeh Chin - tai was CEO of First Records , which subsequently released a series of 21 albums , including recordings of Hakka eight tone , Fujian ten tone , Hengchun - style sing - and - tell , and so forth .
It was the best collection of Taiwanese folk music ever made .
Although the series , as expected , did n't make any money , for three years running it won the Golden Tripod , Taiwan 's highest music award .
" It 's not that I 'm especially fond of music or culture , " says Yeh , who studied engineering in the last Japanese - era class of what became the National Taipei Institute of Technology .
" But my work in the recording industry brought me into contact with Peking opera , beiguan and nanguan music , and so forth .
I felt that those recordings were very educational and ought to be preserved . "
Yeh still regrets that he did n't have video equipment , so he could n't also make video records of folk music performances .
Back in the early 1950s the 24 - year - old Yeh worked with the Broadcasting Corporation of China to record albums of BCC singers on equipment the Japanese army had left behind .
He became a major player in the Taipei music industry .
" We recorded Tzu Wei 's first record , Green Island Tune , " says Yeh , half closing his eyes as he recalls those days .
" Who would have thought it would still be popular today ? "
Later Yeh established the Platinum Music recording studio and went abroad to keep up on the latest industry trends .
The first to bring multi-track stereo recording to Taiwan , he made a big contribution toward raising standards in the recording industry here .
Platinum is still going , run by senior recording engineer Yeh Chui - Ching , who is Yeh Chin - tai 's oldest son .
It is still one of Taiwan 's leading studios , having recorded such chart toppers as Luo Ta - yu 's " The Small Town Lukang " and Wang Chieh 's " A Game , a Dream , " as well as recent works by Chen Shan - ni .
Cigarette cases and plastic milk bottles
Although Yeh Chin - tai has worked in the recording industry , his field is really plastics and machinery .
After graduating from college , Yeh opened the Mingli Plastics Factory .
Their first product was a plastic cigarette case .
Back in those days farmers would always put cigarettes in their pockets when they went to the fields , but they would often find that their cigarettes would get crushed before they had a chance to smoke them .
Both the cases and the machines to make them sold well all over Taiwan .
Noting that glass baby bottles often cracked when boiled for sterilization , Yeh then came up with the idea of replacing glass with polyethylene .
His factory was the first in the world to produce plastic baby bottles .
Yeh also made the sterilizers , and both lines proved to be very profitable .
In was in this period that he met the owner of the factory across from his , who was a National Assembly member .
Through him , Yeh reestablished connections with BCC and once again threw himself into the recording industry .
Yeh recalls a " beautiful accident " : He bought a second - hand electroplater from a Japanese and tried to plate various plastic products with chrome so as to make them more resilient .
Only after repeated failures and much frustration did he think about electroplating his black plastic albums with nickel and copper to make them stronger .
This thrust him into the realm of media storage .
" The times change faster with each wave , " says Yeh .
He explains that it took 100 years after Edison invented phonograph records for something better - laser disks - to appear .
Their replacements , CDs and VCDs , are now cresting , soon to be vanquished by DVDs , which though next in line are already feeling mini-disks closing in on them .
Global CD - ROM wars
Competing in the information age , Yeh has seen industries rise and fall .
Resilient and flexible , he never recoils from challenges .
Back when CDs were still in their infancy , Yeh relied on his old relationship with Sony and found a team of engineers associated with the Industrial Technology Research Institute before he made a push into CD production .
Starting from simple pieces of compressed plastic , they went one step at a time , building a sturdy foundation of technical knowledge that Ritek still enjoys today .
In 1990 Ritek started to press CDs , becoming the first mass - production manufacturer of CDs in Taiwan .
Back then , it cost Japanese manufacturers about NT$ 80 to press one CD .
Ritek garnered market share by undercutting the competition and charging only NT$ 50 .
With the support that Yeh had long enjoyed in the recording industry here , Ritek was easily able to market its goods .
What really brought Ritek into the realm of high - technology was developing its own CD - Rs -LRB- recordable CDs -RRB- .
Taking a different tack from the Japanese , who were plating CD - Rs with a thin gold layer , Ritek instead developed a cheap and high - quality process for coating them with silver or aluminum .
These allowed for a much lower price that in turn created more demand .
It is yet another example of a Taiwanese company starting a global price war .
Marching forward
Being competitive in terms of price is one of Ritek 's strong points , but it 's not the whole story behind the company 's success .
Another important factor is that at key moments Yeh has not hesitated to invest the necessary sums when it was necessary to bring the technology to the next level .
" Ten years ago , when we first started producing CDs , one machine required five or six persons to operate , " Yeh recalls .
" When a flood of orders came in , we 'd have everyone working overtime with shifts going around the clock , but we still were n't able to keep up with demand .
That 's when the workers took the initiative to suggest that we automate . "
Now everything from ordering and production to storage and shipping is computerized .
One person is typically responsible for about 10 machines .
The whole process has been shortened , and quality is high .
The amount that the same 3,000 workers can produce has exploded from 200,000 a month to 200 million a month .
Automation has meant that the workers have had to learn how to operate sophisticated machinery and computers , so that Ritek has advanced out of the ranks of the traditional plastic disc pressers .
Automation has also allowed the company to lower costs at a time when the price of data storage media has been plummeting .
In the third quarter last year , the price of a CD - ROM suddenly fell from 60 US cents to 40 cents , which is n't far from the 30 cents it costs to make .
It 's a long way from the US$ 14 that they cost when they first hit the market five years ago .
Yet Ritek has still managed to maintain operating profits of 22 % , and the falling prices have n't crushed it .
The coming wave of technology will focus on light and small portable data devices such as PDAs and MP3 players , so the challenge for Ritek is allowing devices that are becoming smaller and smaller to have larger data capacities and higher fidelity .
Yeh points out that the patent rights for mini-discs are owned entirely by big Japanese companies , but Ritek is the only company manufacturing them .
Ritek is also part of a group -LRB- which includes Dataplay , Samsung and Toshiba -RRB- that is researching and developing a data storage device no larger than a wrist watch , as well as the applications for it .
Ritek will be responsible for the production of the disk .
A year and a half ago Ritek invested in the production of OLED -LRB- organic light - emitting diode -RRB- displays , which is yet another technology used in portable computing devices that relies on thin opto - electrical film application techniques .
Currently Ritek is the largest producer of OLEDs in the world .
Ritek has also begun to explore fiber optics used in the information industry .
Last year Ritek invested in production of fiber - optic connectors with Taiwan Memory Technology .
This one of the products Yeh is proudest of .
" In the future , when fiber optic applications mature , a house will need a dozen or so of these connectors , " Yeh says .
Currently , the fiber optic connectors being produced by TMT sell for US$ 7 a piece .
But they ca n't keep up with demand , so Yeh has gone to the mainland to establish more factories , where he has cast his eyes upon the vast mainland market .
On the topic of fiber optics and the internet , Yeh is particularly knowledgeable and incisive .
Whenever Yeh goes to Japan he happily brings back lots of Japanese books about economics and technology , such as those about third - generation mobile phones , hand - held devices and so forth .
" I study the concepts presented in these books , and then I use the viewpoint of a businessman to see if there would be any problems implementing them . "
Yeh has a house full of Japanese books and reads Japanese newspapers every day .
Working hard to get a grip on technological trends , he believes that only the far - sighted will end up winners .
He often cites the example of the owner of the Japanese fast food chain Yoshinoya , who predicted as early as 1980 , when there was a great US - Japan trade imbalance , that America would force Japan to open its beef market .
Taking hold of the opportunity , he bought a cattle ranch in America .
He had n't expected that strident protests from Japanese farmers would delay the market opening .
As a result , Yoshinoya struggled for many years and nearly went bankrupt .
For the past two years , however , Japan has been open to imported beef , and Yoshinoya has done very well .
And its chairman Matsuda has been elevated into the ranks of highly respected model Japanese entrepreneurs .
Early morning mountain wisdom
Possessing a corporate farsightedness and determination that is similar to Yoshinoya , Ritek has been groping its way toward international affirmation .
In October last year , Forbes Magazine selected 300 small companies around the world that it considered worth investing in .
Only two were chosen from Taiwan : Nien Hsing Textile and Ritek .
Then at the end of November Morgan Stanley decided to include Ritek in its index of Taiwan stocks .
Although these are tough times for the stock market here , and Ritek 's share price has tumbled along with other high - priced electronics companies , Yeh is very pleased to have received these kudos from abroad .
Getting on in years , Yeh turned over day - to - day responsibility for the business to his hard - nosed second son Yeh Chui - jing a decade ago .
Yeh Chin - tai still holds the position of chairman .
As diligent as ever , he still scurries back and forth between Taipei and the Hukou area of Hsinchu on a daily basis .
And he often flies to Australia , America , Japan and Britain to check out factories and investment trends .
" Going to work every day is a responsibility I owe myself , " says Yeh .
" It 's an expression of my will . "
With regard to his son 's strategic decisions , however , Yeh just observes and makes suggestions but tries not to interfere .
" If you want to cultivate a successor , you must tolerate mistakes , for he can only grow by making them for himself . "
By participating but not meddling , the old man gains peace of mind .
Yeh goes to bed every evening at 8:30 , and then rises at 4:00 before the sun comes up .
At 5:00 he goes to Yangmingshan and starts his walk up into the hills .
At 6:00 he reaches his destination and with some of his climbing buddies makes tea in a small farmhouse .
Then he peacefully awaits the dawn .
" You young people do n't often enjoy that peaceful mountain scenery ! "
Yeh embodies a pleasant combination of activity and tranquility that has helped Ritek to succeed .
His character projects a soft glow quite unlike the brash glare that typically surrounds the new " technobility . "

CD - ROMs , which are a kind of optical digital technology , are resistant to scratches and damage and thus offer an excellent long - term solution for storing sound and images .
Ritek has been a major force behind their pervasive adoption over the past decade .
p. 25
DVDs , which provide more than eight times the storage of VCDs , are becoming a hot audio - visual storage medium .
They will be the chief focus of Ritek 's next generation of products .

A Master of Ink and Stone
Calligrapher and Seal - Carver Wang Chiang - wei

The calligrapher and seal - carver Wang Chuang - wei spent a lifetime working assiduously at his craft , producing a body of work in which every single stroke and cut looks perfect .
Wang passed away three years ago , and this January a collection of 50 works , spanning every period of Wang 's life , went on display at the National Palace Museum in Taipei .
In recent years the museum , primarily known for its collection of treasures from the palaces of Ming and Qing dynasty China , has broadened its remit and begun acquiring newly excavated artifacts as well as 20th century calligraphy and painting - including works by such luminaries as Chang Ta - chien , Qi Baishi , Yu Yo - jen and Tai Ching - nung .
To those who knew him , the late calligrapher and seal - carver Wang Chuang - wei was simply " Old Chuang . "
He liked a drink , as his friends will testify , and stories of his drinking exploits are still told with relish .
Visitors to Wang 's home were generally greeted with something stronger than a cup of tea , and Wang , who claimed that alcohol stimulated the creative juices -LRB- giving the artist a sense of clarity and purpose -RRB- once penned the following couplet : Knocking back drink makes the poetry flow / A glass or two helps you find the right phrase .
Hsueh Chih - yang , who studied under Wang and is a master in his own right , recalls how Wang liked to open a bottle at lunchtime , and in fact produced much of his best work when he was half - cut .
Last of the scholar - artists
Wang 's son Wang Ta - chih , who heads the history of art department at Chinese Culture University 's graduate school of history , remembers that when he was small he really dreaded his dad reciting poetry .
Oftentimes the elder Wang ended up blubbering , before wiping away his tears and declaring : " Great poem ! "
But Wang Ta - chih credits his father for instilling in him a love of literature , and encouraging him to become proficient in traditional Chinese disciplines such as painting , chess , woodwind music and martial arts .
Says the younger Wang : " For me , my father was one of the last generation of Chinese scholar - artists ! "
Wang Chuang - wei was born in Hebei Province in 1909 , into an educated family - his father Wang Yi - pin was the last xiucai scholar - official of the Qing dynasty -LRB- 1644 - 1911 -RRB- .
But the son had no wish to become an official , and instead opted to spend his days at home , freely soaking up the atmosphere of art and culture .
He began tracing characters at age six , under his father 's direction , and when he was 12 he started learning how to carve seals .
His grandfather worked in Beijing , and every year brought back valuable calligraphic artifacts that he had purchased there .
Young Wang thus became familiar , from an early age , with the works and implements of prominent calligraphers from throughout the land .
At an age when other children were still busy at their games , Wang used to bury himself among books , for hours on end , in the family library .
Like all Chinese children , Wang began by imitating the firm and well - formed calligraphy of Yan Zhenqing .
He went on to learn the styles of many other masters of the art , progressing in his teens to the running script and grass script of the ancient master Wang Xizhi , which became central to his own calligraphic style .
Love and war
At age 20 Wang went to Beiping -LRB- as Beijing was then called -RRB- to study at the Jinghua School of Art , and like many other young Chinese at that time - when the cultures of East and West were first coming into close contact - he immersed himself in Western culture , learning all he could about Western painting , sculpture , film and literature .
However , perhaps due to his familiarity with what was best in Chinese art , Wang did n't take this interest in Western art any further .
Instead he opted for the life of the true Chinese man of letters .
In 1937 , following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident , Japan occupied Beiping and launched a full - scale invasion of China .
Newly betrothed , and with the sterling qualities of a typical northern lad , Wang enlisted in the army .
For three months he marched with an expeditionary force to the malaria - infested jungles of Burma , and then on to India , before making a safe return .
His young bride Chang Ming - sui , daughter of General Chang Jun - sheng , was of a similarly resolute character .
Unable to get news of Wang 's whereabouts she took herself , along with another young woman -LRB- who brought her baby son and was also seeking her husband -RRB- from Jiangxi Province to China 's southwest .
Now 87 years of age , Chang Ming - sui says : " Many years later I saw what he had written in his diary back then .
Though he had no news of me whatsoever , he guessed correctly that I would n't wait in the rear area with the other military families , and would n't go back to my parents ' home either .
I 'm still moved when I think how well he knew me . "
For Chang , Wang was the kind of man who considered things in depth but did n't express his thoughts openly .
" Grown man "
After moving to the unoccupied zone , Wang began carving seals in his spare time to support himself .
It was at this time that Wang adopted the moniker " Chuang - wei , " or " making it as a grown man " - an ironic nod to the Han dynasty writer Yang Xiong who once said : " Carving seals is boy 's work , it 's not for grown men . "
Wang Chuang - wei is how he has been known ever since , and to this day , few know that his original name was Wang Yuan - feng .
According to Hsueh Ping - nan , one of seven main disciples of the " Wang School " of seal carving , the art combines the skills of calligraphy , composition and carving , requiring not only a deep familiarity with ancient forms of script but also the ability to stretch and compress characters so as to fit them , neatly and cleverly , onto the compact head of a seal stone .
As an authority in the study of written characters , Wang was highly knowledgeable about different styles of seal script .
The 500 or so seals of his displayed in the collection Yuzhao Shanfang Yinxuan show how complete his mastery of the form was , from ancient guxi seals of state , to the qinyin and hanyin seals of the Qin and Han dynasties , and the styles of the oracle - bone - script and wanzhe schools .
From the horizontal and vertical strokes of hanyin script , to the snaky lines of small seal script , Wang performed all with equal facility .
Hsueh Ping - nan recalls how he once watched Wang carving seals in his study , first giving careful thought to the layout and making draft after draft on paper .
Having settled on a layout , he would then carve the seal in one go , using the knife with fluid ease .
Thus it was that he could fill the confined space on a seal with expansive , forceful - looking characters .
What people admired most about Wang was his ability to wield the knife like a writing brush , carving lines that seemed free and flowing .
Every stroke was made with one cut of the blade - in contrast to most seal carvers who need two cuts to achieve the appearance of a brush stroke .
This was especially so of his signature mark on the side of the seal .
Careful examination of Wang 's seals shows that the running script of the signature mark is carved with every bit as much grace and fluidity as if done by brush and ink , but augmented by the hardness that is intrinsic to stone inscriptions .
For individuality of seal - carving style , Wang ranks only behind the likes of Wu Chang - shuo and Qi Baishi
The Western artistic concepts that Wang absorbed in his youth opened his mind to creative possibilities within the tradition .
For example , he introduced unconventional themes for the knobs that he carved for his seals .
Chang Ming - sui picks up one tiny seal , half the length of a little finger , on which the knob is a vividly carved image of a dragon coiled around two seashells .
Says Chang : " This is one he made in Chongqing .
When I first saw it I wondered how anyone could carve something like that . "
Chang is herself an accomplished carver of seal knobs , and she knows the details and dates of all Wang 's seals and calligraphies .
Meeting her one ca n't help but feel that as his partner and soulmate , Chang must have had a lot to do with Wang 's success as an artist , and the long and happy life that he enjoyed .
Something new , something old
Wang passed away in his sleep at the ripe old age of 90 , and it is said in art circles that he died with a smile on his face .
His accomplishments as a calligrapher can be divided into several different phases of his life .
In Chongqing he came to know the well - known calligrapher Shen Yinmo , and it was under Shen 's direction that he began to expand his repertoire beyond the styles of the 3rd to 9th centuries , drawing on the natural elegance of noted calligraphers such as Zhao Mengfu -LRB- 1254 - 1322 -RRB- and Wen Zhengming -LRB- 1470 - 1559 -RRB- , to develop a neat , full style , with every character a beauty .
Ho Chuan - hsing , deputy researcher at the calligraphy and painting department of the National Palace Museum , explains that the art of Chinese calligraphy can broadly be divided into two main branches : the nantie , or Southern style , in which beauty of form is emphasized , and the more rugged beibei or Northern style .
Wang Chuang - wei established his style relatively early , and up until he was in his forties his works were characterized by the smooth , fluid forms of the nantie style .
However , Wang himself was alert to the risk of his calligraphy becoming over-refined , and he began incorporating the robustness of the beibei style into his brushwork , aiming for a style that was more " raw and intense . "
As a result , his calligraphy came to combine fluid grace with a core of doughty toughness .
It was a style well suited to the kind of man he was : a bluff northerner with the perfectionist 's approach to art .
When he was in his fifties Wang came to regard " writing characters " as a form of painting , and he began to innovate and experiment with the art .
For example , he created " multiple - shadow " calligraphy , in which characters were painted in five overlapping layers using different consistencies of ink .
He tried using deliberately crumpled paper to produce a mottled effect with the ink , and worked on a blurring effect , achieved by briefly dousing a freshly painted silk scroll in water .
Despite the interest generated among calligraphers by these innovations , Wang was more suited by temperament to the established forms , and he eventually turned back to ancients for inspiration .
He studied in detail the characters on the manuscripts and artifacts , dating back to the first millennium BC , that were at that time being unearthed at Mawangdui and other sites in mainland China , and began absorbing their distinctive forms into his own calligraphic style .
He also made poems and paired - couplets out of the ancient inscriptions , pioneering a personal " something new from something old " approach .
" During this period his running script was no longer as lean as it had been , " says Ho Chuan - hsing .
" It began slanting rightwards and spreading out a little .
Overall , his characters became more free and unconstrained , with swooping spaces where the brush was running dry of ink .
He had well and truly shaken off the earlier fixation with exquisite perfection . "
Lin Po - ting , deputy director of the National Palace Museum , who once studied under Wang at National Taiwan Normal University , says : " Wang Chuang - wei drew on traditional styles , but not in a cliched way .
In studying the calligraphy of ancient times he broke through limitations , one after another , so endowing his calligraphy with a simple , raw life - force . "
It was during this period that Wang 's calligraphic work reached its pinnacle .
Lifelong learner
Throughout his creative life Wang loved to drink , and he also loved books .
He was always reading , he liked buying and talking about books , and he was happy to make the acquaintance of other readers .
When students or friends of his traveled to Japan he used to ask them to bring back works on Japanese calligraphy , or books and magazines from mainland China .
This love of reading did n't wane at all in his later years , and when he found his memory failing he carved himself a seal with the exhortatory motto : " The more you forget the more you need to read . "
Wang , with his vast erudition and deep knowledge of painting , calligraphy , and inscriptions , was often sought out for his views by others in the field of art and culture .
For example , collectors often turned to Wang for an explanation of the deliberately obscure dedications that the great Chang Ta - chien like to write on his paintings .
Sometimes he would have a dig at his students , urging them to work harder in the future .
Huang Tien - tsai , who owns a collection of seals made by literati down the ages , recalls how he once asked Wang to re-inscribe an old seal Huang had picked up on an antiques stall .
Wang first asked : " Are you sure you want the original inscription ground off ? "
Without thinking twice about it , Huang said yes .
Only when Huang came to collect it did Wang tell him that the re-inscribed seal , which originally read : " Roaming in nature makes the man , " formerly belonged to the late - Qing reformer Kang Youwei .
Huang was left fuming .
Forgetting the self
When he was in his sixties Wang began to use the style names Jianzhai -LRB- " steadily more abstinent " -RRB- and Jiansou -LRB- " steadily older " -RRB- , and carved a seal for himself with the inscription : " Steadily older and more mature , steadily more mature and more detached , steadily more detached and closer to what is plain and natural . "
During his fifties he had passed through a period of experimentation and innovation , " being different for the sake of it , " but now he returned to the traditional artistic way of " being naturally different . "
Wang once said that an artistic aesthetic is something that emerges through long years of stylistic refinement and expression .
Every artist goes through a non-stop process of evolution , accumulating a kind of natural grace as time goes by .
If old age enabled Wang to become " steadily more proficient " - as Buddhism would have it - at his art , it also made him " steadily more forgetful . "
Sometimes , when tidying up works of poetry from years before , he would come across one that he had no recollection of ever writing .
This did n't depress him , however .
On the contrary , he considered it an advantage of memory loss that it enabled him to look more objectively at his own works , as if someone else had written them .
With this in mind he came up with another style name for himself : " Forgetful old man . "
Eventually he came to forget almost everything that had ever happened to him , both the sorrows and the joys .
After a lifetime dedicated to the pursuit of art , Wang at last entered that state of freedom in which " the man and his calligraphy have both attained maturity . "
When Wang was young he once wrote the following lines on seeing the work of an ancient master at firsthand : " Ink from the brush of a master gives one the sensation of seeing something that is living and breathing , flesh and blood .
One almost feels in the presence of the calligrapher , as if meeting him ' face to face . ' "
Wang 's calligraphy is still everywhere to be seen on the streets of Taipei , in the form of the signs for such institutions as the Kungpao Building , Taipei Teachers ' Meeting Hall , Taiwan Land Bank , and the Chunghwa Bookstore .
The exhibition of Wang 's calligraphy and seal carvings , spanning every period of his creative career , runs at the National Palace Museum in Taipei from January 20 until April 15 .
It 's a great opportunity to come " face to face "

Taipei City :
Sweating in the Spotlight
Recently the Taipei City Department of Urban Development announced their idea for a " Taipei Citizen 's Passport . "
Who is their idea of a typical Taipei Citizen ?
The answer is an environmentally conscious , culture - loving person who has a soft spot in their heart for good causes - someone who reads several books a month , recycles , takes mass transit , donates blood , does volunteer work , plants flowers on their balcony and cleans their building 's exterior walls .
That 's who !
This " passport , " with its middle - class and decidedly Western sensibility , is just one example of how Taipei differs from other places in Taiwan .
Not long after Chen Shui - bian ascended to the ROC presidency , the Office of the President began to come into sharp conflict with Taipei City Hall .
They clashed over whether to build a domed stadium , over how to allocate government funds , over which romanization system should be employed to transcribe Chinese characters , and even over whether the mayor was showing the president proper respect .
These conflicts have caused Taipei City to become isolated from Taiwan 's other cities and counties .
What exactly is at the heart of these disputes ?
Is there a north - south divide between Taipei and the other counties and cities ?
And are the calls of " Taipei first " and of " Taiwan first " mutually reinforcing or mutually exclusive ?
Taipei 's wealth and high status as the capital have long been a sore spot with many people living elsewhere in Taiwan .
Some argue that Taiwan ought to be divided into four counties by the Chuoshui River and the Central Mountain Range , with financial resources being equitably divided to create uniform levels of development in each .
Others question whether the central government should be located at the northern tip of the island , making it difficult to reach for civil servants and regular citizens alike .
Why not instead move the capital to Taichung , they suggest .
Since the Taiwan provincial government was largely disbanded two years ago , the 21 counties and cities of Taiwan have been directly under the ROC central government .
With the election of Chen Shui - bian , the ROC is now under the control of the Democratic Progressive Party -LRB- DPP -RRB- , as are many of Taiwan 's other cities and counties , including Kaohsiung , which like Taipei enjoys special status as a " self - governing municipality . "
Whereas the south was Chen 's principal source of votes , the blue of the KMT holds sway in Taipei , making the city a thorn in the side of the ruling DPP and threatening its privileged position .
In July the city and the central government quarreled over how much money the city would be allotted in the national budget , and the city 's share was cut by NT$ 6 billion .
Then in October the Executive Yuan lowered the population requirement for self - governing status , and Taichung City joined Taipei and Kaohsiung as a special self - administered municipality .
Various other large cities and counties also hope to achieve this so as to enjoy the same status as Taipei .
The goose that lays the golden eggs
Is Taipei really specially blessed ?
Why is it the focus of so much attention , of so much envy and jealousy ?
Perhaps the following figures can help shed some light on this matter :
The Taipei Basin holds 12 % of the island 's population on only 0.8 % of its land , yet it has one - sixth of the nation 's high schools , one - third of its universities , and 54 % of its cultural activities .
At least 75 % of all medium and large international conferences in Taiwan are held in Taipei .
More than 90 % of multinationals in Taiwan have their headquarters in Taipei .
And among the 100 largest domestic companies , more than 70 are registered in the city and pay their business taxes there .
Of the remaining , 10 can be found in the Hsinchu Science Park .
Whereas numerous factories are spread throughout central and southern Taiwan , most are just producing for somewhere else .
For these areas , a Taiwanese expression captures the situation pretty well :
" The hens produce droppings but lay no eggs . "
As far as the distribution of government largess is concerned , in 1998 government expenditures in Taipei City ran to about NT$ 176 billion -
that 's three times more than in Kaohsiung City and more than in Taichung City , Miaoli County , Taichung County , Changhua County , Nantou County and Yunlin County combined .
Those six localities only received NT$ 120 billion in total .
If expenditures were divided evenly among all the residents of Taipei City , each would receive NT$ 68,000 , far above the NT$ 42,000 for the residents of Kaohsiung , the NT$ 25,000 for residents of Tainan City or the NT$ 17,000 for the residents of Taipei County .
In light of this discrepancy , it 's no wonder that the other counties and cities angrily look upon the residents of Taipei as " first - class citizens " who live in the lap of luxury , while taking everyone else for a ride .
These first - class citizens really do run through money like water .
If you want to see how , you could start with Taipei 's Mass Rapid Transit -LRB- MRT -RRB- system , which is the world 's most expensive at NT$ 440 billion ; the Kuandu Nature Reserve , for which Japanese experts were hired to perform wetlands restoration to the tune of NT$ 14 billion ; the West Gate District reconstruction carried out in conjunction with the building of the MRT there , which came to more than NT$ 10 billion ; the Mucha Zoo , which has consumed NT$ 30 billion since it was built in the 1970s ; or the building of the Taipei Financial Center , which will stand 101 stories high , serve as an Asian landmark , and cost the city as much as NT$ 10 billion .
Two heads , north and south
This easy - come , easy - go attitude toward money has long been a characteristic of Taipei .
Ever since Liu Mingchuan founded Taipei in the late Qing dynasty , rule over Taiwan has switched from nation to nation .
Yet no matter who was in control , Taipei has not been shaken from its position as the island 's center of government .
Nevertheless , " It has only been ten some years that Taipei has really left the others in the dust , " argues Hsia Chu - joe , a professor at NTU 's Graduate Institute of Building and Planning .
Hsia points out that although the Governor - General 's Residence was located in Taipei during Japanese rule , in the agricultural Taiwan of that period , the Japanese colonial administration was concerned about rice and sugar production over the entire Western Plain and treated all the cities about the same .
Moreover , at the end of the Japanese era , Japan began to put even more emphasis on Kaohsiung as a base for its advances into the South Pacific .
This gave the impetus for Kaohsiung later developing into an " industrial port city . "
When the ROC took over , government power returned to the Governor - General 's Residence in Taipei , which became the Presidential Palace .
Although Taipei remained the political and economic center , Kaohsiung remained as an important center of heavy industry .
Export processing zones established in the 1960s in Nantzu and Chienchen attracted people from all over southern Taiwan .
In the 1970s , during the era of the Ten Construction Projects , both China Shipbuilding and China Steel chose to locate in Kaohsiung .
At one point , the city 's port was the busiest in the world , as it sent products " Made in Taiwan " across the seven seas .
It thus made a pivotal contribution to Taiwan 's " economic miracle . "
With the rise of industry in Kaohsiung , the agricultural counties of central and southern Taiwan began to lag behind , but at least there was a minimal kind of balance on the island as a whole with " two heads , one north and one south . "
And to some degree the provincial government 's location in Nantou - and the resulting stream of visiting city and county bureaucrats - meant that central Taiwan was n't all that forlorn .
Taichung and Kaohsiung step out !
Well then , when did Taipei really start to pull ahead ?
And why ?
Hsia Chiu - joe explains that the late 1980s were an important turning point .
The rapid appreciation of the NT dollar necessitated a shift from the labor - intensive production on which the island had depended .
Japanese and Western manufacturers left , and even Taiwanese companies began to pull up their stakes and move their factories to Southeast Asia and mainland China .
What 's more , there was a growing environmental consciousness that led the residents of central and southern Taiwan to start opposing industrial projects .
Ten years ago the town of Lukang in Changhua County told Du Pont to look elsewhere , and three years ago Taichung County refused to allow Bayer to build a plant there .
As a result , other multinationals planning major investment projects stopped even considering Taiwan . "
In fact , what Kaohsiung people want most of all is the ' three direct links ' with mainland China , " says Huang Jung - feng , the director - general of Taipei 's Department of Reconstruction , who worked for the Kaohsiung City government for many years .
" With regularly scheduled flights , Kaohsiung could turn itself into an international port led by its service industries . "
Likewise , Lai Cheng - i , chairman of the Taiwan Province Association of Real Estate Investors , which is headquartered in Central Taiwan , recalls that ten years ago the Taichung city government drew up a new plan for the city that called for straight , broad avenues .
Many businesses were privately expecting that the Port of Taichung would be able to establish direct shipping links with the mainland , and were even hoping to attract " red capital " from across the strait .
They had visions of Taichung establishing important links to the Asia Pacific or even to the global community .
Much to these cities ' frustration , for ten years there has been no progress on the " three direct links . "
Kaohsiung and Taichung have excellent ports , but they are like besieged cities with nowhere to go .
Three years ago the Tuntex Building was completed in Kaohsiung .
At 81 stories it is one of the tallest skyscrapers in Asia .
Yet a series of rumors circling about its precarious financial status have turned it into a symbol of Kaohsiung 's falling fortunes .
High - tech corridor
While southern and central Taiwan have fallen on hard times , Taipei City has taken full advantage of the 1990s trend toward globalized production .
" There is first of all Taipei 's position of importance both for the economy and for government , and the thriving science park in Hsinchu , " explains Hsia Chu - chiu , who is a professor of architecture and urban planning at NTU .
" To these you add the international airport in Taoyuan and the construction of the second northern highway , and what you get is a ' high - tech corridor ' from Taipei to Hsinchu . "
Hsia points out that this corridor extends overseas , eastward to California 's Silicon Valley and westward to the production bases in the Pearl and Yangtze river deltas on the mainland .
Taipei , however , plays a pivotal role in the middle , linking all the parts together .
" If you eat somewhere like the Agora Garden Conference Center , you 'll hear people all around you saying things like , ' Have you been abroad recently ? ' or ' I 've just come back from overseas , ' " says Yang Ting - yuan , the former general manager of Winbond Electronic 's semiconductor subsidiary .
The outstanding performance of Northern Taiwan 's high - tech corridor is driving the Taiwan economy and widening the gap between north and south .
Given this situation , where is there leverage to bring about a better balance between north and south ?
Any such attempt will hinge upon the central government working to redistribute wealth - to take from rich Taipei and give to its poor country cousins .
How much would such action actually help ?
Although redirecting some of the billions appropriated for Taipei City would do little to fundamentally change the economic disparity , many experts believe that it would at least serve as a comforting gesture to the various counties and cities crying for help .
But it would not get to the root of the problem .
" If you really want to help those cities and counties , then you 've got to implement ' local self - rule , ' so that the local governments -LRB- which are now only tertiary government units -RRB- really acquire sufficient power and money , " argues Hsia Chu - joe .
Otherwise , if the " southern science park " that is now being built in Tainan County is successful , perhaps it , in combination with the " three direct links " and the high - speed railway will create new opportunity for central and southern Taiwan .
Knowing New York better than Hualien
A city can thrive or wilt in response to political and economic changes to a nation .
These developments can even slowly and silently change its basic character .
Taipei 's character is much different than those of other Taiwanese cities .
" In attitude , Taipei is like a different country from central and southern Taiwan , " observes Chen Tung - sheng , chairman of NTU 's sociology department , and a member of the Democratic Progressive Party 's brain trust .
First of all , while most counties and cities regard the central government as the boss and Taipei as the imaginary enemy , only Taipei has an " international outlook . "
Chen points out that every year more than 900,000 residents of Taipei - or more than 30 % of its population - travel overseas .
Hsinchu comes in second at 28 % .
By way of comparison , only 6 % of Tainan residents and 5.4 % of Kaohsiung residents go abroad every year .
Every winter and summer vacation Chen 's kids go overseas to study English .
But the Chens are just another middle - class yuppie family in Taipei .
" Taipei youth may well know more about the latest fashions in Tokyo and New York than about Yunlin or Hualien , " notes Chen .
You can see one example after another of how Taipei has its eyes on the world and fingers on the global pulse .
At the beginning of September , the Taipei City government broke new ground by sponsoring a gay pride festival .
It even invited Michael Bronski , a leader of the gay pride movement in the United States .
The event was fiercely opposed by the Presbyterian church and other groups in Taiwan , but it clearly earned points with foreigners who participated enthusiastically and saw it as an embrace of tolerance and diversity .
" The fact is that Taiwan puts a lot of effort every year into providing foreign assistance and sending the head of state overseas , but we forget that we engage in foreign relations with our everyday actions , " says Cheng Tsun - chi , who is director of Taipei 's Bureau of Labor Affairs .
More than 30,000 foreign workers , mostly Filipino or Indonesian nannies and nurses , live in Taipei .
" About 10,000 of these foreign domestics leave every year when their contracts expire .
If these 10,000 people dislike Taiwan , their opinions will get passed around by word of mouth when they return home .
What hope will there then be for Taiwan 's foreign relations ? "
Last year Cheng Tsun - chi put on a big event for foreign workers , and this year he has created an English newsletter for foreign workers .
Says Cheng : " Guests from afar should be treated with respect - not only to show that Taipei is serious about becoming an international city , but also because these visitors are one of the links Taipei has to other international cities . "
Not losing face for the nation
" Taipei is under a lot of pressure because it faces international competition , " says William Chen , the head of Taipei 's Bureau of Urban Development .
When multinationals are deciding where to put their regional headquarters they make city - to - city comparisons .
Last December the English - language magazine Asia Week made a list of Asian cities that put Taipei and Osaka in a tie for second place among the most livable cities in Asia , behind only Fukuoka .
Taipei was up three places from the year before .
Nevertheless , since the chart changes year to year , Taipei could slip in the future if it is n't careful .
" Taipei is struggling to catch up with Tokyo , Singapore and Hong Kong , and it has cities like Shanghai , Beijing , and Bangkok running fast on its heels , " says Chen .
Chen points out that with the PRC lavishing resources on Shanghai , the city was able to complete its highway and put its electric cables underground in just two years .
It was even able to lay down an entire fiber optic network .
" In terms of quality and diversity , Taipei is ahead , but it 's a step behind when it comes to bringing out the pickaxes for an infrastructure project , " Chen admits .
For instance , there has long been talk about installing a proper sewage treatment system in Taipei , but currently only 43 % of Taipei homes are connected to it .
The sewage from most Taipei homes pours out , untreated , into rivers .
The capitals of the advanced Western nations would never have allowed such a situation to persist .
The residents of Taipei regard themselves as citizens of the " global village , " and are confident in facing international challenges .
As a result , they find it hard to accept the current government 's " Taiwan - first " orientation and its focus on the " native soil . "
Recently , there has been a big controversy about which romanization system to use for writing Chinese characters in English .
The ROC government insists on casting aside the Hanyu Pinyin system that has been used on the mainland and around the world for many years and instead adopting the Tongyong Pinyin system , which has been specially created by a Taiwanese scholar .
This has raised the hackles of Lung Ying - tai , the director of the Taipei Bureau of Culture : " The new government can not try to lock up the nation .
It can not put the elimination of pan-Chinese influences as the starting point for all its thinking ! "
Not talking the talk
With its international orientation , Taipei also has a much different attitude than other counties and cities , especially southern ones , when it comes to the issue of independence versus reunification .
" Over 30 % of Taipei 's population is made up of mainlanders [ those who fled the Chinese Communists , and their descendants ] , " explains Chen Tung - sheng .
" This figure is much higher than the 13 % average in the nation . "
The mainlanders have introduced the cuisines of their home provinces and a longing for the old country .
Likewise , the attitudes of civil servants loyal to the KMT have also taken firm root in Taipei .
What 's more , a larger proportion of Hakkas live in Taipei than any place outside of their traditional bases in the countryside , and the city also has a large community of aborigines .
With this population structure , the Taiwanese chauvinism so prevalent in southern Taiwan is rather rare in Taipei .
Oddly , as Taipei has gone out of its way to establish ties with the international community and trade with mainland China , it has , whether by intention or not , created distance between itself and the rest of Taiwan .
Chen Tung - sheng , who grew up in Shalu , Taichung County and has a strong Taiwanese consciousness , remarks that you simply ca n't get by without speaking Taiwanese south of the Chuoshui River .
Only in Taipei do people dare to " eat Taiwanese , but not speak Taiwanese . "
Both in terms of language and national identity , there is a clear " split between north and south . "
To take the simplest example , current ROC president Chen Shui - bian had an outstanding record as mayor of Taipei .
Moreover , he wore the mantle of being a " Taiwanese native son . "
In any other county or city , his re-election would have been a sure thing .
But in the 1998 mayoral election , he lost by more than 100,000 votes to Ma Ying - jeou , whose parents came over from the mainland .
The year that he lost , Chen magnanimously said , " a first - rate city is bound to be a very picky city . "
He did so to show that he bore no grudge , but perhaps his statement was also a harbinger of the current animosity between the President 's Office and City Hall .
New hometown
In the eyes of the other counties and cities , Taipei may stand alone , but Taipei people themselves struggle with their sense of identity .
" Taipei is a classic immigrant city , whose citizens form a ' motley crew , ' " says Tseng Shu - cheng , head of the Urban Reconstruction Organization and an associate professor of architecture at Tamkang University .
" Its citizens may all earn their living here , but they do n't share collective memories , and they lack any bonds of affection to the city or ties to personal networks here . "
In a survey he conducted several years ago , Tseng found that only one in five Taipei residents were born there .
" Ask somebody in Taipei where they are from , and seven out of ten will say they are mainlanders or are from Tainan , Pingtung , Penghu or wherever .
They are practically always from somewhere else ! "
In Tseng 's view the coming decade will be key to determine whether the city can transform itself from a " city of immigrants and migrants " to a " city of residents . "
He is currently promoting a community development plan in the hope that neighborhoods full of strangers can pull together , and people living in Taipei can begin to regard it as their " new hometown . "
But does Tseng himself consider Taipei to be his " new hometown " ?
" As a matter of fact , I feel very conflicted , " he admits .
" If I do n't move back to my hometown within five years , I 'll probably never return . "
Tseng , who strongly identifies with Tainan County as the place where he grew up , goes back every month to visit his parents .
In his hometown there are 20,000 people , and only two elementary schools and one junior high school .
There , if a neighbor is n't a relative , he 's probably an old school chum or co-worker .
You really get a hometown feeling in a place like that .
But can Tainan provide him with career opportunities ?
Wo n't his children lose the educational race before it even begins ?
He has seen a syndrome play out there : people 's parents die , and then they sell their farmland , let their family home go to ruin , pull up their stakes and move to Taipei .
Because he knows that his hometown needs people like him to come back and work on its behalf , he really feels torn .
Missions impossible
" While many cities and counties want to rediscover their old sense of self , Taipei wants to invent a self - identity that it never had , " explains Tseng , getting at the crux of the difference .
And so , at the beginning of the year before last , Taipei City began instituting a system of " community planning masters . "
These unpaid volunteers selected by City Hall gather suggestions and criticisms from residents and communicate with the elected neighborhood chiefs .
Then , after establishing concrete plans , they can apply to the city for financial assistance to implement them .
The goal is to get the citizens involved , so that they can help create a Taipei that they feel belongs to them .
" Over the past two years , we have discovered that Taipei City is not nearly as cold and lonely as we had once imagined , " says William Chen with excitement .
In order to expand participation , the city 's Urban Development Department this year has begun to train " seed planning masters . "
Two - thirds of the 48 " seed students " are professionals , including seven who have doctorates .
The high quality of people in Taipei has startled Chen , who worked for a long time in the provincial government .
The people of Taipei can be proud of their high level of education and earnings and their discipline .
When Chen Shui - bian was mayor he launched a major campaign against the sex industry , enforced laws against drinking and driving , and required motorcycle drivers to wear helmets .
Even Taipei residents themselves were surprised at their ability to accept such high standards .
Since Ma Ying - jeou has taken over as mayor the city has required its citizens to take on another duty , which was formerly regarded as a " mission impossible " : recycling in conjunction with using high - priced officially approved garbage bags .
Starting in July of this year , most Taipei residents , who identify themselves as being environmentally conscious , have complied and now separate their garbage .
One big family
" Although Taipei City has excellent financial resources and special qualities , please do n't exaggerate these differences , " cautions Ou Chin - te , the assistant mayor for government services .
" And it 's even more important not to allow political or party differences to create a situation where regions clash or go their own ways . "
The element of the Taiwan experience that is most worthy of the nation 's pride is the relatively even distribution of wealth and resources .
While Taipei has National Taiwan University and National Chengchi University , distant Nantou has National Chi Nan University and Chiayi has Chung Cheng University , both of which also have first - rate faculties and curriculums .
What 's more , " Though people in Ilan and Hualien may earn less money and have fewer facilities and less variety of activities , they also enjoy a lower cost of living , a more relaxed pace of life and clean air , " notes Ou .
Different cities serve different functions .
They ca n't be expected to be similar in every respect .
Compared to many developing countries , where one city often stands far above the others , Taipei 's advantages are really not that remarkable .
Tseng Shu - cheng notes that the areas close to the train stations in Shanghai and Guangzhou are thronged with illiterates looking for work and that beggars can be found on virtually any street in Jakarta .
These scenes are the result of great poverty in the countryside .
Farmers have no choice but to come to the cities and struggle at the bottom for the crumbs of the wealthy .
Even in Japan , an advanced industrial nation , Tokyo is 4.6 times as large as Osaka , the next biggest city .
Linking arms
The people of Taipei are not unaware of their advantages and distance from the " native soil . "
When Lung Ying - tai took over as head of Taipei 's Cultural Affairs Bureau , her first move was to invite other local culture officials to a meeting .
Lung says that Taipei very much wants to share its resources and experiences with other cities and counties .
Whether holding an international cultural event or setting the city 's cultural policies , she always asks for the participation or input of other cities and counties .
Next year , Taipei wants to hold an " Asian City Cultural Summit . "
Already 21 counties and cities in Taiwan have signed on as co-sponsors .
The " Taipei experience " can be used beneficially .
Yet the long - standing differences between Taipei and other localities , as well as the differences in ruling parties , get in the way .
Seven southern counties and cities have formed a political league centered around Kaohsiung .
Taipei , on the other hand , ca n't even get along with Taipei County , which completely surrounds it .
Ou Chin - te admits that Taipei has hardly any high - level ties to other cities and counties .
The city is like a lonely island or a proud and arrogant peacock , fated always to be alone .
This is Taipei 's pain , for sure .
But is it not also Taiwan 's loss ?
After the Handover : Taiwan - Macau Relations in the New Millennium
Last year , nearly one million travelers from Taiwan passed through Macau Airport , heading for mainland China or visiting Macau itself , and accounting for 80 % of passengers using the airport .
Around 1,000 of Macau 's civil servants have studied in Taiwan , and every year some 30,000 people travel from Macau to Taiwan for business or work , along with more than 400 students .
But against the backdrop of continued proclamations from the PRC about how " Macau 's ' one country two systems ' arrangement sets an example for solving the Taiwan problem , " these figures , along with the Taiwan - Macau exchanges that they represent , have been willfully neglected by Macau 's mainstream media .
Macau and Taiwan : so near and yet so far .
What are the connections that bind these two places , and what are the opportunities for new developments in the wake of the 1999 handover ?
On December 19 , 1999 , the eve of Macau 's transfer of sovereignty , the China Times in Taiwan published a survey on the Taiwanese public 's views about Macau 's return to Chinese control .
According to the survey , 31 % of people in Taiwan were n't even aware that Macau was about to be handed back to China , while 53 % answered that they did n't know whether the handover would be beneficial or harmful for Macau 's development .
But when asked whether the " one country two systems " formula , as used for Hong Kong and Macau , was acceptable for Taiwan , 59 % responded " No , " while 27 % said that they did n't know .
As these results clearly indicate , the people of Taiwan still know little about Macau , in spite of existing exchanges , and more than half of them flatly reject Beijing 's " one country two systems " formula - so readily taken up in Macau - as a solution to the Taiwan question .
Conveniently connected
It takes just an hour and a half to fly from Taiwan to Macau .
As Macau University professor Wong Hon Keong says , " You can get there and back in a day .
You catch the first flight to Macau in the morning , stop at the Westin for a coffee and to talk business , head to one of the outlying islands in the afternoon for a round of golf , take a stroll downtown , and return to Taiwan that evening . "
But in spite of the convenience for travelers , ties between the two places have been practically invisible for several decades .
What path will the relationship follow now that Macau has returned to China ?
As you pass through the offices of the Macau government 's directorate of administration you notice the relative youth of the staff , most of whom seem to be in their thirties .
Rosa Tam , who heads the recruitment and selection division of the directorate 's human resources department , introduces many of her colleagues with the remark that he or she " studied in Taiwan too . "
Tam herself graduated from the department of educational psychology at National Taiwan Normal University in 1985 , and joined Macau 's department of education in 1987 , before eventually moving to the directorate of administration and rising to the post of division chief in just 11 years .
Tam is just one of the many Macau civil servants who have studied for degrees in Taiwan .
The Macau government 's directorate for administration says that around 200 Macau civil servants have academic qualifications from Taiwan , but according to Taiwan 's representative office in the territory , the figure is closer to 1,000 .
This may not represent a very large share of Macau 's 17,000 civil servants , but given that many of those who graduated in Taiwan hold senior ranks , it adds something of a " Taiwan flavor " to the government of the Macau SAR -LRB- Special Administrative Region -RRB- .
In contrast , Taiwan alumni are noticeable by their absence from the SAR government in Hong Kong .
At present , the most senior government official to have studied in Taiwan is Ou Wenlong , who graduated in mechanical engineering at National Taiwan University -LRB- NTU -RRB- .
Ou is Macau 's secretary for transportation and public works , and has been appointed by Chief Executive Edmund Ho as one of the SAR government 's five administration secretaries .
Amid all the hype surrounding Macau 's incorporation under the " one country two systems " formula , the sensitive issue of the " Taiwan connection " within the Macau government is little discussed .
As the clearest example of this connection , Ou Wenlong is one official that many journalists from Taiwan have tried to get an interview with , but their requests have all been turned down on the grounds that the secretary is " too busy . "
He did nevertheless find time to do an interview with Hong Kong 's Phoenix TV , during which he discoursed freely on the subject of Macau 's development .
Sinorama applied , in line with official procedure , for a press pass to the handover ceremony , but the application was eventually rejected as " unapproved by the security department . "
On the eve of the handover , the signboard of the Taipei Trade and Tourism Office in Macau was quietly taken down , after the office had been privately warned to remove the sign before the transfer of sovereignty .
Office director William Li was subsequently reprimanded by the Mainland Affairs Council for his handling of the affair .
None of the above was problems at the time of Hong Kong 's handover in 1997 , which goes to show how cautious the Macau SAR government is regarding Taiwan .
When senior Macau officials are asked about having studied in Taiwan , they are always quick to add mention of other academic qualifications obtained in Macau , Lisbon , or mainland China .
" It 's called sanitizing your record ! " quips Tan Zhiqiang , Hong Kong and Macau bureau chief for the China Times , who was born and raised in Macau and wrote his doctoral dissertation on " The Question of Macau 's Sovereignty . "
The more senior a government official is , the more defensive he is likely to be on the subject of his studies in Taiwan .
" It does n't matter where you studied and where you graduated , " says Chen Mingying , a senior official in the Macau government 's news department .
Competence and professionalism are what the government requires from its personnel .
Another graduate of a Taiwan institution declares bluntly that he only spent four years in Taiwan getting his degree , and the place had virtually no effect on him at all .
Nevertheless , there has been a steady stream of students from Macau to Taiwan ever since 1955 .
According to statistics from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission , around 6,000 have come in the past ten years , and Professor Wong Hon Keong of Macau University 's Macau Research Center says that 30 % of middle school graduates in the territory have sat the overseas enrolment test for college in Taiwan .
Around 600 candidates passed the test last year , and there are on average 1,600 - 2,000 students from Macau at university in Taiwan at any one time .
" Semi-liberated area "
Perhaps the reason for the apparent lack of attachment to Taiwan among the many returned Taiwan alumni can be traced to historical factors .
In 1966 , Macau was convulsed by rioting in which several people were shot and killed by Portuguese security forces .
The enclave 's left - wing groups , which were closely allied with Beijing , took advantage of the situation to get KMT organizations in Macau shut down and their people expelled .
Ever since , Macau has been regarded in certain circles in Taiwan as a " semi-liberated area . "
But if Macau 's pro-Beijing forces are that strong , how come so many students come to Taiwan to get their degrees ?
" There are historical reasons for this too , " says Ou Jinrong , former president of Macau 's Taiwan Alumni Association and a member both of the Macau SAR 's first Selection Committee , and its Preparatory Committee .
Prior to the 1980s , Macau lacked its own colleges , and students had to go overseas for higher education .
Also , colleges on the mainland did n't start enrolling overseas students until the mid-1980s , while it was difficult to gain admission to university in Hong Kong .
Under these circumstances , Taiwanese universities , which actively recruited abroad , were a natural choice for many Macau students .
" In terms of the return you get on your investment , taking your degree in Taiwan is well worth it , " says Wang Yun , acting head of the sanitation and environment division of Macau 's urban administration office , who graduated in civil engineering from National Cheng Kung University -LRB- NCKU -RRB- in Tainan .
Taiwan 's universities have good teachers and decent facilities , says Wang , and students from Macau can learn much in Taiwan that will benefit them in their careers .
Unlike the colonial administration in Hong Kong , the government of Macau under the Portuguese recognized academic credentials issued by Taiwanese institutions .
It was only in the mid-1980s , once the timetable for the handover of Hong Kong and Macau had been agreed , that the government began to localize the civil service in preparation for the transition to " Macau people running Macau . "
A number of graduates who had returned from Taiwan to work in the private sector then shifted to government jobs , and have come to form an influential part of the administration .
" Little prawns grow into big lobsters if there are no fish in the sea , " smiles Leong Kam Chun , who graduated in business administration from NTU in 1973 .
Compared with the many Macau students who went to the mainland to study from the mid-1980s onwards , those who graduated in Taiwan returned and joined the civil service earlier , and seem to have made faster progress in their careers .
" There 's no denying that Taiwan universities have given us a good education , " smiles Leong Hong Sai , secretary of Macau 's Taiwan Universities Alumni Association .
In addition to the government officials who studied in Taiwan , many returned graduates have become influential in Macau through their success in the private sector .
Leong Kam Chun , for instance , one of the territory 's first group of professional accountants , has also served on the legislative council and is a member of the Macau SAR Selection Committee .
Leong Man Io , current president of the Taiwan Universities Alumni Association , who graduated in civil engineering from NCKU , is one of Macau 's most prominent civil engineers .
He has supervised several major projects such as landscaping Macau 's Maritime Museum and setting up venues for the handover events .
Unlike neighboring Hong Kong in 1997 , there was no public backlash in Macau on the occasion of the handover , and no exodus of emigrants .
Everything seemed smooth and orderly .
But the people 's primary concern was whether or not the incoming SAR administration would be capable of tackling difficult problems left behind by the Portuguese , particularly economic recession and declining public order .
The three " localizations " - of civil administration , the law , and official language - have become a focus of public discussion .
Concern has been expressed that responsibility has been passed to local administrators too late , and that they are too young and inexperienced - statistics from the department of civil service reveal that 61 % of government officials are 40 or under - to deal effectively with problems facing the newly established SAR .
Leong Kam Chun says : " Hong Kong began nurturing local administrative talent in the mid-1970s , whereas Macau only started doing so ten years later , in the mid-1980s .
" Several problems have already begun to emerge , such as the question of " legal localization . "
Gary Mei , executive director of the Sino - Latino Foundation of Macau , points out that during their four centuries in Macau the Portuguese never attempted to build up the Portuguese language ability of the local people .
Few Chinese have ever mastered Portuguese , and there are not many people who understand both Western law and the Chinese language .
This presents enormous difficulties for the localization into Chinese of Macau 's mass of colonial era laws .
Due to the chronic dearth of qualified personnel among Macau 's judiciary , much of the work of legal localization depends on experts from the mainland .
But according to Gary Mei , " The socialist law that they are used to on the mainland is out of synch with the capitalist - type law of Macau , in terms both of attitude and spirit . "
But legal professionals who have studied in Taiwan , where legal concepts are closer to those that hold in Macau , can play an important role in this localization process .
Communication bridge
From Taiwan 's perspective , how can these Taiwan alumni benefit the Taiwan - Macau relationship ?
As one of the alumni explains , this is an issue that does n't need to be addressed too directly : with a network of personal connections , the right kind of communication follows naturally .
Ou Jinrong frankly notes that Yue Meizhen , former vice-director of the Taiwan Affairs section of the Hong Kong branch of Xinhua Agency , once encouraged the alumni to " do more to be a bridge between the two sides . "
And in April , Taiwan 's Mainland Affairs Council invited members of the Taiwan Universities Alumni Association on a visit back to Taiwan , " to hear our views on Taiwan - Macau relations , " says Leong Hong Sai .
Wong Hon Keong , deputy director of the Macau Research Center at Macau University , says that the presence of these Taiwan alumni in Macau " makes it easier for the Taiwanese to get things done , " and he feels that this is an asset for Taiwan in terms of developing relations with Macau .
William Li , director of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Center in Macau , also testifies to the benefits that the alumni bring for Taiwan : " If they 're not too high up in the government , we generally have no problem contacting them by phone , providing information , and getting together for things like social events . "
But Tan Zhiqiang , himself a returned alumni , points out while it 's fine having dinner together , if it ever came to it , none of the alumni would want to actively " align " themselves with Taiwan , given the pro-Beijing political climate in Macau .
" Which is closer , Taiwan or the mainland ? " asks Tan .
Friendly factions
On the other hand , political divisions are not as sharply defined in Macau as they are in Hong Kong , and people are not so uptight about who they come into contact with .
After all , Macau covers an area of just 23 sq. km -LRB- roughly equivalent to the Nankang district of Taipei -RRB- and has a population of 430,000 .
As Leong Kam Chun says , Macau " still has the feel of a rural society . "
You bump into the same people all the time in Macau , and if you 're too strict about factions , you only make things difficult for yourself .
" Unlike Hong Kong people , Macau people do n't like to talk politics , " says Leong .
" They 're more interested in the economy . "
Leong describes himself as belonging to the pragmatic " making - a - living " faction .
Although pro-Beijing elements prevail in Macau , the former Portuguese administration did n't seem too bothered about PRC pressure when it came to the issue of ties with Taiwan , perhaps because their only concern was for people 's livelihood .
Visa - free entry to Macau for Taiwanese is a case in point .
Explains Wong Hon Keong : " Macau offers visa - free access to residents of over 40 countries with which it has consular relations , but Taiwan is the only place for which it provides visa - free access without there being diplomatic ties . "
Moreover , Taiwanese officials have always had an easier time going in and out of Macau , compared with the fuss involved in getting to Hong Kong .
For example , P.K. Chiang , chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development , visited Macau shortly before the handover , and even figures such as mainland democracy activist Wu'er Kaixi have been admitted to Macau on their way to the mainland - though the mainland authorities of course refused to allow Wu'er to cross into the PRC .
Taiwanese businesspeople in Macau form another group that is usually thought of as only concerned about " making a living . "
Chen Chung - yung , chairman of the Taiwan General Chamber of Commerce is a typical example .
Chen arrived in Macau ten years ago , and ran air - tours by light aircraft until the enclave 's international airport opened , after which he moved into the liquor trade .
When he travels to the mainland he takes his Macau Resident 's Permit , but when he comes back to Taiwan he uses his ROC passport .
As part of his efforts to attract more Taiwanese investors to do business in Macau , he helped introduce President Group CEO Kao Chin - yen to the territory , and in order to build better ties with the mainland Chinese , he helped the Xinhua News Agency in Macau to install satellite TV .
But when he found that his elementary - school - age grandson was speaking Cantonese all day he quickly sent him back to school in Taiwan , fearing that the boy was losing his mother tongue .
A consensus among the Taiwanese living and working in Macau is that " you ca n't use ideology to decide what 's right and wrong . "
Another point they agree on is that not enough was done in the past to develop ties between Taiwan and Macau , but that with Macau 's change of status , and the corresponding change in atmosphere , things should be different from now on .
Chen Chung - yung points out that rents in Macau are about 25 % less than rents in Hong Kong , while Macau 's connections with the European Union means that it enjoys tax concessions and generous trade quotas .
" Taiwanese businesspeople never notice these benefits .
All they see is gang violence and assume that law and order has broken down , " says Chen .
His own account of the situation is that the gangs are fighting it out over casino profits , but that this does n't affect the lives of ordinary people .
Chen encourages people not to worry , and hopes that they wo n't hesitate to invest in Macau .
Economic dwarf , cultural giant
But there are also those who think Chen Chung - yung 's attitude is over-optimistic .
Chen Ming - chih , a Taiwanese businessman based in Dongguan , points out that wages in Macau are not particularly low and there 's very little spare land , no deepwater harbor and no natural resources , which explains why firms remain more interested in investing on the mainland than in Macau .
Wong Hon Keong gives a telling analysis :
" What Macau can offer is a service base , with visa - free access , convenience of travel , and open channels of information .
With Taiwan for R&D and Zhuhai as the manufacturing base , Macau can provide a window to foreign trade , through which companies can increase their exports to the EU . "
Wong 's comments pinpoint the intermediary role that Macau plays between Taiwan and the mainland .
As Leong Kam Chun notes : " Because Macau is so small and sits rights next to mainland China , its economy is always vulnerable to external factors . "
As soon as the Asian financial crisis hit Hong Kong , the Macau economy was similarly affected , and unemployment reached 7 % .
Moreover , the contribution made by Taiwanese businesses to Macau is even less than the spillover from Hong Kong firms investing in neighboring Zhuhai .
Apart from economics , what other forms of possible interaction can Taiwan and Macau share ?
Macau has been a contact point between East and West ever since Portuguese ships first arrived in the 16th century .
As Gary Mei points out , the enclave was opened to the outside world more than 300 years before Hong Kong .
During much of the Ming and Qing dynasties , when maritime trade was officially banned , Macau was the shipping hub for the " Silk Road of the Sea , " which extended as far as South Asia , Africa and Europe in one direction , and Japan , Southeast Asia and South America in the other .
Says Mei : " This is where the Jesuits established the first Western - type university in the Far East , while Chinese scholars such as Hong Xiuquan , Lin Zexu , Liang Qichao , Kang Youwei and Cheng Guanying spent time here absorbing Western learning . "
Macau emerged unscathed from WWII , and many of its original Portuguese - language documents have been preserved intact , providing an invaluable resource for research into cultural and religious exchanges between East and West .
In recent years , these archives have attracted particular attention from Taiwan scholars , notes Mei , driven by interest in the history of East - West exchanges and the influence of maritime culture on their island
Furthermore , Macau also serves as an academic and cultural key to the world of the Romance languages .
As Mei explains , there are plenty of old Portuguese texts preserved in Macau , and the university has a sizeable contingent of Portuguese - speaking professors .
Most of the territory 's 10,000 - plus Macanese -LRB- locally born Portuguese -RRB- have elected to remain after the handover , and there are several cultural groups dedicated to the work of translating Portuguese literature and preserving Portuguese culture .
" Taiwanese who wish to study Portuguese do n't have to go to Europe , " says Mei .
" It 's enough to come to Macau . "
Though it occupies a tiny spit of land , the former Portuguese colony is home to 12 museums of art and history , more than Hong Kong .
" As economic entities go , Macau is tiny , " says Mei , " but as a store of culture it 's huge .
So do n't look down on the place . "
Matsu bridges the gap
Ngan In Leng , president of Macau 's Fujian Association , explains that the traditional three - way ties between Macau , Taiwan and the Southern Fujian region remain to this day , and Taiwanese visitors to Macau can still see traces of Fujianese culture at locations such as Lin Fong Temple and the area around Barrier Gate .
And indeed it was Fujianese fishermen who several centuries ago built the first Matsu temple here - the A - Ma - Gau from which Macau takes its name .
Ung Choi Kun , deputy chairman of Macau 's Fujian General Chamber of Commerce , says that 100,000 mainlanders have moved to Macau in the past two decades , almost all of them from Fujian Province .
At present , around 30,000 people from Macau travel to Taiwan every year for work , many of them ethnic Fujianese taking advantage of family connections to the island .
" When you talk about Matsu and about hometown bonds , it 's not hard finding topics that link Taiwan and Macau , " remarks Ngan In Leng .
" We have many points in common in the field of academia too , such as Sun Yat - sen and the colonial experience , " adds Wu Zhiliang , director of the Macau Foundation .
In the realm of politics , suggests Wong Hon Keong , Macau can also serve as a " catalyst and lubricant for relations across the Taiwan Strait . "
The international airport , where flights between Taiwan and the mainland make a stopover , allows for " one - plane " travel between the two sides .
Also , the continued provision after the handover of visa - free entry for Taiwanese , along with the relative ease with which Taiwan officials can visit the SAR , testifies to Macau 's flexibility in these matters .
" Macau will help to boost cross-strait relations , " says Wong Hon Keong .
But as Tan Zhiqiang points out , nearly a quarter of the residents of Macau have arrived from the mainland during the past ten years .
Unlike the British in Hong Kong , the Portuguese colonial administration always tried to minimize conflict with Beijing , promoting compromise and dialogue .
As a result there was little " anti-China " sentiment among the people of Macau at the time of the handover , in contrast to the pro-democracy mood that swept Hong Kong in 1997 .
" When Taiwanese are confronted with Macau 's ' pro-Beijing ' slant , they should try and be more understanding . " says Tan .
Breaking down fences
In fact , the people of Macau are n't necessarily as ecstatic about the handover as they are made out to be , and after more than 400 years of rule the Portuguese have left behind more than just European - style buildings , Portuguese food , and churches .
Macau University set up a " Handover Workshop " a few years ago , and it has proved highly popular .
Also , a number of books have been brought out by the government and by private publishers , exploring the enclave 's history and identity .
Indeed , " identity " is precisely what the people of Macau have been looking for .
The presence of mainland China is what bonds Taiwan and Macau , yet it is also what keeps them apart .
The spectacular handover ceremony , which took place in the global spotlight , is already over and done with .
Strolling through downtown Macau one notices prominent signs advertising popular Taiwanese snack - stops , like Dingtaifeng Dumpling Restaurant and Quickly Iced Drinks .
Business seems to be thriving at Margaret 's egg - tart bakery , whose brand name is known throughout the region and probably defines " Macau " for many in Taiwan .
For businesspeople , there seems to be little evidence of obstacles in the way of better Taiwan - Macau relations .
The excitement surrounding the handover has died down , and life in Macau goes on much as before .
The artificial boundaries and obstacles that people set up between each other must ultimately be removed by people themselves .
Drifting through a Life of Art
Painter Hsia Yang and his Fuzzy People
-LRB- Tsai Wen - ting / illustrations courtesy of Hsia Yang / tr. by Christopher
The winner of the prize for fine art in last year 's National Culture and Arts Foundation Awards - one of the highest honors for an artist in Taiwan - was contemporary painter Hsia Yang .
Hsia first became a leading light on the Taiwan art scene back in the 1950s , as one of the " Eight Great Outlaws " who launched the island 's modern art movement .
Since then his artistic vocation has taken him around the world , and he has at last ended up back in Taiwan .
What is it that distinguishes Hsia 's work and that marked him out for the National Arts and Culture award , and what kind of contribution has he made to contemporary art in Taiwan ?
Friendly and relaxed by nature , Hsia Yang does n't seem overly excited about winning the National Culture and Arts Award .
If anything it is his friends who are happiest , relieved to see Hsia gaining deserved recognition for the achievements of his peripatetic , ill - starred life .
Lonely start in life
Hsia Tzu - hsiang , as he was then named , was born into a literary family in Hunan Province .
Fate robbed him of his mother within a week of his birth , and of his father when he was just four .
His grandmother took him to Sichuan to escape the war , and they returned a couple of years later to find the family home in ruins .
When he was nine his grandmother died and he was entrusted to a great aunt .
She in turn died when Hsia was 13 , after which he went to live with an uncle and aunt in Hankou .
They wanted to send him to join his elder brother in Changsha , but his brother did n't have the means to take care of him either .
At the age of 16 , after years of being passed from pillar to post , Hsia joined the army - where at least he knew that he 'd get fed .
" It was a big clan , and it just fell apart ! " says Hsia with a rueful smile , the expression of one who has seen life and holds few illusions .
Hsia joined up in the year that the Nationalist forces retreated from the mainland , and soon found himself in a desk job at Air Force General HQ in Taiwan .
By coincidence , the dormitory bunk above his was occupied by another aspiring painter , Wu Hao .
The two became firm friends and began to take classes under Li Chung - sheng , the doyen of modern art in Taiwan .
At Li 's Antung Street Studio they teamed up with a group of like - minded young painters , including Ouyang Wen - yuan , Huo Kang , Hsiao Chin , Li Yuan - chia , Chen Tao - ming and Hsiao Ming - hsien .
Together they formed the Ton - Fan Group , and eventually they became known as the " Eight Great Outlaws " of Taiwanese modern art .
As Hsia recalls , the main incentive for studying under Li Chung - sheng was that Li 's fees were relatively affordable .
Other painters charged upwards of 45 yuan per month , with fees at studios run by older , more established Taiwanese artists reaching 60 or 70 yuan .
No amount of scrimping and saving was going to put that within reach of someone like Hsia , getting by on a military allowance of just 25 yuan per month .
The only choice was the Antung Street Studio , where the monthly fee was just 20 yuan .
Rescuing Chinese art
The economic constraints and repressive censorship of the era did nothing to deter these young art fiends .
As Hsia recalls , the only art materials they could get hold of were red and black ink , courtesy of the military , and pencils .
Sometimes they mixed the ink with glue to produce an oil - paint texture .
Scraping together the money for just one tube of oil paint involved considerable effort , and Hsia remembers repeatedly uncapping that single tube to breathe in the lovely scent of linseed oil .
The painters took turns taking off their shirts to model for each other , and Hsia would sometimes spend the whole day sketching customers at the ice - cream shop by the train station , after paying for a single slice of watermelon .
In 1955 , against the advice of their teacher and clueless about the risks involved in starting up a new organization -LRB- Taiwan was under martial law at the time -RRB- , the young artists formed themselves into the Ton - Fan Group .
People flocked to buy tickets for the exhibition that they mounted at a venue in Taipei 's Chunghua Road , but many visitors found that the art was not to their liking .
Some , feeling " cheated , " flung their exhibition leaflets on the floor in disgust .
" They cost 50 cents each to produce ! " exclaims Hsia , still bemoaning the waste .
Raising the banner of reform , the Outlaws issued a declaration forecasting Chinese art 's inevitable decline if it stayed stuck in the past .
Only through the introduction of modern forms of expression from the outside world , they said , could the boundless resources of China 's art tradition be revitalized .
The declaration , which Hsia drafted , shows that the group 's objective was to modernize Chinese art by drawing Western artistic concepts and methods into the production of essentially Chinese works .
This insistence on the " China " element has been a hallmark of Hsia Yang 's art ever since .
Outlaws around the world
From paintings of his done during that early period , one sees how Hsia rendered human figures using the thick lines of traditional Chinese folk painting , but proceeded to dissect and reassemble those figures in a Western , mechanistic fashion .
In his painting Flying Apsaras , Hsia brings a modern geometrical approach to the traditional image of airborne Buddhist spirits .
Critic Wang Chia - chi describes these divine beings shown wafting through a void of blank space as " kind of surreal . . . like astronauts in a state of weightlessness . "
Hsia has also produced a number of purely abstract works , drawing on his deep familiarity with that most important element of Chinese art - the use of line .
In 1955 Hsiao Chin went to study in Spain , becoming the first of the Ton - Fan Group to go overseas .
He wrote back to Taiwan describing the new trends in art that he was witness to , and the other painters , after poring over the contents of his densely written airmail letters , began putting some of those ideas into practice .
Taiwan was very cut off from the world in those days , and those studying art naturally wanted to see for themselves what was happening elsewhere .
In their letters to Hsiao , all the others , including their teacher Li Chung - sheng , asked about the cost of living overseas .
One by one , each member of the group set off on his own modern art pilgrimage to the West .
Hsia Yang , for whom France was the art center of the world , made his move in 1963 , traveling by ship from Keelung to Hong Kong and from there on to Europe .
The cost of his one - way ticket was borne by his colleague at Air Force HQ Chang Chuan - jen , who generously put his entire savings of NT$ 5,000 at Hsia 's disposal .
On the way to France Hsia stopped off in Milan to visit Hsiao Chin .
Hsia remembers that Hsiao 's first words on meeting were : " Come on , let 's paint . "
For someone like Hsia , orphaned early and shunted for years among various relatives , the support and affection of his friends has played a particularly important part in his life .
Fuzzy people , floating people
During his four - and - a - half years in Paris Hsia lived in a tiny garret in the red light district with barely enough room to stand up in .
He supported himself doing miscellaneous jobs , working on people 's houses and restoring furniture .
Times were tough , but it was during this period that he found what he had been probing for in his use of line , and started on the " fuzzy people " phase of his output .
Hsia 's fuzzy people were born into his work as if by a natural process .
While experimenting with a tangle of lines Hsia found unidentifiable clusters taking shape , from which human forms began to emerge .
" This was something I really knew I could work with , " recalls Hsia .
It was a case of " seizing that special thing of your own , " which for an artist is of the utmost importance .
Like a Taoist priest painting magic symbols , Hsia uses line to create human figures and the written word to invoke power .
With rapid , sweeping strokes of the brush he creates fluid , free - floating figures , without faces or personalities , performing their allotted roles in the midst of a coldly linear realm .
The resulting images reflect the alienation of modern life , conveying a sense of illusion and impermanence .
It has been suggested that Hsia Yang himself , the lifelong drifter , is the prototype for these blurry beings .
But then again , which of us is not in transit , drifting through this brief existence ?
" As the Chinese say , man is a passenger through life who is gone in an instant .
Hsia Yang 's fuzzy people exist very much within this Eastern philosophical context . "
So says Fu Shen , one of the judges in the fine arts category for the 2000 National Culture and Arts Foundation awards .
While he was in France Hsia received a letter from a friend in the US saying : " Life is easier here . "
Soon afterwards he moved to New York , renting a cheap loft in SoHo and supporting himself as a furniture restorer .
Photorealism was the vogue in American painting at the time .
It did n't appeal to Hsia at first , but he knew he had to learn something in his new country of residence , and at the same time he needed to produce work that was commercially viable .
He began employing photographic effects , for example depicting a crowd of passersby on a New York street as a speeding blur .
His work now became populated with " floating people " of this kind , although in spirit they were still the fuzzy people of his earlier period .
Hsia spent over 20 years in New York , painting in the cavernous gloom of his loft , eating Chinese food and listening to traditional Chinese opera music .
The walls of the loft were pasted with simple verses , written by Hsia in language that was part literary Chinese and part colloquial .
" I was like a Chinese person dwelling in a Chinese concession in New York , " says Hsia with a laugh .
The biggest boon of living in New York was that this was where Hsia met his wife Wu Shuang - hsi .
Wu had grown up in a contented home never knowing poverty , and held a PhD in philosophy .
She met Hsia through the painter Hsieh Li - fa , and since then the two of them have shared a simple and quiet life together .
" Feeling anxious when the old lady 's not here , and looking listlessly out the window / So bored of this dumb view , it 's much better when the silly little thing 's around . "
So runs one of Hsia 's light - hearted couplets , testifying to the affection that unites these two people who only came together relatively late in life .
Going home
Hsia returned to Taiwan in 1992 , after three decades away .
With a basic source of income guaranteed through an art - gallery contract , Hsia rented a spacious , light - filled three - story house in Peitou .
The new place was ideal for painting , but at NT$ 35,000 per month the rent was on the high side .
Hsia 's " silly little " wife was in tears when it came to signing the lease , worrying that eventually they would n't be able to afford the rent .
Luckily Professor Li Chih - wen of the National Institute of the Arts offered to support them to the tune of NT$ 10,000 per month for the first three years after their return to Taiwan , and Hsia and his wife were thus able to settle themselves down .
" At key moments , a little help from your friends can make all the difference , " says Hsia .
Financial help from his friends at such moments was what enabled Hsia to go abroad in the first place and then , eventually , to return again to Taiwan .
This is something that the reserved Hsia has frequent cause to think about .
After returning to Taiwan Hsia Yang reverted to painting fuzzy people .
Over the years , Hsia 's fuzzy people have taken on a number of different guises , be it as judges , singers , couples , beach babes or whatever .
They have mimicked famous icons of Western art such as the Mona Lisa , Millet 's The Gleaners , and Botticelli 's Venus , and now the fuzzy family includes well - known figures from the Chinese Buddhist pantheon , part of a series of works that examines the role of religion in people 's lives .
For Hsia Yang , all characters are fair game for inclusion in his work , and all of them end up reverting to nothingness .
Fuzzy people stand up
Why is Hsia so into " fuzzy people , " and has he ever thought about trying something else ?
The painter points out that he ca n't predict what direction he may follow in the future , and says that if a new theme or style emerges it will be through a natural process , like the one that first gave birth to the fuzzy people .
At the end of 2000 Hsia 's fuzzy people at last " stood up " for themselves , becoming sculptures rather than just images on paper .
Hsia was fiddling with an aluminum ring from a broken hair - dryer , shaping it into a little figure , when the idea dawned of doing fuzzy people in solid form .
By cutting and twisting pieces of copper , iron and steel , he was able to produce amusing little statuettes of his hitherto two - dimensional fuzzy people .
Hsia 's friends were not surprised by his move into sculpture , because he has always been good with his hands .
In New York he once made a hand - operated washing machine from a saucepan and several pieces of wood , and on another occasion he used the motor from an electric fan to power a self - adjusting easel .
In Hsia 's hands , all sorts of discarded objects , from sewing machines to camera lenses , are salvaged and put to good use .
" I 'm the Leonardo da Vinci of the Orient , " chuckles Hsia .
Returning East has brought Hsia back into contact with the other " Outlaws " who used to dominate the Taiwan art scene .
Of those , Chen Tao - ming has since given up art and gone into business , Li Yuan - chia passed away in Britain , and Ouyang Wen - yuan does n't paint any more because of psychological problems .
However , Hsiao Chin , Wu Hao , Huo Kang and Hsiao Ming - hsien are all still active .
At a reunion two years ago , Hsia declared proudly : " We 're the same merry band of rebels , still advancing as one ! "
For artists to produce outstanding work they have to immerse themselves utterly in the act of creation .
These painters , remaining committed to the " pure " creative spirit and thoroughly loyal to the cause of art , are still the same old " outlaws " that they ever were .

The Genuine Article --
Our French Nanny
-LRB- Chou Chin - cheng / tr. Scott Williams -RRB-
When my wife 's company sent her to Paris to work , we did n't think that our daughter , then just over a year old , would have any problems with attending school there .
Little did we imagine a colleague would inform us that her daughter had been " surrounded and attacked " by a group of young French children on her first day of pre-school .
The incident frightened her so badly that she would n't let her daughter go back to school .
If that was the case , my wife and I had a serious problem on our hands .
What could we do with Chien - chien if she was going to be viewed as a " little foreigner " and be bullied at school every day ?
The only solution seemed to be to have her learn French .
That way , if we ended up in court , at least she would n't have to stand there mute .
And so we hired Martine , a Frenchwoman in her 50s , to be Chien - chien 's nanny .
My wife truly treasures Chien - chien , and was not at all comfortable with the idea of leaving her with someone else .
First , we had no idea what kind of person Martine was .
We knew only that she was a licensed nanny with documents from the French government , and hiring her to look after Chien - chien seemed better than hiring a cheaper unlicensed nanny .
Second , Chien - chien understood no French , so we were concerned that she might be mistreated .
We could n't have guessed that Martine would treasure her just as much as my wife does .
And Martine knew how to handle children !
My wife and I thank Heaven for her .
I remember the first day we took Chien - chien to Martine 's place .
My wife and Chien - chien played out an extended farewell scene before finally tearfully parting .
And her father ?
Although I understood no French in those days , I was prepared to spend the whole day with Chien - chien .
I wanted to convey to Martine the idea that " if you beat the dog , you 'd better be prepared to deal with the master . "
But in spite of my resolution , within ten minutes , with Martine gesturing and Chien - chien sobbing , I was hustled out the door .
At first , I thought I had better stand outside and " keep an eye on things , " but then I realized that that would n't accomplish anything , and I made my dejected way home .
Later Martine told my wife that I had had to leave unless I wanted to spend my entire life holding Chien - chien 's hand .
It took Martine to remind us that short , sharp pains are better than long , drawn - out suffering .
At the outset , we were concerned that Chien - chien would n't like French food , so we prepared a lunchbox for her everyday and delivered it with her to Martine .
But every evening , her lunchbox came back untouched .
Was n't she eating ?
Thinking , " If this continues , she 'll starve to death , " we confronted Martine .
Confronted , Martine calmly informed us that Chien - chien could n't spend her entire time in France eating the lunchboxes we prepared .
And , she continued , since that was the case , why not get Chien - chien used to eating French food as soon as possible ?
Furthermore , she informed us that her own nutritious homemade meals would help Chien - chien grow .
She was even planning to prepare a " dinner box " for Chien - chien to bring home in the evenings .
Our " confrontation " turned into an abject apology !
One day , Martine mentioned to us that Chien - chien was a little cross-eyed .
However , she said we were not to worry because children 's eyes usually correct themselves as they get older .
To ease our minds , she had already taken Chien - chien to see her uncle , an ophthalmologist .
If Chien - chien would visit him again four or five times at two - week intervals , everything would be fine .
When we asked her about the fee , she would only say that it should n't be much .
In fact , she never did tell us .
Usually , nannies view sick children as an annoyance because they require more care , and often must be given medication .
As a result , most nannies expect that a child 's family will take care of it when it is sick .
But Martine was different .
When the weather turned cool and Chien - chien came down with a fever , Martine called my wife to offer to keep Chien - chien for the night .
She told my wife that she had been a nurse and that taking Chien - chien home in the cold night air might worsen her chill .
My wife , who had been hoping to take care of our sick daughter herself when she got home from work , naturally declined her kind offer .
In this way , we became more and more comfortable -LRB- and more and more grateful -RRB- having Martine as Chien - chien 's nanny .
I think Martine treated Chien - chien just as if she were her own child .
Our daughter is now three years old and attends a pre-school near our home .
Chien - chien 's teacher has told my wife that Chien - chien 's French is very good .
Perhaps because our little " foreigner " now speaks French , she gets along very well with her classmates ; they all remember her French name , Elodie , and let her know that I 'm there when they see me coming to pick her up after school .
We owe all of this to Martine .
We were lucky to find someone so skilled in the art of being a nanny .
She helped us so much .
Thank you , Martine !

A Gao Xingjian Storm Blows through the TIBE
-LRB- Laura Li / tr. Scott Williams -RRB-
The ninth Taipei International Book Exhibition - the " first book exhibition of the millennium " - got underway this year in the comfortable afterglow of the Lunar New Year 's holiday .
Highlighting this year 's show was a visit by Nobel - Prize - winning author Gao Xingjian from his adopted country , France .
According to Gao , Taiwan feels almost like home .
Moreover , his affinity for Taiwan and its affection for him left a good impression at this year 's TIBE .
Gao 's old friend Lung Ying - tai , director of the Taipei Bureau of Cultural Affairs , nonetheless thanked him for his visit and for re-igniting Taiwan 's passion for literature .
Gao Xingjian , the first Chinese Nobel Laureate for literature , created quite a stir with his visit to the ninth Taipei International Book Exhibition -LRB- TIBE -RRB- , drawing large crowds of people hoping just to catch a glimpse of him .
Gao 's relationship with Taiwan goes back a number of years , and this visit to the TIBE marked his sixth to the island , where he is well known and has many friends in the literary community .
A Bible in hand
Taiwan 's United Daily News Publishing spotted Gao 's talent long before he became famous , publishing five of his novels - including Soul Mountain and One Man 's Bible .
In addition , the famed director Li Hsing 's Tienti Publishing has published a collection of Gao 's plays .
And at this year 's TIBE , Gao released three new works to hungry Taiwanese readers : a collection of 100 ink paintings and pieces of art criticism ; a play ; and a collection entitled Without isms .
In the past , Gao 's works of fiction have not sold particularly well , perhaps because some find them to be cold or to resemble to long , mumbling soliloquies .
At this year 's TIBE , however , the glow of Gao 's Nobel Prize sparked interest in his work .
Over the exhibition 's six days , readers purchased between five and six thousand volumes of his Soul Mountain , making it one of the exhibition 's top three sellers -LRB- along with former Japanese porn star Iijima Ai 's Platonic Sex and the latest Harry Potter book -RRB- .
Whether Taiwanese readers were just putting on airs or actually enjoyed the book , if the Gao frenzy reinvigorates Taiwanese interest in pure literature , it will have done a world of good .
Gao 's own artistic life extends beyond fiction to painting and theater .
Over the past few years he has held two Taiwanese exhibitions of his modern ink paintings , and a third is planned for October at the National Museum of History .
In addition , a special reading of Gao 's The Night Walker was given at the Novel Hall in Taipei , during this visit of his .
And Gao himself will direct a performance of his August Snow at the end of the year .
The refined language of literature
Having a chance to see Gao in person , TIBE visitors naturally focused on his artistic vision and creative process .
In a speech presented at the exhibition , Gao stated that over the course of decades of writing , he has given ever - greater attention to the heart of literature - the art of language .
To Gao , the only standard for judging literature is the beauty of its language , and language itself is a means of getting at " reality . "
Gao refers to his own approach to writing as " stream - of - language " and believes that writers who seek a vivid , modern Chinese face an extremely difficult path .
Gao also revealed that to ensure that his own writing remains fresh and lively , he first speaks his thoughts into a recorder before later recasting them in a written form .
Gao Xingjian feels that writing is an extremely personal pursuit , that its starting point is a quest for personal values .
If a writer is to produce good work , he must cast aside political and social missions , disregard the opinions of readers and the market , and instead must write spontaneously , listening carefully to the faintest , most honest voice in his heart .
Considering that Gao fled a tyrannical government to become an expatriate , many people wonder whether Gao 's literature insists upon humanitarianism and high principles .
But Gao feels that literature is above politics and should not serve it .
Further , literature should not be limited by morals , ethics or public sentiment .
In Gao 's view , 20th century literature too often emphasized " literary revolution " or was " revolutionary literature . "
It was too often tied to a preposterous sense of mission which took literature with it to the grave .
As Gao said at the Nobel Prize awards ceremony , Communist rule stymied the development of mainland Chinese literature .
Not surprisingly , the Chinese Communists were critical of the selection of Gao as a Nobel Laureate , labeling his choice an " imperialist conspiracy " and another " insult to all Chinese " by the West .
This standoff between the Nobel laureate and his cultural motherland adds a note of regret to the joy of Chinese people around the world .
Soul Mountain and the flesh
Given that Gao wrote his works in Chinese , his translator played a major role in his winning of the Nobel prize .
Goran Malmqvist , a member of the Swedish Royal Academy and Gao 's strongest advocate for the Nobel Prize , and Noel and Liliane Dutrait , the French translators of Soul Mountain and other works by Gao , also attended this year 's TIBE .
To reflect the growing internationalization of Chinese literature , this year 's TIBE even included a Taiwanese Literature in Translation pavilion .
The pavilion hosted a number of seminars and colloquia on literary translation , providing readers with some insight into a field with which most are unfamiliar .
Gao has touched off another interesting debate in Taiwan - one on the competing desires of the spirit and the flesh .
Discussing Gao together with former Japanese porn star Iijima Ai causes many cultural critics to shake their heads , but the two writers ' works are not that dissimilar .
While Soul Mountain describes one man 's spiritual journey , it also contains numerous graphic descriptions of sexual desire .
Similarly , Ai 's book on the flesh actually expresses her longing for spiritual love .
These two works remind us that the spirit and the flesh are both aspects of being human and that the distance between these two " opposing desires " is not as great as most people seem to think .
While Gao Xingjian is the first Nobel Laureate in literature to have attended the TIBE , this year 's exhibition included a number of other highlights .
With 46 nations and 886 publishing companies represented , TIBE is the largest book show in Asia and the fourth largest in the world .
This year 's TIBE was also made special by having France as its Country of Honor .
Guests thus included Andrei Makine , the Russian - born French author of Le Testament Francais and winner of France 's prestigious Goncourt Prize ; novelist Marc Levy ; and the cartoonist Golo .
In addition , numerous representatives from France Edition and Librairie Le Pigeonnier were involved with the exhibition from start to finish , contributing greatly to its success .
The Book Publishing Development Association of the ROC , which sponsored the TIBE this year , noted that it chose France as the Country of Honor in response to the Americanization of global culture .
The Association stated that it hoped the choice of France would give Taiwan 's readers a glimpse of European culture , offering them exposure to an alternative perspective and system of thought .
Of course , the fact that Gao is now a French citizen and happened to win the Nobel Prize for literature just two months before the show did n't hurt either .

Activities Mark International Human Rights Day
-LRB- Sharon Wu / tr. by Phil Newell -RRB-
Protecting human rights is one of the key policies of the new government .
Among the activities conducted in this vein , on December 10 , 2000 - International Human Rights Day - the Office of the President and the National Cultural Association co-sponsored a unique " human rights wedding ceremony . "
In addition , President Chen Shui - bian initiated a series of activities under the theme of Human Rights Week to remind Taiwan citizens of the importance of human rights .
In commemoration of International Human Rights Day on December 10 , the Nationsl Human Rights Consultative Task Force of the Office of the President organized a series of activities to draw attention to this issue .
First up was a conference at National Taiwan University on the subject of reviewing the cases of persons persecuted as " communist spies . "
A lively discussion of the cases of Sun Li - jen and Kuo Ting - liang took place .
On December 9 , a ceremony was held on Green Island , site of a former political prison , to commemorate the first anniversary of the construction of the Human Rights Memorial there .
On December 10 came the " human rights wedding ceremony " at the Taipei Guest House , and that same night an event to express " thanksgiving and respect " was held at the Taipei International Convention Center .
The Green Island Human Rights Memorial , completed a year ago , takes as its focus the determination that the terrible events of the past should never be repeated .
It reminds the people of Taiwan of the long period of " white terror " under which the island suffered , and hopes to raise humanitarian awareness .
Pesus Chou , executive secretary of the Human Rights Education Foundation , says that this year a further list of 180 victims was accepted , and there are now a total of 690 names of victims of political persecution engraved on the wall .
A number of victims and their family members also attended the ceremony , at which they presented a petition on behalf of more than 10,000 victims of political terror whose names can not be inscribed on the wall because of lack of official documentation of their cases .
They called for justice for these victims as well .
President Chen Shui - bian personally attended the anniversary event , and vowed to carry on the policy , initiated by the previous government , of apologizing to and caring for the victims .
He emphasized that his administration would abide by the International Declaration of Human Rights , the Citizens ' Public Trust Treaty , and the manifesto and action platform of the Vienna International Convention on Human Rights , so that Taiwan could be a part of the international human rights system .
He again called on the Legislative Yuan to codify international human rights law as domestic law , and declared that his government will also establish a National Human Rights Commission and work to build a society in which human rights are respected and protected .
On the morning of Human Rights Day , the National Culture Association and the well - known author Bo Yang -LRB- one of the prime movers behind the Human Rights Memorial -RRB- held a " human rights marriage ceremony . "
The event , conducted in beautiful weather at the Taipei Guest House , was attended by a number of couples from around Taiwan who chose this day to formalize their ties .
President Chen served as master of ceremonies .
During the ceremony , President Chen read out the eight vows drafted by Bo Yang for his " Human Rights Marriage Certificate , " extolling mutual respect for domestic human rights as the foundation of social stability .
Besides having President Chen serve as master of ceremonies , Bo Yang and Vice President Annette Lu served as honored guests , while Control Yuan President Frederick Chien and Minister of the Interior Chang Po - ya also had prominent roles .
Among those in attendance were Senior Advisor to the President Yu Chen Yue - ying , Minister of Education Ovid Tzeng , and Council for Aboriginal Affairs Chairman Yohani Iskakavut .
Representatives of various sectors of society , including dentists , lawyers , military personnel , civil servants , indigenous people , and the handicapped , were among the couples taking part in the ceremony , which was meant to be inclusive of and meaningful for all citizens .
With more than 100 guests and family members also joining in , there was fun to be had by one and all .
President Chen toasted the new couples and expressed his hope that they would soon give birth to " human rights babies " and act as pioneers in building a human rights society , creating models for the passing along of human rights education in the family .

In the first " human rights wedding ceremony , " 36 couples took vows to respect each other 's human rights , creating the first " human rights families . "
" At the End of Rainbows " Looking for Palauan Pots of Gold
" From Taiwan 's point of view , Palau is like a freshly opened oyster , when you first see the shining pearl . "
So declares Gennie Yen , the director of the ROC Office of the Palau Visitors Authority .
To be sure , since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the ROC and Palau last December 29 , the island has received considerable media attention in Taiwan .
The number of Taiwan visitors to Palau in January was double the number of last January .
In March , foreign minister Chen Chien - jen led a delegation to Palau which included government officials , private sector business people , and representatives of the mass media .
And in April , the Taipei office of the Palau Visitors Authority formally opened its doors .
This " Palau fever " has also infected Taiwan business people , who are always " susceptible " to new opportunities .
Building on the foundation of formal diplomatic relations , many Taiwanese firms are anxious to try their hand and to explore Palau 's investment environment .
A guidebook describes this beautiful archipelago nation in the South Pacific as being " at the end of rainbows . "
Though this may seem far , far away , in fact , Palau is geographically the closest to Taiwan of all the countries with which the ROC has formal diplomatic ties .
A direct flight takes only three - and - a - half hours .
Perhaps for Taiwanese , there are rather more immediate implications to " the end of rainbows . "
This unfamiliar and exotic land is a virgin territory of commercial opportunities for tourism , trade and investment .
Jewels in the Pacific
Taiwan and Palau share much more in common in terms of culture and historical position than most people realize .
The people of Palau are of the same ethnic background as the aboriginal people of Taiwan - Malayo - Polynesian .
Last year when the inaugural Polynesian Cultural Festival was held in Taitung County , scholars and arts troupes from Palau were among the participants .
During the modern age of Western and Japanese colonialism , both Taiwan and Palau experienced foreign rule which has left traces of Spanish , Japanese , American , and other cultures .
After WWII , Taiwan was returned to Chinese rule , while Palau became a UN trust territory under US authority .
-LRB- Palau did not gain full independence until 1994 . -RRB-
Palau - Taiwan political contacts began in the 1980s .
In 1983 , President Haruo I. Remeliik led the first Palauan delegation to Taiwan .
There have been numerous official visits since then .
In 1984 , the two countries signed an agricultural cooperation agreement , and Taiwan dispatched a technical assistance team there .
Since the beginning of exchanges between the two governments , Taiwanese business people have been conducting trade with Palau , and have also invested there , entering the restaurant , fishing , retail , and other trades .
During the Taiwan Strait missile crises in 1995 and 1996 , when rumors and panic filled the air , fraudulent business groups in Taiwan cheated many investors with a scam surrounding real estate in Palau , but there was a silver lining to this cloud : It attracted the attention of more Taiwan business people , and especially the domestic tourism industry , to business opportunities in Palau .
Bin - fang Stone , now director of the Palau - ROC Friendship Association , was one of those who came to Palau at that time to explore the possibility of investment in real estate .
Stone states : " Before independence , there was a serious lack of tourist facilities in Palau .
Most of the visitors were in specially - organized groups from the US or Japan which came for deep sea fishing or scuba diving .
It was only when Taiwan tourist agencies began developing the tourist route to Palau that many Taiwanese began to invest in the tourism industry here . "
Snorkeling , one of the most popular activities in Palau , was brought in by Taiwanese entrepreneurs , and you could say that they have been among the founders of the Palauan tourism industry .
Currently there are more than 100 Taiwanese living in Palau .
Most of them are in the tourism industry , in operations such as tourist agencies , hotels , and water sports .
Though most of the investments are small , there are large projects , including the Hotel Palau , opened in 1998 and built by the Kuomintang - run ACC Corporation development company , as well as a large vacation spa currently being built by the Hung Kuo Group .
In addition , Taiwan businessman Chen Liang - shen made a major investment by purchasing outright a local hotel .
Zero pollution
Many Taiwan business people saw the establishment of formal diplomatic relations as a green light for investment in Palau .
The foreign ministry delegation that visited Palau in March included private sector firms involved in tourism , textiles , electronics , and fishing , who went to investigate the investment environment .
Taiwanese entrepreneurs already in Palau enthusiastically welcomed the establishment of an embassy there , which makes the future of their investments even more secure .
Lin Neng - jong , director - general of the Industrial Development and Investment Center of the Ministry of Economic Affairs , who visited the island in March , points to some special concerns in the Palau investment environment : For one thing , the main islands are too rocky for agricultural development .
Moreover , the economy is not highly developed , and - except for fishing products - other materials all have to be imported .
Therefore the island is not at an advantage in material terms .
In addition , the total population is only 18,000 .
Anyone interested in establishing a factory there will face a labor shortage .
In fact , Palau relies on " imports " for most of its labor as well , and there are 6000 foreign workers in the country .
Lin concludes : " Tourism is still the best investment in Palau right now . "
Early Taiwanese investors have certainly been proved perspicacious , since Palau 's pollution - free environment is its greatest asset .
Diving aficionados have hailed Palau as the greatest of the seven wonders of the deep .
Its waters support more than 700 varieties of coral and 1500 varieties of fish .
The ocean water is warm and the currents are moderate , making for ideal diving conditions .
In addition , there is a great deal of shallow water , which is tailor - made for snorkeling , so that even tourists who are not particularly at home in the water can enjoy the magnificence of the ocean .
Especially noteworthy is " Blue Corner , " one of the most famous snorkeling locations in the world .
And it is not only the ocean that is beautiful ; Palau 's land scenery is also absorbing .
The " Rock Islands , " known as " a garden on the sea , " have extensive white sand beaches and a rich variety of coastal plant life , as well as amazing waterfalls .
The islands of Peleliu and Anguar , which were battlefields in the Pacific war between the US and Japan , are criss - crossed by tunnels built by the Japanese , while the remains of ships and aircraft dot the ocean floor .
These islands have great potential as sites for historical tourism .
In the air , because Palau is a tropical ocean climate , and rains leave as fast as they come , tourists are often treated to rainbows .
Gennie Yen , the director of the Taiwan office of the Palau Visitors Authority , says that people have even seen three rainbows at one time .
And if there has been no rain , you can see a kind of horizontal rainbow by standing on the beach at sunset and following with your eyes the different shades of blue of the receding ocean as they merge into the bands of reds in the evening sky .
In these islands surrounded by coral , which are virtually always calm and windless , you can be pulled into the sky under a parasailer , and have a whiff of what the scent of Heaven must be like .
In addition , the bia -LRB- traditional structures where men met to socialize and discuss local affairs -RRB- , and also the local species of non-poisonous jellyfish , are other items that are especially interesting to tourists .
Reinvigorating the tourism market
Lin Neng - jong says there are two viable directions to get into the Palau tourism industry .
One is to invest in a tourism - related industry in Palau , the other is to increase the number of Taiwan tourists and extend profit opportunities into Taiwan itself .
Oddly , despite Palau 's beauty , in the past few years tourism has dropped off considerably .
In 1997 , there were more than 70,000 foreign visits to Palau .
Last year the figure was 50,000 .
Taiwan has been , along with Japan , one of the main sources of tourists to Palau .
In 1997 , the number of Taiwanese visitors peaked at more than 30,000 annually , but now is down to well below 20,000 .
As a result , Taiwan tourism businesses in Palau , which mainly cater to Taiwanese , are crying uncle .
" It 's not only the hotel industry , even at Chinese restaurants business has fallen off sharply , " says Chu Hui - chun .
Chu , who also operates a tourist agency , was forced to move the Chinese restaurant she had run for many years to much smaller premises .
Hsu Wen - sheng , deputy director - general of the ROC Tourism Bureau , says that a major reason why profit margins have shrunk is that tour operators in Taiwan no longer aggressively push Palau as a destination .
Hsu notes that Far East Airlines , which operates the Taiwan - to - Palau route , raised the price of a ticket by over NT$ 3000 two years ago , citing inadequate passenger demand and high costs .
This made Palau much less competitive compared to other places such as Guam , Bali , and Phuket .
Hsu concludes : " If the price is raised for tour groups , no one is interested , but if the original price is maintained , the tour operators ' profit falls too low .
A lot of tourist agencies have simply given up promoting this route . "
James Yeh , general manager of the Sunrise Express Travel Service , which specializes in Pacific Island tours , says that the current trend among travelers in Taiwan is for low group fares with lots of entertainment provided .
Most people who go on island vacations are looking for pure recreation , so they would prefer to be somewhere where the facilities are more developed .
Though Palau is rich in natural attractions , it lacks peripheral tourist facilities like pubs , shopping centers , and gift shops , so naturally the islands are less attractive .
Despite all this , James Yeh notes that the rate of return visitors to Palau is very high , more than 30 % .
Clearly the island is still very appealing .
If the problems of high group rates and inadequate facilities can be solved , there is enormous potential yet in Palau .
The Palauan government is working hard to eliminate obstacles to solving the above problems .
Johnny Itaru Kishigawa , director of the Palau Visitors Authority , says that the government is going forward on a new airport and a number of tourist - related facilities .
They are also studying a proposal from the Taiwan side to lower landing fees and reduce underlying ticket costs .
In addition , the PVA now has a Taiwan office , and hopes to raise Palau 's profile among Taiwan travellers .
Gone fishin'
In the current wave of interest in investment in Palau , the fisheries industry is also getting attention .
Currently , there 's only one Taiwanese business person in the fishing industry in Palau - Tai Jung - fei - so profits are quite good .
" At first I was in business with a bunch of friends , and we rented eight fishing boats , but profits were only ordinary .
After my friends pulled out of the operation , I switched over to mainly running a base for fishing boats . "
Little did he expect that profits would be much larger , especially after the company acquired local fishing rights for 75 years .
During the peak season from May to October , more than ten tuna ships come in every day to offload their catch and to resupply .
These days , Tai 's Palau Marine Industries covers an area of 1.5 acres and employs more than 40 staff .
It offers advanced freezing facilities and two aircraft , guaranteeing to deliver tuna fresh to the Japanese market within 24 hours .
However , though Tai has made quite a name for himself with his business , this does not necessarily mean that other Taiwanese can come and make similar investments .
Koo Kuang - ming , chairman of Koo 's Holdings Company Ltd. , which operates fishing boats in the South Pacific , explains that South Pacific fishing is divided into two types - net fishing , and line fishing of tuna .
Palau is not really suited to the former , because its territorial waters are not large , so the catch is limited .
On the other hand , tuna stocks there are high , so Palau is more suited to line fishing .
But the problem is that Tai Jung - fei is already running a tuna base there , and it is debatable whether there is the need for another one .
Koo warns : " It 's hard to estimate the potential catch .
If there were several firms , the risk would be much greater . "
In addition , though there are many varieties of fish around Palau , the scale of operations is small , and markets are far away , so the return on investment would not necessarily be very high .
Koo points instead to a different option : The waters around Palau are clear and warm , which makes them suited to aquaculture .
So far , returns from the small - scale aquaculture of scallops have been decent .
Koo cautions , however , that " if you want to invest , you have to go large - scale , because after all Palau is far from the main markets . "
Palau Free Trade Zone
In 1986 , Palau , like many former American - controlled trust territories , signed a " Compact of Free Association " with the US .
The agreement allows Palauan products to enter the States tax - free , and there are no quota limits for such things as textiles .
For Taiwan , a major producer of textiles and electronics , this is a very strong investment incentive .
Currently Japanese and Taiwanese business people are negotiating with the Palauan government to establish a Palau Free Trade Zone .
The idea is for Palau to designate a special zone for economic development , with the Palau government providing tax and land - use incentives .
The zone would be for processing of exports , mainly in textiles and electronics , and mainly to the US market .
Felix Yen , president of the Zhen An Palau Corporation , which is handling the Hung Kuo project , is very familiar with the business climate in Palau .
He says that right now the main obstacles to foreign investment are land acquisition and communications .
Under Palauan law foreigners are not allowed to own land there , but can only lease land for development .
The longest permitted lease is 50 years .
But even leasing is a complicated matter , because traditionally land in Palau is owned jointly by the family and the clan .
Moreover , communications and Internet access are not very reliable .
All of these problems deter investors .
Though the communications problems may be resolved within a few years - the government has received US assistance for priority construction of electricity and fiber optic facilities - Lin Neng - jong still cautions those interested in signing on to the free trade zone plan to " be prudent . "
" The point to watch out for in the whole plan is that Taiwan firms may not understand that it might not be all that good a deal from the point of view of the Palau authorities , " he says .
Currently foreign firms are more pro-active than the Palauan government , which has its own concerns : The indigenous population is small , and there could be social problems if a large number of foreign workers come to the islands .
Also , the government must weigh economic development against environmental destruction .
" The terms under which Palau would accept the proposed zone may not be as good as many Taiwan business people optimistically expect . "
Looking at the larger picture , however , there are many areas and ways to invest .
A careful look will show that Palau has many pearls .
Li Mao - tsung , a pottery expert living in the US , who was commissioned by the ROC government to do a study of the suitability of Palauan clays for pottery , says that Palau has a lot of clay of decent quality , making the islands a good location for the development of art pottery or large scale pottery and porcelain production .
Unique investment opportunities like these are waiting to be taken up by alert entrepreneurs .
Perhaps Palau is , as Gennie Yen says , like a just - opened oyster , with the pearl gleaming before your eyes .
But to grasp the pearl , Taiwan business people will have to rely on their wisdom and experience .
Full Press Court : Media Exchanges Boost Foreign Ties
-LRB- / tr. by Phil Newell -RRB-
The fourth Television News Seminar for Friendly Nations , sponsored by the Government Information Office , began just after the lunar new year .
This event , like the three preceding it , brings media professionals from countries with formal diplomatic ties with the ROC to Taiwan to receive training .
Each year the course is offered in a different language to accomodate different participating countries : In 1987 it was in Spanish , in 1998 English , and in 1999 French .
The results so far have been good .
Where do these media professionals come from ?
What do they take home with them ?
Is this helpful in consolidating ROC diplomatic relations ?
The fourth Television News Seminar for Friendly Nations began on February 21 , and will last for 19 days .
Activities include lectures on communications and broadcast theory , visits to domestic media , and activities to help the visitors understand the people and culture of Taiwan .
Through these activities , the GIO hopes to give these citizens from the ROC 's diplomatic - partner states both knowledge and warm hospitality .
Most of those attending this year 's course come from anglophone countries in the Caribbean Basin .
These include Grenada , St. Vincent and the Grenadines , Dominica , and St. Kitts and Nevis -LRB- all eastern Caribbean islands -RRB- and Belize -LRB- on the Central American isthmus -RRB- .
This year 11 high - level media professionals , media owners , and front - line journalists are in attendance .
According to the GIO , the study session is the result of agreements to boost journalistic exchange , and is an innovative and concrete way to implement these agreements .
Most of those attending hold high positions in their domestic media .
During their stay in Taiwan , they are not only introduced to media elites in Taiwan and to the local media environment and facilities , but can also gain a greater knowledge of the land and people of the Republic of China .
This they can take home to share with their fellow citizens , thereby helping the ROC 's diplomatic partners and their peoples to understand Taiwan better .
The sessions have been run by the Broadcasting Development Fund .
Lecturers are mainly broadcasting and journalism experts from Taiwan .
This year they include Michael Kuan , Andrew Hsia , and Jason Blatt .
The course includes classes on political broadcasting , international broadcasting information / propaganda strategies , and digital television broadcast development , as well as visits to the Central Broadcasting Corporation , Taiwan Television Corporation , Eastern TV , and other media outlets .
Generally speaking , the participants are very interested in Taiwan 's high - tech industries and products .
Visits to the Kuanghua computer market have proven especially popular .
The visitors are generally favorably impressed by the prosperity of Taipei City and by the consumer behavior of Taiwanese .
In a television interview , television news producer Marcus Bailey from Maitland TV of Grenada said that he has learned a great deal about the editing facilities and techniques used in Taiwan television , and that he would be able to apply this information in his own television production work when he returned home .
This experience , he said , has deepened his desire to get further involved in television production work .
He added that he would very much enjoy an opportunity to work together with colleagues from Taiwan television .
Section chief Victor Chu of the GIO , who has been involved in organizing the camp three times , says that all the participants are very satisfied with the course .
After returning home most of them produce newspaper accounts of their experience .
Unfortunately , it is very difficult for them to apply the technical infomation they learned , because in most cases they lack the hardware and facilities available in Taiwan .
Thus they are only able to apply the theoretical insights they picked up to their own media work at home .
Chu says that the concrete results of the course will only become visible with a longer time frame .
This is just like overall relations between two countries : They can only be consolidated by a long period of continual exchange .

Did aliens also come to have a look at the Taipei Lantern Festival ?
Do n't be silly , this is the Taipei Lantern Festival 's main theme lantern : " The Millenium Gold Dragon . "
Standing 17 meters tall and 18 meters wide , it 's a gold dragon embracing a globe , and it is supposed to convey the idea of a dragon bringing good luck to the world .

A Chinese Director Makes Her Mark in Australia
-LRB- Teng Sue - feng / tr. by Jonathan Barnard -RRB-
Some people are calling the 21st cent - ury the century of the dragon , and for ethnic Chinese filmmakers there appears to be some truth to the designation .
First Ang Lee 's Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon won Golden Globes for best director and best foreign - language film as well as 10 Oscar nominations , and then Lin Cheng - sheng won the Silver Bear at the Berlin Film Festival for Betelnut Beauty .
Clara Law , who has earned renown in Australia for Floating Life and The Goddess of 1967 , is yet another ethnic Chinese filmmaker winning awards at international festivals .
Law has produced a remarkably varied body of work , which ranges from the realistic to the mythic and includes such films as Farewell China and Temptation of a Monk .
She is especially gifted at describing the experiences of Chinese emigrants .
How did Law , one of the last working woman directors from Hong Kong and Taiwan , attain Australian government film grants after emigrating there ?
Weighing only about 40 kilos , Law looks light enough to blow away in a strong wind , so it 's hard to imagine her barking out orders on a film set .
But when Law and her husband Eddie Fong were invited to attend the Taipei Film Festival last year , Fong , who is also a screenwriter and director , revealed , " Clara is very strong willed , and everyone in the Australian film community knows that she ca n't be pushed around and rarely compromises . "
In The Goddess of 1967 there is a scene where the girl who is the film 's leading character -LRB- played by Rose Byrne -RRB- and her mother encounter heavy winds in their car .
The film crew had set up the lights to shoot this scene of a dust storm , when suddenly Byrne said she was hungry and wanted to rest .
" Clara knew that she was n't really hungry , but rather that she just found it difficult to concentrate sometimes since it was the first time she had been in a film , so she told Rose that she could n't eat .
The assistant director , who was Australian , looked aghast , as if Clara was a witch who was abusing a poor child . "
The Goddess of 1967 refers to a '67 Chevy named " Goddess . "
In it a Japanese man goes to Australia to find the car of his dreams and happens to meet a blind girl named B.G. -LRB- Byrne -RRB- .
The two take to the road , hoping to find some direction to their lives .
For her performance , Byrne won the best actress award at last year 's Venice Film Festival .
This was the second film Law and Fong had made with Australian government money since they immigrated there in 1994 .
-LRB- Floating Life was the first . -RRB-
Finding direction
Law explains that their decision to move to Australia was a well - laid plan , not a spur - of - the - moment thing .
In 1993 - 1994 , after shooting Fruit Punch and Temptation of a Monk in Hong Kong , the couple went to Australia to visit relatives and rest .
It was then that they discovered that the technical level of the Australian film industry was very high .
" The biggest problem with making films in Hong Kong is the lack of money budgeted for post-production , " Law notes .
" Dolby sound costs a lot of money . "
They were extremely disappointed with the sound on Autumn Moon , so they decided to go to Australia to redo it .
When the film was subsequently presented at the Sydney film festival , it was well received , and this brought them into contact with Australian producers .
" Originally , we thought that we were just changing workplaces and would spend half the year in Australia writing and then half the year in Hong Kong shooting , " Law says .
" We did n't expect that it would be our destiny to put down roots in Australia . "
Faced with Hollywood 's cultural onslaught , governments around the world are offering grants to protect their own film industries .
Last year the Australian government budgeted more than A$ 40 million -LRB- the equivalent of NT$ 700 million -RRB- for this purpose .
As long as a film has an outstanding plan and the backing of a production company and a distributor , it has a chance at getting a grant .
The amount of the grants vary , depending on the topic of a film .
For The Goddess of 1967 , the Australian government provided nearly NT$ 50 million , or 70 % of the total budget , Fong explains .
Furthermore , they allowed the director to exercise creative control .
The only problem was that they imposed strict deadlines and a quota of jobs that had to be filled by Australians , and they stipulated that Australian actors must be given first priority .
So as to seek creative inspiration and find new material in a foreign land , the two bought a four - wheel - drive SUV and explored all over Australia .
The desert both frightened and intrigued Law : " I gradually began to feel that this ancient landscape was well suited to showing the loneliness of modern people , " she recalls .
" It was a good match for my films . "
Culture clash
Law , who has now finished nine films , was born in Macao in 1957 .
In 1978 she graduated from the University of Hong Kong with a degree in English literature and found work in television .
She directed 12 different TV movies before going to London to get her masters in 1982 , where she majored in screenplay writing and directing .
Her thesis project , They Say the Moon Is Fuller , won a silver medal at the Chicago Film Festival .
Her first film after graduating was the 1988 work The Other Half and the Other Half , which explored the uncomfortable problem of spouses being separated by national boundaries , a familiar situation in Hong Kong , which is a cradle of emigration .
It was the first Hong Kong film to deal with this theme .
" I grew up amid two cultures , " Law recalls .
" When I was little , my grandfather taught me to read Chinese poems and do calligraphy .
Then , when I entered English school , I learned how to think in English .
It was n't until I went abroad for three years that I discovered I was in fact neither Chinese nor English . "
Law says that from a young age all Hong Kongers learned that they were living in a borrowed place on borrowed time .
Her childhood friends would all go abroad to study .
Yet Hong Kong movies were n't acknowledging this problem .
Since movies were regarded merely as entertainment , studio bosses were n't willing to invest in films on these sort of topics , for they did n't think that audiences would come to see them .
Law 's second film , The Reincarnation of Golden Lotus , was a modern adaptation of a classical Chinese novel about the unusual woman Pan Jin - lian .
It was a more polished work than her first film .
" Although the story is intentionally macabre , " noted the Hong Kong critic Shek Kei , " the film displays Law 's own style and succeeds with both its twists of plot and its portrayal of desire and killing for love .
Law also does a good job of giving Joey Wang , who plays the reincarnation of an ancient Chinese courtesan , a darkly beautiful aura .
The film is visually interesting and entertaining .
Law has created a new model for shooting mythic - type Chinese films . "
Law 's third film , Farewell China , was nominated for nine Golden Horses in 1990 , and was the chief competitor of Red Dust , which won that year 's Golden Horse for best picture .
Red Dust ended up winning eight Golden Horses , and Farewell China took only three , including a best leading actor award for Tony Leung .
Nevertheless , the film received excellent notices from critics .
Although Law may have lost out in the competition for awards , the film still earned her renown .
Some , however , criticized the story for being excessively grim .
The film describes a Chinese couple who are anxious to get out of the mainland .
The wife , played by Maggie Cheung , first receives permission to leave for America .
After she gets there , her family loses all trace of her .
Her husband , played by Leung , smuggles himself into America to try to find her .
He ca n't speak English , and is penniless and destitute after his money is stolen by some homeless people .
After he accidentally kills a Chinese gangster , he meets up with a young ethnic Chinese girl and acts as her pimp , losing all dignity .
Meanwhile , his wife meets an even worse fate .
She lives in a decrepit basement , where she is raped .
In order to get a green card , she marries an old Chinese man who is a citizen , and eventually goes insane .
The various tragedies depicted in the film are rather hard to take .
One critic wrote , " The director lays on the tragedy a little too thick .
When the couple by chance meet up , one might expect a happy ending .
But instead we get a crazy woman murdering her husband in front of the Statue of Liberty .
It 's a bit over the top . "
Nevertheless , some viewers could identify with the plot .
In one scene Cheung 's character bicycles home to her run - down apartment with a discarded mattress on her back .
" When she was struggling to get out of China , she would never have expected that she would end up like this in America , " wrote one woman on the Internet .
" When I saw this film as a 20 - year - old , I thought it was rather sensational .
But when I was 25 and went to America , I discovered that it was quite true to life . "
A new tune in a foreign land
Two years later , Law applied to have her film Autumn Moon compete for a Golden Horse .
Much to her surprise , the awards committee refused her application because the film lacked a distributor in Taiwan .
Although not allowed to compete for a Golden Horse , it won the Gold Leopard Award at the Locarno Film Festival in Switzerland , and with this award Law began to receive notice in the international film community .
Autumn Moon , which was shot with Japanese money , depicts a Japanese man who goes to Hong Kong as a tourist when he is bored with his life .
He uses a video camera to make a record of his daily life there , and meets Hui , a 15 - year - old girl who is about to emigrate .
Although communication is difficult , they quickly become friends .
The girl 's parents have already emigrated to Canada , leaving her behind with her grandmother .
This " Japanese older brother " becomes her close friend , and she often takes him home to eat meals cooked by her grandmother .
The three of them talk past each other , but they are very much like a family , and these scenes are quite amusing .
The program of the Taipei Film Festival describes this successful example of a Chinese - language film shot with foreign money thus : " Law masterfully portrays the wave of emigration that preceded the 1997 handover , as well as the withering of traditional culture and the loneliness and alienation experienced by modern people . "
A year later , Law shot Temptation of a Monk , which takes as its departure point the military plots surrounding the Xuanwu Gate Incident during the Tang dynasty .
Based on a novel by Hong Kong 's Lillian Lee , the film was entirely shot in the mainland and explores themes of sexual desire and Zen Buddhism .
The locations and scenery are stunningly beautiful , and the photography and art direction top - notch .
Joan Chen , who plays two characters and actually shaved her head for the film , seduced audiences with her performances , appearing naked in several scenes .
" Nevertheless , her characters are the biggest disappointments in the whole film , " wrote the Hong Kong critic Shek Kei .
" She is n't made up to look attractive , with the result that she is n't adequately alluring .
Her princess character is not well developed , and then she suddenly becomes a widow and then a spy and assassin .
It 's all rather confusing . "
After making Autumn Moon and Temptation of a Monk , two highly stylized works , Law went back to the theme of emigration at which she excels , getting a grant from the Australian government to film Floating Life .
The result , both in terms of its visual and narrative techniques , was much more accessible .
Unlike Farewell China , which depicts a tragedy in a foreign land , Floating Life explores the problem of the generation gap between the first and second generation of Chinese emigrants and the clash between Chinese and Western culture .
The story is set on the eve of the handover of Hong Kong from Britain to the PRC .
It shows what a Hong Kong family with five children encounter when they immigrate to Australia .
Farewell Hong Kong
Floating Life was the first film that Clara Law made after moving to Australia .
" Many people just discuss Floating Life from the perspective of immigration , " Law says , " but what I really intended to show was how fleeting life is , and how people go about surviving in rootless societies . "
We should try to adopt longer - term perspectives , she says , because in the end we 're all going to meet our maker .
The vast , virgin expanses of the Australian continent have sparked a new creative fire in Law .
The Goddess of 1967 adopts such techniques used in television commercials as exaggerated contrasts of brightness , grainy film , and oversaturation of color .
" The wonderfully weird visual style differs greatly from her old works , " notes the program of the Taipei Film Festival .
" It 's the new Australian Law , not the old Hong Kong Law . "
The Australian government was quite pleased with the film made by this scriptwriting and directing couple and has chosen Floating Life to be one of eight official Australian entrants at international film festivals .
Law seems to have found new creative energy in Australia , where both her works have been about how people try to find themselves in the modern world .
" Although we do n't know where we 're going , it is our journey .
We hope that audiences will take to the road with us . "

King of Taiwan 's Snakes
- The Hundred - Pace Viper
-LRB- Chang Chin - ju / tr. by Robert Taylor -RRB-
To mark the advent of the Year of the Snake , Taiuan Publishing invited the Taiwanese public to vote for native animals to represent the 12 creatures of the Chinese zodiac .
Although Taiwan has over 50 snake species , by far the most popular choice for the snake was the hundred - pace viper .
Why is the hundred - pacer seen as the quintessential Taiwanese snake ?
And how much do we know about this endangered species which has been designated a " rare cultural resource " ?
" Every day at dusk , we heard a loud whistling sound from far off in the forest .
The old folk told us it was the voice of the hundred - pacer . . . . "
In Academia Sinica researcher Hu Tai - li 's documentary film Sounds of Love and Sorrow , released last year , about the life of veteran Paiwan nose - flautist Remaleg -LRB- Chiang Chung - hsin -RRB- , Remaleg 's son Lavuras -LRB- Chiang Cheng - hsin -RRB- recalls the poignantly beautiful sound of the hundred - pace viper as he heard it in his childhood in his old tribal village .
He also recounts that it was to imitate the sound of the hundred - pacer that the Paiwan developed the nose - flute .
Traditional Paiwan beliefs include many spirits .
The hundred - pace viper represents a guardian spirit who protects the Paiwan in their homeland around Mt. Tawu .
" It is the spirit of life , the greatest of all the spirits . "
Lavuras says that 60 % of Paiwan folk tales have to do with the hundred - pacer .
In the Paiwan village of Pingho , one of the two most important festivals was the Hundred - Pacer Festival , which used to be held once every ten years .
" In our old village , the big tree under which the hundred - pacers lay coiled up was respected like a temple , and was seen as the seat of the tribe 's soul , " Lavuras recalls .
According to aboriginal beliefs , the only way human beings can live safely on this earth is in a long - term relationship of friendship , mutual sacrifice and mutual support with the animals .
The Paiwan images of the hundred - pace viper in Lavuras ' mind have never been menacing or sinister ; they are mostly charming and beautiful .
" Perhaps today we no longer believe in them as spirits , but they are still important symbols for the people of Mt. Tawu . "
Other Taiwanese aboriginal peoples with a close relationship to the hundred - pacer are the Bunun and the Rukai .
The Bunun call the snake kaviiad , meaning " friend . "
According to Bunun lore , if one meets a hundred - pacer one need only wave a red cloth at it and it will go away .
Taiwan 's top five
However , among the Han Chinese , the hundred - pace viper is seen merely as a first - rate tonic medicine to boost male sexual powers .
Paiwan poet Monaneng has written : " The hundred - pacer is dead ; / They 've put it in a big transparent medicine jar / With ' aphrodisiac ' on the label , / To tempt men wandering among back street red lights . / The hundred - pacer of our fairytales is dead ; / We Paiwan worshipped its eggs as our ancestors , / But now they 've put it in a medicine jar / As a tool to excite urban lust . . . . "
The human tradition of eating snakes and using snakes for medicinal purposes goes back a long way .
In subtropical Taiwan , with its many native snakes , there were once snake research institutes and snake shops everywhere , and people made use of all kinds of snake products - snake meat , snake blood , snake penis , snake skin , and snake venom .
The notions that one can best " fight poison with poison , " and that the more powerful a poison , the greater its tonic effect , have long made poisonous snakes into highly valued natural products .
One in five of Taiwan 's 50 - odd species of land snakes are poisonous .
The five best known and most frequently exploited are the Taiwan habu -LRB- Trimeresurus mucrosquamatus -RRB- , the Taiwan cobra -LRB- Naja naja atra -RRB- , the Chinese green tree viper -LRB- Trimeresurus stejnegeri -RRB- , the Taiwan banded krait -LRB- Bungarus multicinctus -RRB- and the hundred - pace viper -LRB- Deinagkistrodon acutus , aka the sharp - nosed pit viper -RRB- .
Most of Taiwan 's venomous snakes live in low - altitude farmland and sparsely populated countryside .
But the hundred - pace viper , which was never very numerous , is at home in densely forested areas at low to medium elevations in the mountains of eastern , central and southern Taiwan .
It grows to one - and - a - half meters or more - much the same length as the habu and cobra - but being far thicker and meatier it is much valued by gourmands .
Since the snake is also sought after for its venom , it commands tremendously high prices .
According to the report " A Survey of the Commercial Exploitation and Hunting of Taiwanese Snakes " by Lin Hua - ching of Taipei Zoo , hundred - pace vipers sell for three times as much as Taiwan 's other poisonous snakes , and have been known to fetch upward of NT$ 10,000 per catty -LRB- 600 grams -RRB- .
During Taiwan 's period under Japanese rule , injuries caused by poisonous snakes were a frequent occurrence , so in the 1930s Tu Tsung - ming of Taihoku Imperial -LRB- later National Taiwan -RRB- University Medical College began studying poisonous snakes , and started a trend of research into snake venom antiserums .
Snake venoms contain complex combinations of enzymes , and as well as being useful for the treatment of snakebite , they have also been used as the basis for developing many new medical drugs such as anticoagulants and anesthetics .
But due to their complexity , snake venoms are not easily synthesized , so they have to be milked directly from snakes .
According to medical records of the time the hundred - pace viper caused more deaths than any other Taiwanese snake , so it became an important research topic .
Lavuras recalls that the largest numbers of hundred - pace vipers were caught in the period from the 1960s to the 1980s .
As the fingers of development pushed up into Taiwan 's mountains and forests , hundred - pacers were forced into retreat everywhere , and in 1989 the Council of Agriculture put the snake on the endangered species list .
The hundred - pacer is also the only snake species on the Council for Cultural Affairs ' list of 23 rare cultural resources .
Since then the popular custom of eating hundred - pacers has gradually declined , and by 1999 the number of hundred - pacers which the Department of Health 's Center for Disease Control -LRB- CDC -RRB- applied to have caught to make antiserum had also fallen to 30 .
Regal style
But is the hundred - pacer really the most fearsome cold - blooded killer of all Taiwan 's poisonous snakes ?
Chen Tsun - kuan , a section chief at the CDC , states that among Taiwan 's " top five " poisonous snakes , the hundred - pacer in fact has the weakest venom .
But its fangs are especially long , and it secretes the largest quantity of venom of any Taiwanese snake .
However , the hundred - pacer lives in the dark depths of the dense jungle , and its numbers are relatively small .
Not only does it take a goodly portion of luck for a snake hunter to find a hundred - pacer - the number of people unfortunate enough to be bitten by one is also very small .
One mountain lover who often encounters snakes on his hiking expeditions describes the hundred - pacer as " cool , calm and collected , " and people who have kept or observed hundred - pacers also say they " do n't lash out blindly . "
Hu Tai - li describes them as " really the chieftain among snakes - they have a serene , tolerant nature , and are not apt to attack people wantonly . "
Perhaps it is because of this regal temperament that they are revered as ancestral spirits by the Paiwan .
The hundred - pacer belongs to the viper family , which was the last of the snake families to evolve .
Unlike the more primitive pythons and blind snakes , the vipers all have venom glands .
Professor Tu Ming - chang of the biology department at National Taiwan Normal University explains that snakes evolved from hole - dwelling animals , and lacking limbs , they are less agile than most quadrupeds .
Their vision and hearing are also poor .
Hence their poison fangs are almost the only tools they have to catch food and defend themselves with .
In recent years , Tu and his research students have gradually researched the ecology of the viper species Trimeresurus gracilis , which is endemic to Taiwan , and of the Chinese green tree viper .
But few researchers have taken an interest in the hundred - pacer , which lives deep in the forest and has limited distribution .
Although it is an endangered species , lack of detailed information about such things as its reproductive cycle , preferred prey , range of activity and habits turns conservation efforts into little more than empty talk .
Cold - blooded ?
Not me !
It was only when Taipei Zoo began a hundred - pacer breeding program that people had the opportunity to understand the true face of Taiwan 's hundred - pace vipers .
Lin Hua - ching , curator of the zoo 's rescue center for amphibians and reptiles , says that the year before last there were six hundred - pacers in the rescue center which had been confiscated from a snake shop in Panchiao .
Zoo staff felt that not enough was known about the snakes ' habits for them to be successfully released back into the wild , and in order to have some substantive educational content to show visitors , they decided to start a breeding program .
" Snake Daddy " Lin Hua - ching says that as far as is known from observation of snakes in the wild , they live largely solitary lives .
Their sense of smell is an important means of communication , and in the breeding season male snakes are attracted by scents released by the females .
In late October 1999 , the zoo began putting the male and female hundred - pacers together in pairs , and one pair took a liking to each other .
The male gently courted the female by licking her head with his tongue .
For the next three weeks the couple were inseparable , after which they gradually returned to their solitary lifestyles .
In February of last year , the female snake 's belly gradually began to swell , and an ultrasound examination confirmed she was pregnant .
In the two weeks after she laid her eggs , the female hundred - pacer protected them vigorously .
Not daring to anger her , the zoo staff waited for her maternal instincts to subside somewhat before removing the eggs .
In August last year , as Taiwan was being buffeted by a typhoon , over 20 eggs hatched out into tiny snakes , which the zoo hopes can grow up safe and sound .
During this first breeding session , for fear of anything going wrong with the pregnancy the zoo staff disturbed the mother snake as little as possible .
But Lin Hua - ching says that next time around they will gather more detailed data , such as weighing the female snake every week , to make a comprehensive record of the breeding process .
Hear the hundred - pacer 's voice
However , no matter how many hundred - pacers we can see at the zoo on future visits , it is obvious that we can not fully understand them just by seeing them in captivity .
When Lavuras mentioned at a Symposium on Amphibian and Reptile Ecology and Conservation held by Taipei Zoo last year that the Paiwan used their nose - flutes to imitate the voice of the hundred - pace viper , all the biologists present said they had never heard a hundred - pacer make a sound .
Lavuras asked the scholars bluntly where they had seen hundred - pacers .
If it was in the zoo , the snakes were away from their natural environment .
But even if it was in the wild , with the great environmental changes of modern times the snakes might have been " struck dumb " too !
Whether hundred - pacers really do have a voice is an unanswered question of biology .
But perhaps the aborigines ' open attitude toward and involvement in the natural world , as revealed in their legend of the nose flute , is something even harder to imagine for modern people who received a rationalist education and operate in a mechanized culture .
Perhaps in this Year of the Snake , the hundred - pacer , just like the Paiwan people who also still live in close communion with nature , is singing us some long - forgotten songs of life - if only you are willing to listen with your soul .

Emigrating to Shanghai : A Veteran Shares His Experience
-LRB- Chuang Chih / tr. by David Mayer -RRB-
The prospect of emigrating to Shang - hai has caught the imagination of middle - class Taiwanese in recent years , and waves of business persons have been pouring into Shanghai since the early 1990s .
But is that really such a good idea ?
What happens when a Taiwanese expatriate settles in Shanghai ?
Taiwanese businessman Chen Pin , who moved to Shanghai a decade ago , has written of his experiences in Emigrating to Shanghai , which has sold like hotcakes since it was published just last October by Shang Hsun Cultural Publishing Company .
When you think of Shanghai , what comes to mind ?
The grand promenade and European - style buildings along the Bund ?
The bustling shopping district where foreigners congregated in the days of the foreign concessions ?
Du Yuesheng and his notorious Shanghai Green Gang ?
The novels of Eileen Chang ?
Big city , tricky ropes
Chen Pin opened his first business in Shanghai over ten years ago .
In the intervening years he has run a bread factory , restaurants , and a fast food shop .
His son is treated as a PRC citizen , and attends university in Shanghai .
A survivor of many ups and downs himself , Chen gives detailed descriptions of many of the problems faced by Taiwanese business persons in the mainland .
The book describes the property market , cross-strait marriage , starting a business , children 's education , shopping , recreation , and more .
He does not stop at mere description , however .
He also offers suggestions on how to cope with a wide range of difficulties .
This book can serve as a " how to " manual for those who would follow in this footsteps .
Chen offers a lot of very useful insights into the Shanghai property market .
All land is owned by the state , so when you buy a building , you do n't gain outright ownership .
All you get is the right to use it .
Property in Shanghai is divided into various categories , and Chen explains various terms used in the PRC .
" Foreign business buildings " can be purchased by foreign - invested enterprises and persons with a foreign passport .
Buildings sold on the domestic market to PRC firms are called shang pin fang , or literally , " commercial buildings . "
Buildings owned by the state are called gong fang , or " public buildings . "
Buildings owned by private individuals are called si fang , or " private buildings . "
If you 've paid all your property taxes , you are given a da chan zheng , or " big " property certificate .
If you have n't yet paid , you can only get a " small " property certificate , and you ca n't sell your property .
Some buildings can be bought with a loan , but others ca n't .
Newly arrived Taiwanese business persons often make bad judgments if they plunge into the market without studying it carefully first , so Chen suggests the following rules of thumb : The Shanghai property market is in a slump , so there is no need to rush into a purchase .
A buyer must be very clear about the purpose of any property purchase .
It is safest to buy property from the Shanghai Municipal Government , the biggest and most reliable real estate developer in the city .
One must not estimate potential earnings on the basis of experience in Taiwan .
You get more for money when renting than when buying .
You must stand on your rights at all times , and be very careful not to let friends and relatives use their personal ties to take advantage of you .
Secrets to success
When hard - charging Taiwanese businessmen meet up with their smooth - talking Shanghai counterparts , the Taiwanese often come away with the short end of the stick .
From the vendors at open - air markets hawking crabs or pears , to the proprietors of five - star clubs that target a foreign clientele , everyone in Shanghai looks at Taiwanese business persons the same way :
" Oh boy , here comes an easy mark !
Let 's skin him alive ! "
Chen laments , " The old lady at the market sells beans to everybody else at 80 cents per jin , but she jacks up the price on me to two dollars . "
And this is only a cut - and - dried business transaction .
Personal relationships and marriage get a lot more complicated .
Taiwanese men tend to fall like a ton of bricks for the pretty , sweet - talking women in Shanghai , and that signals the beginning of all sorts of problems .
Single men practically shout it out : " My girlfriend is in Shanghai . "
Those who already have wives in Taiwan will tell you in a low whisper : " I 've got a mistress in Shanghai , and I 'm taking care of all her expenses . "
The women of Shanghai are well known for their liberated ways , and it is no simple matter for Taiwanese men there to handle their business and emotional affairs wisely .
Chen argues that allowing direct travel between Taiwan and the mainland would make it much more difficult for Taiwanese men to keep mistresses in the mainland , and would go a long way toward clearing up all the cross-strait marital and romantic problems that now occur so often .
Chen offers several pieces of advice for all who would head for Shanghai , whether alone or with their families .
Shopping :
" You should establish a reputation for being tight - fisted . "
When you buy things , pretend not to have as much money as they 're demanding .
Ask questions , and keep asking until you get clear answers before you pay anybody any money .
Also , keeping a low profile is a means of self - defense .
You should be careful not to flaunt knowledge or ability .
General attitude :
" The Taiwanese are considered uncultured boors in spite of their wealth .
Live down that image .
Be humble .
Get to know the daily lives of people in Shanghai . "
Looking out for No. 1 :
" You must understand that undercurrents in Shanghai are strong .
It 's hard to stay afloat , and many people enjoy watching your struggle ; they 're hoping you 'll go under .
You have to understand the legal systems and government policies .
You have to know how to operate under the table .
Markets change overnight , and personal relationships are ambiguous .
Trust no one , for no one is looking to save you a penny or help you earn a bit extra .
You 're on your own . "
You 're not in Taiwan anymore
In both emotional and historical terms , Shanghai seems very near , but in fact it is a very unfamiliar place .
Our dreams , yearnings , and imaginings blind us to the truth , and this especially true of Taiwanese business persons .
The book 's subtitle , A Meeting of " the Taiwanese Experience " and Shanghai Style , hints at the conflicts inherent in the relationship .
Although the people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait share a common language and ethnicity , our long separation has given rise to sharply divergent values and ways of thinking .
When someone from Shanghai says , " This is n't a big problem , " you have to realize that he has just acknowledged that there 's a problem , and it 's up to you to figure out how serious it really is .
Taiwanese ways do n't fly in Shanghai .
Do you want to eat the famous steamed mantou buns at Nanxiang Restaurant ?
Shop for antiques ?
Visit Zhouzhuang , the so - called " Venice of the Orient " ?
Before you take off , do your homework .
Shanghai is a big city , after all , and there are plenty of " crouching dragons and hidden tigers " lurking in the shadows .

James Soong Gets a Message :
Show Us the Money !
-LRB- Eric Lin / tr. by Phil Newell -RRB-
In December there was an unexpected shock in the presidential election race .
The shock did not come from the announcement on the 10th by Democratic Progressive Party candidate Chen Shui - bian that his running mate would be Annette Lu -LRB- this was expected -RRB- , but rather from revelations about mystery funds which embroiled independent candidate James Soong .
Soong , who had been far ahead in public opinion polls , has suffered a severe blow from the so - called " Chung Hsing Case , " and his support has dropped markedly , so that now Chen and Kuomintang candidate Lien Chan are running neck - and - neck with him .
Indeed , the aftershocks of the case have not subsided .
On December 22 , Minister of Finance Paul Chiu , responding to interpellations in the Legislative Yuan , officially announced some findings of the investigation into major securities trading by Soong Chen - yuan , the son of James Soong .
Most important were revelations about accounts held in the names of Soong family members .
Legislator Yang Chi - hsiung had uncovered two funds , valued at NT$ 140 million and $ 470 million , under the names of Soong Chen - yuan and James Soong 's sister - in - law Chen Pi - yun .
In addition , said Minister Chiu , there were other accounts , the largest of which reached as high as NT$ 300 million in value .
The Taipei District Prosecutor 's Office then opened its own investigation .
It collected evidence from the Ministry of Finance , the Bank of Taiwan , Chung Hsing Bills Finance , and other institutions .
After tracing the flow of money , it then called in Chen Pi - yun and Soong Chen - yuan for questioning .
Faced with outside scepticism , James Soong then asked New Party legislator Hsieh Chi - ta to form an audit team and investigate .
On December 28 , Hsieh held a press conference to relate the results of the audit , in which he explained when the accounts were opened , how they were used , and what the flow of the money was .
At the press conference , Chen Pi - yun stated that there was nearly NT$ 1 billion from several sources , including more than NT$ 400 million left over from funds collected for Soong 's campaign for provincial governor -LRB- which , according to the law , Soong could retain -RRB- , NT$ 300 million provided by the provincial water conservancy authorities for a fund to train water conservancy specialists , more than NT$ 140 million in funds provided by the KMT for " party operations , " more than NT$ 100 million for the purpose of looking after the descendants of the late president Chiang Ching - kuo , and more than NT$ 14 million in family savings .
The funds were used , according to Hsieh 's audit , to support election campaigns of provincial assemblymen , to support the election campaign of current president Lee Teng - hui , to pay business expenses for James Soong , to establish a scholarship fund for students to go the University of California at Berkeley , and to support Soong Chen - yuan in his studies and business activities in the US .
A final version of Hsieh 's findings is to be provided to the investigating authorities .
However , Chen Pi - yun provided no reasonable explanation of the key question : Why were public funds mixed up with and deposited along with private funds in the Soong family 's private accounts ?
Soong , who participated in Hsieh 's press conference , then declared that the mixing of public and private funds was done on the orders of party chairman Lee Teng - hui for purposes of " security , reliability , secrecy , and avoiding trouble . "
After the Hsieh - Chen - Soong press conference , the KMT held its own .
Party spokesperson Huang Hui - chen said that the KMT had never officially authorized Soong to have or use these funds , and that Soong was suspected of embezzlement .
A judicial investigation will be required to look into this .
So how did all this start ?
On December 9 legislator Yang Chi - hsiung held a press conference at which he stated that Soong Chen - yuan had opened a securities trading account at Chung Hsing Bills Finance , that in December of 1992 , Soong Chen - yuan purchased NT$ 106 million in securities , and that as of the date of the press conference , there was more than NT$ 140 million in securities in the account .
Yang wondered how Soong Chen - yuan , who had just graduated from university , could possess such a large amount of wealth .
James Soong thereafter stated that after his son had gone abroad to study and start a business , a benevolent " elder " opened an account which would allow the younger Soong to withdraw funds from the interest as needed .
Over the years , there was no special need for the money , and last June NT$ 140 million was returned .
As for who this " elder " is , Soong would not say .
But scepticism persisted .
On December 15 , Soong held a press conference at which he stated that the account in his son 's name was set up under the direction of KMT party chairman Lee Teng - hui .
He said that NT$ 146,460,000 was transferred from the special account of the KMT Secretary - General and deposited in accounts under the names of Soong Chen - yuan and Chen Pi - yun .
The money was designated , said Soong , to take care of the descendants of former president Chiang Ching - kuo , and for " party tasks " specially designated by the chairman .
Soong said that the amounts announced by Yang were inaccurate .
Soong held a second press conference on December 18 .
This time he declared only that the money had been intended for looking after the Chiang family .
On December 21 , Legislator Yang held his third press conference , in which he stated that Soong 's sister - in - law , Chen Pi - yun , had , in a half - month period at the end of 1994 and the beginning of 1995 , used NT$ 470 million in cash to purchase bonds and securities at Chung Hsing .
Under pressure from the public and legislators , on December 22 Minister of Finance Chiu announced partial results of their investigation , as mentioned above .
This in turn sparked Soong to ask Hsieh Chi - ta for another audit .
There have been no firm conclusions as yet .
The Chung Hsing case may or may not be fully clarified , but it has certainly greatly affected James Soong 's public support .
Before the scandal broke , he was getting more than 30 % support in public opinion polls , but a December 20 poll by the China Times shows Soong with only 23 % .
This leaves him behind Chen Shui - bian -LRB- 24 % -RRB- and barely ahead of Lien Chan -LRB- 22 % -RRB- .
Yet , while Soong 's support has fallen , that of Chen and Lien has not markedly increased .
Obviously former Soong supporters are now taking a wait - and - see attitude .
There 's a final point worth reflecting on : This is only the second direct election for the president in the history of the ROC .
Yet the personal characters of the candidates and those around them have already become the main focus of public attention .
There 's little discussion of public policy .
For example , there 's been virtually no response to the white papers on China policy and constitutional reform issued by Chen Shui - bian .
What is wrong with Taiwan 's democratic culture ?
Do the public and media need to reassess ?
After all , in the new millennium , there will be many more tests facing us .

Administration Accused of Political Surveillance
The Investigators Reform Association , which was formed in early September , set off a political firestorm by accusing the administration of following in the footsteps of its Kuomintang predecessor by carrying out politically motivated surveillance of opposition figures in the name of national security .
The Office of the President , National Security Bureau , Ministry of Justice , and Investigation Bureau have all denied the charges , and President Chen stated , " I have never instructed security organs to carry out surveillance against specific individuals since assuming the presidency , and I have never even seen the so - called ' National Security Daily . ' "
The Association has stuck to its guns , however , and insists that the situation has not improved .
Controversy continues to swirl .
For a government that stresses human rights , this is an issue that can not be ignored .
The IRA leveled its accusations at a press conference called to announce the group 's formation on September 9 .
In addition to expressing support for reform of the justice system 's intelligence gathering organs , the IRA accused the new administration of carrying out surveillance of members of opposition parties and persons viewed as rivals to the president .
The administration has allegedly focused especially on KMT party chairman Lien Chan , People 's First Party chairman James Soong , DPP chairman Frank Hsieh , and Taipei mayor Ma Ying - jeou .
IRA deputy chairman Su Yu - chi stated that abuse of investigative powers continues unabated today .
Explaining the " chain of command " behind the surveillance , Su said that the Office of the President usually gets the ball rolling with an explicit or implied command to the National Security Bureau -LRB- NSB -RRB- , which relays instructions to the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau -LRB- MJIB -RRB- .
Most investigations focus on political information on members of opposition parties .
The IRA has drafted a " Law for Neutrality and Supervision of Intelligence Organs " in order to : -LRB- 1 -RRB- require that intelligence organs maintain strict political neutrality ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- define clear jurisdictional boundaries between different intelligence organs ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- ensure proper supervision of their activities .
The IRA 's accusations have elicited strong reactions .
Taipei mayor Ma Ying - jeou was angered to learn that intelligence organs would abuse their power by carrying out political surveillance against the Taipei City Government .
KMT chairman Lien Chan and PFP chairman James Soong stated that surveillance of political parties runs counter to the spirit of democracy .
DPP chairman Frank Hsieh also voiced concern , pointing out that when he recently canceled a proposed visit to Xiamen the news media had access to confidential information related to the matter .
Hsieh called on the president to explain how the information could have leaked .
According to Eugene Chien , deputy secretary - general to the president , national security organs are required by law to collect and analyze information related to national security and cross-strait relations .
Information and analyses are forwarded to the president for his reference , said Chien , but no one focuses on particular individuals or political parties .
The NSB also released a statement stressing that the information it collects is mostly related to matters that affect national security or pose a potential national security threat .
As for the accusation that the NSB carries out politically motivated surveillance , the NSB stated that " gathering intelligence on national affairs " is one of its legally defined responsibilities .
To the extent that its investigations focus on political matters , what the NSB is concerned about is the government 's performance of its duties , maintenance of order during elections , and cross-strait relations .
The NSB said it never carries out surveillance of individuals .
These statements have not allayed suspicions , however .
In fact , they have actually stirred up further controversy .
Drawing on the term " White Terror , " which refers to political persecution carried out by the KMT government during the 38 - year period of martial law , the three main opposition parties in the legislature have criticized the new administration for carrying out a " Green Terror " campaign -LRB- a reference to the green color of the DPP flag -RRB- .
PFP spokesman Sun Ta - chien alleged that ten persons have been targeted for special attention , and said that information on their activities is delivered to the president in a report nicknamed the " National Security Daily . "
Chen Shui - bian responded publicly to the charges for the first time in his monthly press conference on September 16 .
Chen denied instructing security organs to carry out surveillance against specific individuals , and said that he has never seen the so - called " National Security Daily . "
He further indicated that he has instructed all security organs that they " are not to carry out surveillance against specific political parties or individuals . "
At the same time , said the president , these organs must be diligent in all matters related to national security , economic security , major criminal activity , maintenance of social order , and any other matters that fall within their legal jurisdiction .
MJIB director Wang Kuang - yu assured DPP legislators on September 18 that his organization will redefine its mission to eliminate the category of " intelligence gathering , " which has stirred up so much controversy .
Instead , said Wang , the MJIB will concentrate on " investigating criminal activities and countering the attempts of individuals -LRB- and organizations -RRB- from mainland China and foreign countries to infiltrate or spy on Taiwan . "
Questions concerning the proper role and jurisdiction of the MJIB have reopened public debate on political surveillance .
The MJIB is responsible for both political intelligence gathering and criminal investigations , and is nominally under the Ministry of Justice .
Its work overlaps with that of the NSB , and the existence of two different chains of command inevitably creates problems .
The IRA has pointed out , for example , that MJIB investigators often receive oral instructions from the NSB to collect information on a particular political party .
The Ministry of Justice , in the meantime , repeatedly calls upon the MJIB to stop doing work not related to national security or crime prevention , and demands that they maintain strict political neutrality .
Investigators complain that they do n't know who to listen to , and it is difficult for them to concentrate on their work and play their proper role in the justice system .
The intelligence apparatus is supposedly subject to supervision by the legislature , which wields budgetary authority over these agencies and has the power to review internal administrative documents that do not contain classified information .
In reality , however , intelligence operations are extremely secretive , and legislators can do little to hold them in check .
Taiwan now faces two very pressing tasks related to its intelligence operations .
The jurisdiction of the MJIB , for one thing , must be clarified .
And secondly , our domestic intelligence activities must be subject to effective oversight so that no government of any stripe will ever again engage in repression of its political opponents .
The Age of the Peacock
" God gives a woman one face ; she can make another one for herself . "
This well - known expression is being amended by the behavior of men in the 21st century .
The " male beauty pageant " at Chiao Tung University just ended , and it was quickly followed by a website male beauty contest .
Modern males not only are competing over looks , they also are competing over dressing themselves up and making themselves over .
In his book The Art of Life , the humorist Lin Yutang noted how " commercial advertising has commodified virtually every inch of a woman 's body , right down to the last line and the last painted toenail . "
Now when you look at advertising billboards or magazines , you see men displaying their oiled - up muscles , shiny white teeth , smooth and clean - shaven skin , and elegant attire .
The " new man " is making himself over from head to toe , and is not averse to showing a more feminine side in doing so .
Men are invading territory previously held exclusively by women , and are declaring : " Ladies , you no longer have a monopoly on making yourselves beautiful ! "
" This summer , before putting on your shorts and sandals , be sure to do skin care treatment and thoroughly clean your legs , so that you can present a fresh clean image to people . "
You would probably assume that this is an ad for a woman 's beauty product , would n't you ?
A men 's fashion magazine that sells over 10,000 copies per month in convenience stores cautions its male readers that if they want to have the " face of an angel , " then every day they must do " three - step skin care " to rid themselves of dead skin cells .
Men can now retain their youthful looks with moisturizing masks , wrinkle - removing patches , and techniques for tightening facial skin and giving the lines of the face a more pronounced depth .
Of course , after facial care is finished , do n't forget to rub moisturizing cream into your calves !
Everywhere advertisements are promoting the idea of the " peacock . "
They are encouraging modern men to take practical steps to " decorate " themselves .
The American cosmetics company Clinique had sales over NT$ 1 million in the first month in which they released men 's skin care products in Taiwan .
Chu Che - tao , the company 's director of education and training , declares : " The market potential for male skin - care products is unlimited . "
Phone calls and Internet inquiries from men asking about beauty products and services are outpacing the capacity of the industry to handle them .
Angela Chiang , general manager of Access Cosmetics International , the Taiwan agent for a number of imported perfumes , says that Taiwan 's male fragrance market began to grow markedly in 1998 .
Last year , some of the leading brands showed sales increases of 200 % .
Many male clients have three or four different kinds of fragrance at home , using different ones for the office , long weekends , and so on .
In days gone by , it was considered an extravagance for Dad to go down to the barbershop for a shave and haircut .
Today beauty parlors are offering these aging gents the chance to lighten their spots , change their profiles , and have their wrinkles pulled away .
One salon in Hsinchu called Modern Man Salon has adopted the slogan : " Men and women are finally equal . "
The determination of men in Taiwan to redo themselves is rising .
Men are giving away nothing to their sisters in the search for beautiful bodies , as is suggested by a few recent disputes between male beauty salons and dissatisfied customers .
According to statistics from early March 2000 from the Wanfang Hospital Laser Center , last year the ratio of men to women going for cosmetic surgery was 1 : 3 , compared to 1 : 5 just five years ago .
Lai Hsien - hung , a physician at the center , predicts that before long the ratio will reach 1 : 1 .
Show me the body
It is frequently argued that it is a male - dominated society that creates the need for women to spend money making themselves up as if their lives depended on it .
But who should get the " credit " for this new male infatuation with beauty ?
Besides the fact that advertising and sales pitches in a modern commercial society " seduce " some men into falling into the beauty trap , many observers suggest that a major force behind male vanity are women , especially the women closest to individual men .
Betty Wu , a famous author and television host , says that today seven out of ten modern guys who buy name - brand fashions and use cosmetics do so under the influence of their girlfriends .
Wu has found that " modern men can in fact easily accept change . "
Indeed , as consumers men are often easier to deal with than women , as they are more decisive about purchasing .
When Taiwan was a primarily agricultural , then primarily industrial , society , most men lived off physical labor .
Few bothered to worry about their external appearance .
Even office workers dressed the same every day for years on end .
Of course , rich kids had the ability to dress up , but they were generally seen as playboys or dandies .
But women have had enough of that , and these days have the economic wherewithal to do something about it .
In the past , women could only be recipients of gifts from men , but now they are able to buy gifts to give to their male partners .
Women are very familiar with the cosmetics market , and are now influencing the consumer behavior of their husbands and boyfriends .
With a little help from women , men 's fashions have taken off :
" Virtually all the major men 's fashion brands have been brought into Taiwan in the last five years , " say Justin Lin , editor - in - chief of Men 's Uno , a well - known fashion magazine .
In the past , when foreign companies would release men 's and women 's fashion lines at the same time , Taiwan importers would only bring in the women 's clothing ; now men 's and women 's attire comes in together .
Men also are increasingly feeling pushed by women in the realm of cosmetic surgery and body shaping .
Many men have been encouraged by their wives to get surgery to change their single-fold eyelids to double-fold , or to have fat removed by liposuction .
One mother brought her middle school son to Lin Ching - yun 's cosmetic surgery hospital , saying : " I could n't give birth to a good nose for you , but at least I can have a good nose made for you . "
Macho macho man
In the view of Betty Wu , the reason men are daring to enter the ranks of beauty lovers , and even accept softer and more feminine standards of beauty , is because expectations of men in society have changed .
The women of Generation X , born after 1965 , have economic independence , and no longer are looking to men to support them and their children .
Thus they no longer are looking for someone who " walks and talks like a real man . "
In the past , the definition of " a real man " was usually one who could support a wife and children , and who would play the active role in a relationship , with the woman being the passive partner .
Since more and more women do not expect a man to support them , what they are looking for in a man has also changed .
Wu croons , " We want men to be more juicy . "
In the past it was no big deal if your male partner was n't really presentable , but now an important condition for a boyfriend is that one is not embarrassed to take him out in public .
Says Wu : " I just do n't understand what my mother saw in John Wayne in his dirty old jeans .
" In the past women wanted to be coddled , now they want to coddle men .
Guys who evoke a woman 's sympathetic instincts and " non-threatening " types of " pretty boys " are becoming more and more popular .
Lucia Lee , a young office worker who regularly discusses social trends with webfriends on her own website , says that modern males no longer have that rough - tough character ; guys like Hsieh Ting - feng and Chen Hsiao - tung , who never have a hair out of place , are very popular male idols these days .
When well - groomed male stars stand on stage next to their female counterparts , they both look equally " juicy . "
Relax dudes
Social change is permitting women to devote more attention to admiring male beauty , and it also is allowing men to enjoy beautifying themselves .
Ning Yin - bin , an associate professor in the Graduate Institute of Philosophy at National Central University , and an expert on gender issues , says that for a long time " society did not encourage men to spend time making themselves up or becoming more attractive to others . "
The role society assigned to men emphasized accomplishments in the outside world , so it was only legitimate for men to learn how to make a living .
Wang Hao - wei , a psychiatrist who frequently writes on the subject of men in Taiwan , says that guys by nature find it hard to reveal their softer sides .
They can only put down their body armor after slugging a few drinks down .
Today , they 're getting a chance to express themselves through external beauty , and can show a softer side .
He Tu - lin , a tall and handsome television star , declared his own opinion - without the least bashfulness about it - on a recent radio program :
" The key factor allowing men to have the courage to display their own bodies is that they see their bodies as their own .
Their bodies no longer belong to a cultural tradition or to other people .
As men love themselves more , they can transfer some of this self - love to their bodies .
As a result , modern men have discovered that can they can make a statement about themselves through their clothes and their bodies . "
Whether awakened to a new sense of their own bodies by popular culture , or driven to stay at the forefront of commercial fashion , contemporary men have certainly made a firm decision to make themselves more beautiful .
Moreover , as the service industry has come to dominate the economy , a fresh and clean appearance - with absolutely none of that macho sweat thing allowed - has become considered simply good manners .
Many of the young men one might consider " vain " say that they only bother to create an immaculate external appearance because they need to look sharp for their jobs .
Yet , simply not smelling repulsive is hardly enough to satisfy these men .
A case in point :
Last year , Singtsufang Enterprise imported specially made underwear from Japan that gives a guy that " tight butt " look .
They originally anticipated that the stock would sell out only by October , but in fact it went six months earlier .
Kao -LRB- Taiwan -RRB- Corporation recently did a " millennial masculinity survey " in which 70 % of male respondents said that they could accept the idea of a man wearing cosmetics .
Many foreign manufacturers and advertisers are rubbing their hands in gleeful anticipation of getting a share of this market .
Chen Yen - ying , director of public relations planning for Kao , says that this year at least four companies will begin marketing skin care products for men .
From the celebrity advertisements in subway stations and on the sides of buses , you can see that in terms of market leaders like trendy fashions , hair styling , body sculpting , face care , and even undergarments , there is a tremendous amount of scope for a more diversified selection of products for men .
Androgynous zone
Ideally , businesses and popular culture want to be able to sweep everyone up in a single net , and would prefer not to break their market up by gender .
It happens that many modern guys who go in for dressing up are also showing a trend toward androgynous standards of beauty .
In fact , says Betty Wu , it is not only now that androgynous standards of beauty are starting to take root in Taiwan .
Although everyone has a different aesthetic sense , and there are many kinds of beauty , " you can still identify certain trends , " she says .
" Some years the look is the tough , hard - nosed type , and other years a softer , more feminine look is in . "
Look at some of the stars of early films in Taiwan , like Chin Han , Chin Hsiang - lin , and Liu Wen - zheng , who had a definite elegance .
" They were tall and well - built , but very gentle , " opines Wu .
These days , more and more women , in appreciating men , think that the " prettier " the guys are , the better .
Justin Lin , in his analysis of the pretty - boy phenomenon , avers : In the 1990s , the general trend of all cutting - edge design was " super-youth . "
Many well - established products appealing to the upper middle - class found it impossible to resist the trend toward youth and had to change their own design and style .
Looking around , you can see a transition in the most popular types of male models .
The muscle man and the James Dean type are on the way out .
More and more the models are of the soft , almost feminine schoolboy type , the boy next - door type , or boys who look childish and underdeveloped , as if they lack experience .
You could say that people just got tired of looking at macho men and cool dudes .
But as Wang Hao - wei sees it , the deeper cause of the current worship of ever - greater youthfulness in modern society can be traced to the dissolution of the traditional family structure .
Elders , who held all the power in the past , have become targets of derision .
Businesses have no choice but to go along with the trend .
Wang concludes : " In a society in which individualism is important , youth is the best security . "
Besides adapting to rising individualism , ever - alert commercial culture is also taking advantage of feminism and homosexual self - awareness .
Cross-gender thinking is influencing the way men make themselves appear .
This is especially apparent in the entertainment community , which sets the pace for popular culture and is often the fastest to pick up on new trends .
Many in that field are crossing traditional barriers between male and female .
In the past only women had sequins , embroidery , or skin - revealing gaps as part of their clothing , but now these are being put in men 's clothing as well .
Recently , the top four Hong Kong male singing stars were seen on stage competing for attention while wearing skirts .
You can expect that it wo n't be long before you can admire some guy on the street wearing a skirt .
The new generation of young women mostly have a positive attitude toward androgynous beauty .
As Lucia Lee says , " raw masculinity or raw femininity is of course attractive , but the more diversified is the pursuit of beauty , the more interesting the world is .
As far as I 'm concerned , if a guy wants to wear a skirt or have long hair , as long as it looks good , anything goes . "
The Non-no set
Male beauty is tending toward youth and gender neutrality , and those pursuing beauty are mainly young .
They are the ones who most dare to and who can afford to .
Chen Ta - wei , a 28 - year - old webpage designer , says that in his generation the girls grew up reading Non-no and the boys grew up reading Men 's Non-no .
Fashion magazines taught him to accept more colorful and cuter clothing , and now he knows name - brand fashions like the back of his hand .
Though he has already entered the working world , he still pays close attention to the men 's fashions introduced into magazines .
" This year Prada is putting out purple shoes that cost about NT$ 20 - 30,000 .
Doc Marten 's millennial commemorative shoes have a similar style , but the price is much lower .
I 'm thinking about buying the latter . "
Girls who grew up reading Non-no can accept the consumer attitude of the Men 's Non-no crowd .
Both groups follow fashion closely , exchange information , and raise new ideas .
" I do n't work out to build muscles , but to define them .
Right now shape is what 's in .
With a little bit of muscle , your clothes look even better . "
Chen Ta - wei also has his own ideas about the skin care products on the market :
" Men 's skin care products all assume that men have oily skin with built up dead skin cells , so they have very strong cleaning agents .
But these can damage your skin .
I prefer to use softer women 's skin tonic . "
Cabula Chang , associate managing editor at ChinaTimes.com , who is now 40 , has a brother eight years younger than himself .
He says that if he is the last of the " a - man 's - life - is - hard " generation , his younger brother will unfortunately be of a set whose lives will be even harder down the road .
This is because his younger brother , who invests an hour a day decking himself out , spends virtually all his money on clothing and pleasure .
Liu Hsiang , a PhD candidate who also teaches at an English supplementary school , says that it is certainly necessary to spend time and money if you want to give your exterior appearance a little character .
The materials of the clothes and the hairstyle have to be just right .
And some labels do indeed represent quality .
Liu , who clears out his closet for each new season , currently has 25 pairs of shoes , and more than 30 shirts .
He feels that the expression " there are no ugly women , only lazy women " can equally be applied to men , so he also encourages his friends to pay more attention to their appearance to give people a better impression .
It has been said that " power is the greatest aphrodisiac , " and this is still true .
But in the past , men with status simply neglected their physical appearance .
Today 's younger generation is n't content with knowing that they have power or ability ; young men today care about the impression they make on the outside as well .
Beauty is an acquired trait
Some feel that the arrival of " the age of the peacock " is simply a reflection of the frivolousness of the younger generation .
Public commentary was quite reserved on the incident of " Chiao Tung University has no handsome guys " and the subsequent " male beauty pageant " earlier this year .
But , counters Chen Tsai - ching , director of guidance counseling at the Lungshan Middle School , it is in the nature of young people in whatever era to worry about their looks .
As she sees it , young people are no more vain now than they were in the past .
It 's just that society is more open , and adults are more tolerant .
They no longer have a negative , repressive attitude , and therefore young people are more daring about expressing themselves .
Ko Ching - ming , a professor of Chinese at National Taiwan University who is in his fifties , says , " I grew up with compulsory haircuts and school uniforms . "
In the past , both boys and girls were required to keep their external appearance " non-provocative . "
The new generation has more opportunities to express individuality through appearance .
In the youth sub-culture that aims for rebelliousness , dyed hair and pierced ears have become trademarks .
Ko sees this simply as the diversified choice that is available in a pluralistic society .
" There 's no need to see it as an indicator of morality . "
Chang Shao - yu , a second year medical student at National Taiwan University , says that in fact beauty is learned .
Some of his classmates are able to achieve a certain look without really investing too much effort simply because their parents devoted a lot of attention to clothes .
" The kids from my family , on the other hand , have to figure it out for ourselves . "
His voice carries a tinge of regret .
He and his mother rarely went shopping together or discussed how to evaluate the quality of clothes .
Chang , who takes note of how others dress and of how fashions are matched in store displays , says that the point is not for parents to teach their children to be slaves to fashion , but to teach them how to dress with a sense of character and beauty .
Whether or not you find this behavior among some men acceptable , it is an established fact .
Tsai Shih - ping , a " pretty boy " from the literary world who is now his 40s , sighs : " This is a new era , and men really can make a statement with their bodies .
From a certain point of view , I believe that many men around my age feel very jealous , and even a sense of loss , when we see young guys with their personalized photo albums and their dressing up . "
Dress for success ?
There is more at work here , however , than just looking good , and many men now feel , as many women have long felt , that dressing up is forced on them by society .
Wang Hao - wei notes that in this generation people are increasingly forced into situations in which appearance matters - for example , on the lecture podium , or in front of the TV camera or the camera lens .
People need a greater sense of self - confidence , and feel more and more uncomfortable with their bodies .
So they strive more and more to recover lost confidence by enhancing their external appearance .
" If you do n't have looks , and you ca n't dress well , you wo n't even be able to find a job as a clerk in a clothing store , which is ranked as one of the lowest status job categories , " says Chen Ta - wei .
Go to a clothing store and check it out for yourself -
you wo n't find any ugly guys working there .
In fact , there is still a lot of discrimination in our society based on appearance .
It is not only the young who want to look better , and it seems the attitudes of the kids are affecting their elders at home .
Besides supporting their families , guys in their 40s are also starting to worry about whether they are looking old , and whether their beer - guts are starting to show .
So they too are joining the ranks of those seeking cosmetic surgery and skin care treatments .
Men 's Uno had one article which said : In the past , Western guys lived for sun , sea , and sex .
These days , they think about how the sun causes skin cancer , the sea is filled with oil spills , and sex can be fatal .
Thus a beautiful body , appropriate diet , and healthy recreation have become the new pursuits .
Part of the reason middle - aged men seek better looks is also health , with health now encompassing the realm of skin care and looks as well .
Ning Yin - bin suggests that it is hard to generalize about which group or groups are in the " beauty - loving set . "
He points to the fact that even politicians are playing this game .
In this visual age , politics is closely tied in with performance .
Male politicians are careful about their appearance and attire .
With the help of male beauty salons , skin care products , and cosmetic surgery , these middle - aged men can also win the support of strangers just from their external appearance .
Lin Ching - yun , who often helps politicians with their images , says frankly that many politicos come to have their wrinkles and the bags under their eyes removed before they go for photo sessions .
And many government officials who often appear on TV have been patients in her cosmetic surgery clinic .
The book , Dear , I Want You to Look Good For Me is billing itself as " the first book of sartorial philosophy against which men can measure themselves . "
The book declares that as Taiwan moves toward internationalization , men are constantly required to appear in public places or at social gatherings , so that dressing up is no longer a monopoly of women .
Playboys , not chauvinists
The rapidity with which ideas and fads spread in a wealthy information society means that a love of beauty is not limited to one gender , and body - sculpting does not distinguish between young and old .
Last year , a survey by Tung 's Foundation discovered that the gender / age cohort most concerned about comparisons between their bodies and others ' is men aged 60 and above .
They ranked higher than women or any other age group of men on " willingness to pay money to preserve or enhance physique " and " attention devoted to changes in physique . "
The Foundation 's suggested explanation is that these men were focused on their careers when they were younger , and they are only turning their attention to their appearance as they get older .
The new generation , on the other hand , strikes a balance between career and appearance .
This is not necessarily a bad thing .
In the eyes of feminists , the arrival of the era of male preening has added a number of interesting possibilities to the game of mutual admiration between the sexes .
But besides lustful appreciation there is a deeper question :
Do the " peacocks " who have been influenced in part by feminist consciousness " have any different ideas or make any adjustments with regard to their roles in relations between the sexes ? "
Not necessarily , it appears .
He Tu - lin , a staunch advocate of male body autonomy , did an advertisement once for jewelry for men .
Beneath the soft face was a body of primitive , raw male muscle , with the idea being that jewelry makes a man even sexier .
The ad copy claimed that jewelry would attract women and make them " willing to accept your rules . "
Wang Hao - wei has asked flashy " pretty boys " how they cope if their girlfriends wo n't listen to them .
Often the case is , " I give her a good slap in the face . "
Despite such anecdotal evidence , however , there are hopes that there will be positives from the new male fashion sense .
Ning Yin - bin assumes that as men and women compete in corporeal beauty , some balance will be reached , without going to extremes .
Lin Ching - yun , who has often expressed in writing her conviction that people should n't go for cosmetic surgery unless they have little choice , says that the advantage of men entering the ranks of cosmetic surgery patients is that there is more supervision of the industry ; women who go for plastic surgery accompanied by husbands or boyfriends usually get better results .
Liu Hsiang , who spends a lot of time dressing and making up , has come to feel deeply the trouble women go through in their pursuit of beauty .
Perhaps , when more men can feel the sentiment that women have known for millennia of " dressing up to please others , " gender relations will be a little more harmonious .
