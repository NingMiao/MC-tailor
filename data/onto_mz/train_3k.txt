Big Managers on Campus
In recent years , advanced education for professionals has become a hot topic in the business community .
With this trend , suddenly the mature faces of managers boasting an average of over ten years of professional experience have flooded in among the young people populating university campuses .
In order to attract this group of seasoned adults pulling in over NT$ 1 million a year back to the ivory tower , universities have begun to establish executive MBA -LRB- EMBA -RRB- programs .
In response , each year over 1000 mature professionals looking to recharge their minds and retool their know - how compete for a precious few openings in executive degree programs at top institutions such as National Taiwan University -LRB- NTU -RRB- and National Chengchi University .
What brings these accomplished business professionals back to the classroom ?
What knowledge do they seek that can not be found in society at large ?
And what effect does their return have on campus ?
Morris Chang , chairman of TSMC and a leading light of Taiwan 's high - tech industry , is the hottest university lecturer around .
Two years ago , National Chiaotung University invited Chang , one of the Taiwan IT sector 's most prominent success stories , to lecture to students in its MBA program for top managers , single - handedly raising awareness of executive MBA -LRB- EMBA -RRB- programs .
This year , Acer Group chairman Stan Shih will be a guest lecturer at the university .
The crush of business professionals fighting for a spot in the MBA program at Taiwan 's most illustrious institution of higher education - National Taiwan University - ensured that the acceptance rate for the executive graduate school was even lower than that for undergraduates taking the national university entrance examinations .
Various indications demonstrate that the " back flow education " promoted by the Ministry of Education has become the hottest investment undertaking among Taiwan 's universities .
Three years ago , in the effort to establish a greater diversity of higher educational avenues , the Ministry of Education -LRB- MOE -RRB- greatly increased the number of MA degrees open to professionals in the workforce , steadily reducing the proportion of regular students to professionals from the previous 9 - to - 1 ratio .
In addition , the MOE allowed universities to determine entrance examination topics , testing dates and times , and fee structures individually to help them find and obtain the best students .
Always in search of revenue sources , universities naturally fell right into line .
Twelve institutions opened programs in 1999 , with the number of executive degree programs growing to 34 as of this year .
And as the supply has grown , professionals looking to recharge their intellectual batteries in disciplines ranging from Chinese , foreign languages , and physics to information technology and management now have a greater selection from which to choose .
Management white - hot
A wide range of programs is available , but popularity varies greatly .
Last year , National Taiwan University of Science and Technology -LRB- NTUST -RRB- opened the doors of five of its graduate schools to professionals in the workforce .
Among them , the Institute of Fiber planned to accept 10 students , but only 20 applied , resulting in a 50 % acceptance rate ; meanwhile , the Institute of Mechanical Engineering had only 30 applicants for 10 spots .
Similarly , nine graduate institutes at NTU , including mechanical engineering , Three Principles of the People , and biology , opened degree programs to professionals last year .
Expecting to accept 167 students , they attracted a mere 330 - combined applicants .
Compared to the lukewarm popularity of other graduate programs , management institutes are white hot .
The NTUST College of Management attracted nearly 500 applicants with over 10 years of work experience for 20 spots in its executive management program beginning in 1999 .
NTU 's College of Management opened its doors to 44 professionals on a trial basis in 1996 , attracting a phenomenal 990 applicants .
When 95 spots were offered the following year , the number of applicants rose again to 1400 .
Currently , around a dozen public and private universities in Taiwan , including NTU , National Chiaotung University , National Sun Yat - sen University , Da - Yeh Institute of Technology , and Yuan - Ze Institute of Technology , offer advanced degree programs for executive management personnel .
What is it that makes graduate programs in management so popular among the working population ?
Liao Ching - jong , director of the NTUST College of Management , relates that new entrants into the professional ranks concentrate on accumulating professional know - how , while seasoned middle - and top - level executives seek an edge in management .
And while most recent university graduates are able to apply professional know - how upon entering the work force , one is not necessarily taught management in the workplace .
Hence universities are the place for systematic instruction on management .
" Given the speed at which the business environment is changing , many new concepts were not previously taught , " says Wu Se - hwa , dean of National Chengchi University 's College of Commerce .
Wu notes that such new fields as venture capital , technology management , intellectual property , and e-commerce are all recent additions to the curriculum over the past few years .
Professor Tang Ming - je of NTU 's College of Management adds : " With small , medium - size and family businesses forming the backbone of Taiwanese industry , one could do just fine without professional management .
But in the age of the global village , many bosses are finding that relying on ' instinct ' to make business decisions is not enough , and that they need systematic management concepts . "
Other management experts note that once Taiwan joins the World Trade Organization -LRB- WTO -RRB- , foreign universities will be able to recruit students directly in Taiwan , and that with the Ministry of Education asking national universities to come up with a portion of their own funding , universities are doubly motivated to establish programs of this sort .
NTU , which enjoys the distinction of being Taiwan 's premier institution of higher education , " never lacks for students , because there are always people who want to attend NTU , " says Tang Ming - je .
More than a diploma
In order to accommodate professionals with day jobs , many universities have scheduled their business management courses during evening hours .
The sight of professionals in suits and ties rushing to class at dusk contrasts greatly from the typical jeans and casual attire of fresh - faced undergrads .
Shuttling between the office and the campus , do they ever feel like they 're burning the candle at both ends ?
At some schools , even professionals boasting Ph.D. degrees are coming back to school for Master 's degrees .
Is the degree really that important to them ?
Mouton Lee , in charge of over 80 employees and production of key components as president of ABBA Linear Tech Co. , Ltd. , is a second - year student in the NTUST Graduate School of Management .
Lee relates that as a youth he studied because he was forced to , but now his motivations for learning are far greater - so great in fact that he registered for three classes at the start of the semester , a decision he has come to regret for lack of time .
Lee , who has also taken short - term management courses , says , " Degree programs are better , since the pressure makes you grow . "
Mouton Lee would like a Master 's degree , yet today he studies for the knowledge it brings .
Ever since graduating with a degree in mechanical engineering from NTUST and setting out to start his own business over 20 years ago , that degree has sat in a drawer somewhere , relegated to mere symbolic significance .
Hsieh Sun - chi , director of the Control Yuan 's Office of Information Management and a 25 - year veteran of civil service , relates that he has already attained the highest rank a general civil servant can achieve , yet at the age of 50 he still has over a decade until retirement .
Two years ago , this led him to consider taking a new direction , and he tested into National Chengchi University 's College of Commerce intent on making connections with movers and shakers in different fields .
Chang Chin - tsung , a researcher at the Chung - Shan Institute of Science & Technology with a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from a US university , shuttles between his office in Taoyuan s Lungtan and the NTU campus three days each week .
Long immersed in the sciences and always focusing on numbers and statistics , Chang says he feels like he " has gotten into a mental rut . "
Although Hsinchu 's National Chiaotung University offers a similar management curriculum , he was concerned that the students there would be science park types with similar backgrounds in high tech fields .
Thus he would rather spend the extra time commuting to NTU to be around students with experience in such fields as advertising , finance , and architecture .
" I 'd be lying if I said the degree does n't matter .
If it did n't , why not just get into a non-degree program ?
The truth is that a degree in management does nothing to help me in my current job , but it gives me a second skill if I choose another route in the future . "
Advanced training for professionals has become a hot topic among executives over the past two years , but continuing education is nothing new among Taiwan 's universities .
For instance , National Chengchi University 's Public Administration Center has offered graduate extension courses for executives for over a decade , the difference being that , upon completion of the curriculum students only receive a certificate of course credit .
In comparison , a Master 's degree is far more appealing , given that a degree is awarded upon completion of studies .
Burning the proverbial candle
Motivated by the degree or not , the enthusiasm of these professionals for their studies is impressive .
Nevertheless , they must pay a hefty price to be able to study in the first place .
First , working during the day and attending classes at night is often a war of energy and will .
Next , they must shuffle their work schedules to accommodate their studies .
Many of them have to reschedule business trips .
Meanwhile , some become highway speeders , rushing from Taoyuan or Hsinchu to attend class .
And female managers , ordinarily responsible for household chores as well , really burn the proverbial candle at both ends .
" I have my time perfectly allotted , " says Morna Lee , Taiwan regional business manager for Kellogg 's .
She divides her schedule into three - month cycles , and with one class on Thursday afternoons , her company does its best to accommodate her by not holding meetings that involve her on that day of the week .
Still , sometimes nothing can be done , such as the time that she had a meeting in Hong Kong early one Friday morning , forcing her to miss class on Thursday while she flew to Hong Kong .
She had to fly quickly back to Taipei to make class on Saturday afternoon .
Despite often staying up until 2:00 or 3:00 AM to study or write reports , Lee likes mingling in the executive management class with a diverse group of students from different fields , and feels that the new ideas the professors feed them help keep her brain supple .
Moreover , she muses , " We managers are a strange breed .
If we do n't exhaust ourselves , we end up sick . "
Female professionals like Morna Lee represent a minority among executive degree students , accounting for just about five percent .
" If you asked me whether work or family is more important , I would say that since entering society 20 years ago work has always come first , " states Donna Sun , vice president of the Human Resource Division at Schmidt Scientific Taiwan .
Even if she has no classes to attend , leaving the office at 8:00 PM is no different from the perspective of her family life than the extra hour she spends attending classes until 9:00 PM .
She is thankful that her son , a university student , and her daughter , a third - year junior high school student , have always been very independent and self - reliant .
Hiring someone to help with housework , Lee is a model for the children when it comes to studying , even taking them to the library on breaks to conduct research .
No magic bullet
Compared to young students focused on getting a degree , the motivations of professionals studying for advanced degrees " are not that simple . "
They might be after new knowledge , keen to sport a fancy degree from a graduate school like NTU or Chengchi University , out to network with others , or looking out for the survival of business and to raise competitiveness by searching for answers to difficult work or business issues .
" Looking for quick answers from professors is a misguided concept , " says Tang Ming - je , professor of strategic management at NTU 's Department of International Business .
Before commencing a course , Tang tells his students , " I am not in the consulting business .
There are no magic bullets , for if I had any I 'd have gotten rich long ago . "
Wu Se - hwa , dean of National Chengchi University 's College of Commerce , relates , " Academic institutions provide systematic thinking , not the answers to specific questions . "
Wu tells his students that if they put other things aside and concentrate on their studies for three weeks , maybe they 'll find the answer themselves .
Wu notes that adult students bring rich practical experience to the table , and lack only the knowledge to combine and integrate scattered experience .
For them , returning to school is valuable for establishing their own modes of thinking with the knowledge they pick up .
Unlike the 20th century , where the amount of capital was the greatest factor determining success , Wu Se - hwa believes that the next century will be about " knowledge as the main competitive force . "
The book The 500 - year Delta notes that in the 1960s each executive might only have to learn one new skill each year , such as how to use a computer or send e-mail .
By the 1990s , accumulation of know - how accelerated many times over , so that executives needed to learn something new each day .
Now , in the 21st century , each manager might have to learn something new every single hour of the working day .
Curriculums need selling points
In order to satisfy students with diverse expectations and needs for basic knowledge , what innovative means must a professor resort to ?
And what challenges does this pose for the institution itself ?
People are going to fall asleep no matter what , so you have to think on your feet and use different techniques to stimulate their attention , " remarks Mark Gia - khy Tang , professor in the Department of Risk Management and Insurance at National Chengchi University .
Students who have been away from the classroom for well over a decade can not be expected to remember all the formulas they learned in statistics and economics classes way back when .
Nor should classes turn into solo performances by the professor .
Professor Tang 's approach is to lecture on theory for the first hour , then use the remaining time on the homework that each group worked on since the previous week .
Tang 's own " Three No's " policy guides his teaching approach : No midterms , no final exams , and no calling on students .
Instead , grades are based on homework results and class participation .
Tang 's risk management class is discussing how to identify risks .
One of the questions is : " If there were a fairy who could spell out for you exactly what you would experience for the rest of your life , consider what advantages and disadvantages the following information might have for you .
For instance , no matter how hard you work , you are still fated to be poor all your life .
Or what if you were fated to have everything go your way ?
What if , for example , you 're going to be elected to the legislature , or become the president ? "
Tom Lin , associate professor of marketing at NTUST , describes the main difference between teaching adult executives and regular students :
" Executives are always asking questions .
Even when they have an idea themselves , they 'll still bring up issues they encountered in their jobs to see how you respond . "
Often , says Lin , such questions leave him stumped .
Another issue for adult students always on the run is their unfamiliarity with the campus .
In order to enhance their sense of identification with the school , NTUST designed an overseas business camp program .
Last year , one professor made a big hit with over 30 students , taking them to mainland China for over ten days to familiarize them with the investment environment there .
This year , trips are planned to Japan and Silicon Valley in the United States .
Planting in fertile soil
Judging from the manner in which universities are opening their doors for continuing education , non-degree programs , and professional training , higher education in Taiwan appears to be undergoing a sort of makeover .
With these changes , universities must not only take care of teaching and research , but must also make sure they play their third function properly - spreading knowledge and sharing it with the public .
Still , detractors point out that university graduate programs for business executives appear to be elitist .
One student attending a non-degree program at NTUST relates that there are not enough spots to go around in the executive degree programs .
Hoping to make the switch from the non-degree program , he failed to pass the screening that is administered prior to the admissions test .
" If you fail a test , you only have yourself to blame , but tripping up on the initial screening is just a matter of not having a high enough job title . "
Each year when EMBA program acceptances are released , newspapers carry letters from readers relating how certain national university graduate schools compete to accept CEOs and presidents of listed corporations , or the children of rich business people .
The NTUST student expresses cynicism toward the application and review process , suspecting that " they just pay attention to company name and job title . "
Moreover , continuing education courses charge hefty tuition fees .
For instance , NTU divides the school year into three semesters , at NT$ 50,000 per semester , while other institutions charge between NT$ 3700 and $ 10,000 per credit , a full two to three times more than regular graduate student tuition .
Such instances naturally lead to suspicion that graduate schools such as these are " out to make a killing " by catering only to an elite few .
" From review , to written test , to oral exam , in order to ensure fairness , no professor is involved in more than one portion of the process , " says Huang Chung - hsing , director of the EMBA program at NTU .
Still , Huang admits that the bigger the company and higher the candidate 's job title , the greater their chances of acceptance into the program .
This can be partially attributed to the belief among professors that the commitment of their educational resources yields " more bang for the buck . "
As Tang Ming - je forthrightly explains , university professors ' time is a national resource , and if they can have a positive impact on an executive controlling budgets of billions of NT dollars , their contribution to country and society is considerable .
Asks Liao Ching - jong , director of the NTUST Graduate School of Management , concurs , " Which is greater , the marginal benefit of a company president or a staff member 's education ?
The president can go back and put what she learns into practice right away . "
What is more , even if schools do not deliberately seek out company presidents , they invariably perform better on oral exams - perhaps due to their greater experience .
" We must ask ourselves some questions , too , when EMBAs are thought of as giving away degrees to the privileged few , " comments Wu Se - Hwa .
Wu tells his professors that unless they perform well in class , the EMBA can not develop further , as universities are founded upon academic research .
As for tuition policies , Wu Se - Hwa relates that with an annual budget of NT$ 2.1 billion , National Chengchi University spends about NT$ 200,000 per student .
Thus , when it comes down to calculating costs , NT$ 10,000 per credit is actually quite cheap .
Industry retooling
The EMBA craze reflects the cold , intense competition of social Darwinism , but does it also signify that Taiwanese industry is beginning to devote greater attention to the training of top executives ?
Many scholars believe that with the EMBA phenomenon just getting off its feet in Taiwan , many corporate bosses are taking a " wait - and - see " attitude .
This is reflected in the way students approach the programs , not informing their bosses that they have applied to a program until they have been accepted , and not occupying work time if school takes place in the evening .
This way , their boss 's attitude has no particular bearing on what they do .
Perhaps business education may not be widespread in Taiwan at this time , yet a small number of company bosses have taken the lead themselves - taking advanced courses and setting an example for management personnel .
Ma Yu - shan , chairman of Kingdom Construction and 64 years old this year , tested into NTU 's College of Management in 1998 , becoming NTU 's oldest student .
For Ma , " living and learning " is more than just a maxim , as each year Kingdom Construction employees are required to undergo 80 hours of on - the - job training .
" For the boss to lead his team , he ca n't just tell his subordinates to learn , while he remains static himself .
Not to mention that in discussions with employees , if they know you 're the kind of boss who does n't seek to further himself , they put less stock in what you say , " notes Ma .
With the rapid changes in the business environment , poor decision - making can have serious consequences for company development .
" The pressure on the boss is tremendous , because nobody comes to the CEO with easy questions . "
Too busy to attend regular courses , Ma Yu - shan took the advice of an NTU professor and hired a Ph.D. student to tutor him one semester in " management economics . "
Amber Huang , president of Changhua 's Feng Huei Steel & Iron Company , is a student in the Department of Business Administration at NTUST .
Huang notes three advantages of the boss going to school .
First , it 's good for his company 's image .
As his company must frequently seek bank loans , Huang asks rhetorically , " Could a studious boss be a bad guy ? "
This image has helped him secure loans with little difficulty every time .
Second , it sets a good example for employees .
Lastly , speaking the professional lingo fluently helps enhance his authority .
Knowledge for the new century
In the effort to cultivate management talent , many prominent multinational corporations have founded their own teaching institutions , Toyota University and Intel University being two good examples .
In Taiwan , the Acer Group 's Aspire Academy opened its doors in Lungtan -LRB- Taoyuan Country -RRB- last October after three years of planning .
During the Aspire Academy opening ceremony , academy president Stan Shih , chairman of the Acer Group , remarked that he hopes to introduce management models from Europe and America and mesh them with the unique attributes of Taiwanese industry to enhance the globalization of Asian business .
Shih noted that through the sharing of experiences , emerging businesses might save themselves a lot of groping in the dark .
Are people at the fin de siecle inspired to learn by the confluence of technology , humanities , and economic knowledge ?
At least the entrepreneurs , managers , and executives in campuses around Taiwan clearly recognize that learning is a necessity for survival and an engine of growth .
Everyday People and A Story of True Grit --
The Wu Family of Taihsi
-LRB- Laura Li / photos by Hsueh Chi - kuang / tr. by David Mayer -RRB-
They say a rising tide lifts all boats .
No one would know more about that than the older generation in Taiwan .
The changes of the past five decades have had a deep impact , for example , on the Wu family of Yunlin County .
Their main claim to fame is ... nothing , actually , and that is precisely why their story typifies the experiences of so many .
So lend your attention , dear reader , as we recount the ups and downs of an average family from a quiet little backwater called Taihsi Township .
Wu Tsung - sheng and his older sister have come to meet me at the train station in Touliu , administrative seat of Yunlin County .
We pile into a car and head toward their parents ' home .
Wu Tsung - sheng fills me in on his hometown .
" Taihsi is a rather unusual place , " says Tsung - sheng , the family 's oldest grandson and a doctoral candidate in sociology at Tunghai University in Taichung .
" When I read the studies that describe Taiwan as being so prosperous , I have to wonder how their descriptions could be so totally different from what our lives have been .
They might as well be talking about a different planet . "
Probably most people do n't realize , adds Tsung - sheng , that there are still places in Taiwan as backward as Taihsi .
To the outsider , however , the place does n't look backward at all .
As Tsung - sheng drives west in a very nice Toyota at a comfortable speed down a broad county highway , his older sister sits in the front passenger seat with cell phone in hand discussing the traffic situation with someone at home .
In the meantime , Tsung - sheng 's five - year - old nephew clamors from the back seat for his mother to buy him a Pokemon plaything , just like kids the world over are doing these days .
When McDonald 's stores in Taiwan were swamped last year during a giveaway of Hello Kitty dolls , lots of people thought they might be able to beat the crowds by hitting McDonald 's in supposedly untrendy Taihsi , but they found the lines there every bit as long as in more urban locations .
The emperor is far away
The scenery grows increasingly rural as we move west through the townships of Huwei , Tuku , Paochung , and Tungshih .
Temples tower over green rice fields .
Less than half an hour after leaving the train station we get off the county highway and onto narrow Tungshih East Road .
When we reach our destination in rural Taihsi Township , a few dozen buildings of modern ferroconcrete construction line the road , and shops of every description occupy the ground floor of each one .
Wu Tsung - sheng 's parents , who are pushing 60 years old , run a local bakery , and they greet us with the wide smiles and warm hospitality so typical of haikou -LRB- as the locals are accustomed to calling Taihsi and the surrounding townships near the coast in western Yunlin County -RRB- .
They also speak Taiwanese with an unmistakable haikou accent .
To welcome their guest they have ordered a big seafood meal in advance .
Tsung - sheng 's grandmother , parents , uncles , aunts , cousins , nephews , and nieces have all come in from around haikou for the gathering .
The strength of the Wu clan 's family ties is plainly evident .
These people go back for generations here .
From the destruction of World War II to the mixed joy and grief of the early post-war years , from the barest of rural hamlets to a prosperous little town , this family has seen it all .
84 - year - old grandma Wu is not as sharp as she used to be , but she can still rattle off a tale or two .
Two indignities suffered back in the 1940s , in particular , remain indelibly etched in her memory .
The first occurred in the latter part of World War II when the Japanese tied her hands behind her back and marched her off to do forced labor for over a year , building roads , digging ditches , and carrying a shoulder pole .
The second indignity was the onerous taxes that were levied in the early years after Taiwan returned to Chinese rule .
" We had to pay taxes twice a year , " says grandma Wu , flashing a mouthful of dental work .
" The first time was for water , and the second was for land .
It did n't matter whether you even had a crop to harvest or not - you had to pay , or they 'd throw you in jail . "
She explains that one dou -LRB- 10 liters -RRB- of rice back in the 1940s was worth five or six yuan , or about four days ' pay for a manual laborer , but the tax on one jia of land -LRB- 0.97 hectares -RRB- was 150 yuan .
A lot of people had to borrow money just to pay their taxes .
" It took four days to earn one dou of rice , " says grandma Wu .
" We could n't afford to eat it , because we needed it to pay our taxes . "
Although the Kuomintang government eventually carried out land reform to provide relief for poor farmers , the Wu family never shared in the benefits .
They were as poor as their neighbors , to be sure , but they owned land and were thus classified as small landowners , which by definition meant that they neither had any extra land to rent out nor did they rent from others .
While many of their neighbors received land as a result of the reforms , the Wu family got nothing .
Grandma Wu was close to 30 years old when the Kuomintang recovered Taiwan from Japan , but the event meant little to her , for she had never received any schooling .
All she remembers is that when the war ended , Taiwan was turned over to " them . "
With a grin , grandma Wu throws up her hands in a gesture of helplessness and quips , " When the colonial government spoke , I did n't understand their Japanese .
When the Kuomintang speaks , I do n't understand their Mandarin either . "
" There 's no difference between the Japanese government and the Kuomintang , " says Grandma Wu .
" If something important comes up , they send a local official out to make an announcement and explain what it 's all about . "
Wu Tsung - sheng adds , " They 're totally outside the loop here .
You of course know the phrase , ' Heaven is high and the emperor is far away . '
Well , it was people like my grandmother who coined it . "
Grandma Wu was adopted into the Wu family at age ten .
Within half a year both of her adoptive parents died , and at age 11 she slipped and fell in the sugar cane fields , poking her left eye out .
Orphaned and blind in one eye , a hard life lay in store for her , but she made the best of a bad situation .
With no male siblings to carry on the family line , at age 25 she managed to find a husband who was willing to let his first male child take the Wu surname .
The children came rapidly , and there was never any money to spare .
But it is clear that she does live reasonably well now .
When did survival cease to be such a struggle ?
Grandma Wu remembers quite clearly when the turning point came .
It was in the early 1980s , when her oldest grandchild was already a teenager , that business gradually started going better for her three sons .
The three brothers got together and decided that they should each give her NT$ 2,000 every month .
For the first time in her life , she was able to relax a bit , then five years ago the government started providing a monthly pension of NT$ 3,000 .
This was enough to cover meals , and her life improved even more .
Grandma Wu now lives together with several other old folks very near the coast in the old traditional farmhouse where she grew up .
Her main worry these days is her granddaughter in Taipei , who is in her 30s and still unmarried .
" Her father got married when he was 22 .
How can a girl be putting things off ? "
13 - year - old construction worker
A lot of hard work has gone into the comfortable life Grandma Wu enjoys today .
Her eldest son Wu Chien - lo recounts that after he graduated from sixth grade in 1954 his family was too poor to let him go any further in school , so at age 13 he took off with an older boy on the slow train for Taipei .
Without pausing to take in the sights of the big city , Chien - lo went straight to work at a construction site , where he carried a shoulder pole and mixed cement .
Buildings were going up everywhere in Taipei in the mid-1950s , and the city was bursting with opportunities .
But , says Chien - lo , " I only had a grade - school education .
I did n't have what it took to think about a career in Taipei .
I just wanted to go back and help my family work the fields . "
After two years in Taipei he went back home just as the area was getting electric power for the first time .
The bright lights at night got some people so excited at first that they could n't get to sleep .
Taiwan back then was one of the world s biggest producers of sugar cane , but the harvest was extremely difficult work , as Chien - lo is painfully aware .
Once he came very close to cutting a finger clean off with a sickle , but he just slapped some cement mix -LRB- commonly regarded as a good disinfectant -RRB- on the wound and worked on through the pain .
United we stand
Wu Chien - lo joined the army at age 20 , and during his stint he made friends with someone who had been making a living as a baker .
Chien - lo began to realize that selling his manual labor was not a viable long - term option .
He decided to open a bakery .
After receiving his discharge he borrowed NT$ 12,000 from his father , hired a baker , and opened up a store .
He himself rode around on a motorcycle all day selling beverages and baked goods .
His capital ran out before he expected , and he had to ask for a second loan from his father - in - law to get his business off the ground .
A few years later his younger brother Tsai Jui - ting -LRB- as the second son , he was given his father 's surname -RRB- got married and followed in Wu Chien - lo 's footsteps by selling baked goods and beverages .
To avoid competing with his brother , Jui - ting opened up his store over ten kilometers north in Mailiao Township .
Jui - ting , who in his youth always wore hand - me - downs and crude garments fashioned from throwaway rice sacks and the like , never put on his own set of store - bought clothes until just prior to joining the army .
Who would have guessed he would one day become the biggest beverage wholesaler in the Mailiao area ?
Having watched his older brothers succeed with their bakery businesses , the youngest brother Tsai Kuo - lung took up the same business in the neighboring township of Szuhu after finishing his military service .
The three brothers have worked together over the years to build up their businesses , and an efficient division of labor has evolved among them .
Kuo - lung today is in charge of doing all the baking , and he acts as supplier for Wu Chien - lo and Tsai Jui - ting .
" In a rural area like this , " says Wu Chien - lo , " family members work together , and everybody shares equally in the success . "
Not surprisingly , of course , he has seen quarrels arise in other families over who does the most work and who goofs off , who 's getting rich and who 's not , but in the Wu family , at least , harmony has been the key to success .
All three brothers are hard - working and frugal .
Each one married through a matchmaker , and none of them ever had an album of wedding photos made .
Asks Tsai Kuo - lung , " Why should we work so hard and pinch pennies all the time just to spend our money on something like that ? "
All three brothers drive Toyota Camrys , purchased from the same dealer .
One can gradually save up money by running a small business , to be sure , but Wu Chien - lo states frankly , " Land is where the real money is .
It 's hard to get by just running a business . "
Because his beverage wholesaling business requires a lot of space for large warehouses , he borrowed money from friends for many years to buy land .
Little did he know when he first started that what he bought 30 years ago would go up in price from NT$ 3,000 per ping -LRB- approximately 3.3 square meters -RRB- to over NT$ 100,000 today .
When you throw in the family farmland , which has not yet been divided among the brothers , the Wu clan is worth over NT$ 100 million .
Says Wu Chien - lo , " Who figured prices would go up like they have ?
We did n't buy the land as an investment .
We 're not greedy enough to even think in those terms .
We just bought it because we needed it for our business . "
Sacrificing for the kids
Although they may be loath to spend frivolously on themselves , Wu Chien - lo and his wife consider money no object when it comes to their children 's education .
" The reason we worked so hard around the clock for so many years was because we were afraid that we might not be able to do right by our kids .
We were worried that they might fall in with the wrong crowd after they got into junior high , " says Mrs. Wu , adding that Taihsi is well known for the fact that it has " lots of dust in the air , lots of yams , and lots of gangsters . "
To keep their kids out of trouble they sent all four of them off to a well - known Catholic boarding school in Touliu as soon as they reached junior high .
Each child spent six years there -LRB- except for the second daughter , who only attended for three years -RRB- , and every weekend the two parents would pack up lots of goodies and take the bus to see their kids .
It was a difficult trip , and required several transfers .
The total cost of one year 's tuition plus room and board at the private school came to more than NT$ 150,000 per child .
With four kids at the school , the financial burden was substantial , especially considering the fact that they were spending these sums back in the mid-1980s .
The struggle to pay tuition took every ounce of energy they had .
" That 's the responsibility you bear as a parent .
You want to see your children succeed , " says Wu Chien - lo .
Luckily , all four of his children were good students and had no problem passing their university entrance examinations .
In their little hometown , Wu Tsung - sheng and his siblings are noted for their excellent academic achievements .
The result has been a bit comical in at least one respect , for the eldest daughter was so strictly observant of the prohibition against speaking Taiwanese in school -LRB- a rule formerly enforced throughout Taiwan -RRB- that she does n't even speak Taiwanese very well any more .
After graduating from National Taiwan Normal University in Taipei , she came back to Yunlin County several years ago to teach senior high school in Touliu , and now she makes people laugh every time she opens her mouth to speak her odd brand of Taiwanese .
It makes for an amusing contrast with her grandmother , who does n't speak Mandarin well at all .
In the view of Wu Tsung - sheng , the heavy emphasis that rural parents put on education does n't have so much to do with the idea of getting ahead , but stems mainly from a deep respect for learning .
His parents are not interested in his specialty , nor do they know anything about it , but they have never objected to his chosen path , nor did they say a word when his younger brother switched his major from business management to sociology .
This long leash is all the more impressive in view of the fact that there is no chance that either of these sociology majors will ever be able to make a living near home -LRB- because there are no major universities or research institutions in Yunlin County -RRB- .
" Thinking back on it , I realize that our parents began encouraging us very early to aim high and not feel like we had to stay near home .
We all started boarding school at age twelve and then went on to university in Taipei .
As we got older , we went back home less and less . "
Their studies ended up weakening their ties to their hometown , notes Tsung - sheng wistfully .
Their parents , in the meantime , are doing everything they can to make it easier for the children to come back home if necessary .
For starters , they 've built a multi-story house with a separate floor set aside for each of the children .
Chien - lo explains , " Our two boys have n't started working or gotten married yet .
I hope they 'll be able to make a go of it off in some city , but if it does n't work out they can always come back and tend the store . "
It would probably make better business sense , in fact , to close the store .
People have been moving away from the haikou area for many years , and the local economy is in the doldrums .
What 's more , it will only get more and more difficult to make money running an old - fashioned mom and pop store now that a new convenience store has opened up across the street .
Even so , the couple is n't yet ready to call it quits .
It is for their children 's sake that they stay in business .
Living next to heavy industry
Less than ten kilometers away in Mailiao stands the Formosa Plastic Group 's sixth naphtha cracker complex .
Tsai Jui - ting points out that even though Formosa Plastics uses a lot of foreign laborers from southeast Asia , the complex has also hired a lot of local people , and since the plant went into operation he does n't seem to see so many young people hanging out in the area 's small towns with nothing to do .
Even though the seawall built to protect the plant has blocked people 's view of the sea , and in spite of worries about the possibility of mercury pollution in the soil , the extra employment has won the plant a lot of local support .
Says Wu Chien - lo , " I always say , if you 've got work , you 've got food on the table .
Do n't go around complaining about the pay being too low .
It used to take four days to earn one dou of rice .
Now you can earn over ten dou in just one day .
If that 's not enough for you , then you might as well go starve to death . "
Wu Chien - lo and his younger brothers do n't expect a lot from the government .
At most , they express nostalgia for the days when former general Hau Pei - tsun served as premier , because " they arrested a lot of criminals when he was in charge . "
The one thing that really irks them now is national health insurance .
" When you run your own business like we do , " says youngest brother Tsai Kuo - lung , " a family of five like ours has to pay over NT$ 60,000 per year in premiums for national health insurance .
That 's a lot more expensive than labor insurance or farmer 's insurance .
What 's more , he adds , there are no major hospitals in Yunlin County , so if you get sick you 've got to go all the way to the next county .
Not only that , says Tsai , the deductible for medicine was jacked up " ridiculously high " last year , and everyone is complaining bitterly about it .
Hoping for more democracy
When the subject turns to politics and Taiwan independence , the normally outspoken Wu Chien - lo suddenly grows cautious .
" It does n't matter who wins the election .
They 're all good candidates .
We 'll just have to wait and see . "
Wu Tsung - sheng understands the reasons for his father 's reticence quite well .
Yunlin County politics are riddled with factionalism and the influence of organized crime , and you can find ample proof here that all politics are indeed local .
With over 40 voters in the extended family , the Wu clan is a plum of a voting block .
All the local factions eagerly woo Chien - lo , who has in the past gotten deeply involved in politics and taken to the streets in support of certain candidates .
Over the years , however , he has learned that it is best to avoid offending people , and he now plays his cards close to the vest .
Wu Tsung - sheng explains that local politics in the haikou area are linked only tenuously to what goes on in distant Taipei , and the concept of democracy has n't made much headway here .
The locals are most concerned about what public figure " gives people face " by showing up at weddings and funerals , and who has close personal ties with whom .
What is more , vote buying is accepted with breezy indifference , as if it were the normal thing to do .
However , says Tsung - sheng , local politics probably wo n't be so dirty once the younger generation becomes more influential .
Fifty years of struggle have brought prosperity to our island .
Will it take another fifty years to establish a mature democracy ?
As Tsung - sheng drives down the road , holding forth on politics and society , I ca n't help feeling all of a sudden that there is every reason to be very confident about the future of Taiwan .

Taiwan Toils with Double Trouble -- Forest Fires Burn and Oil Spill Bubbles
-LRB- Chang Chin - ju / tr. by David Mayer -RRB-
With the ruling and opposition parties slugging it out over the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant , a cargo ship ran quietly aground in mid-January just offshore from the Lungkeng Ecological Protection Area in Kenting National Park .
Preliminary containment of the resulting oil spill was not achieved until late February .
In the meantime , Taiwan has been hit by a rash of forest fires .
Clearly , the activities of man are becoming increasingly destructive of nature .
Can we expect to go on forever wreaking havoc on the earth without inviting a backlash from Mother Nature ?
The armed forces dispatched thousands of soldiers to deal with the oil spill at Lungkeng , located at the southern tip of Taiwan , and the first phase of the cleanup was completed on February 16 with the removal of over 300 tons of oil from the shore .
The second phase entails cleaning the uplifted coral seashore and restoring the environment of the intertidal zone .
The problem is that efforts to clean up the oil could cause great damage to the complex ecology of the coral shoreline and destroy the beauty of the intertidal zone .
How to go about undoing the environmental destruction that has already occurred ?
Due to a lack of comprehensive studies , the local environment in Lungkeng is not sufficiently understood .
With scholars still in the midst of research , it has been impossible to take concrete action .
The oil spill occurred at about 5 p.m. on January 14 when the Greek freighter MV Amorgos carrying ore from India to the port of Nantong in mainland China ran aground about a kilometer off the cape at Oluanpi .
A thousand tons of fuel oil began pouring through the ship 's torn hull .
The disaster has hit the uplifted coral at Lungkeng the hardest .
The ocean waves brought the oil to shore , making a mess of the beautiful coral coastline , slathering shellfish and aquatic plants , and filling the air with a petroleum stench .
Taiwanese society , caught up in the furor over the nuclear power plant up north , took little immediate notice of the accident .
The shipowner did n't stop up the leaking hull of the MV Amorgos until the end of January .
He went through a shipping agent in Taiwan to hire local residents in Lungkeng to clean up the shoreline , but the oil slick had mucked up a three - kilometer stretch of strikingly beautiful blue waters , throwing a pall over the local tourism and fishing industries .
After days of bitter complaints , aggrieved residents finally got the attention of the news media .
On February 7 , three weeks after the spill , the Environmental Protection Administration formed an emergency task force , and EPA chief Edgar Lin headed south to inspect the site .
On February 10 , Premier Chang Chun - hsiung and several other high - ranking government officials boarded a military helicopter for an aerial survey of the spill , and the premier instructed the Ministry of Transportation and Communications and the Ministry of National Defense to get the oil cleaned up within 30 working days .
The EPA worked up an estimate of the cost of cleanup , ship removal , and reparations to fishermen , and notified both the shipowner and the insurance company .
The ship 's captain and other ship officers had to post bond before they were allowed to leave Taiwan .
In addition to these emergency measures , the EPA has also been working to draft : -LRB- 1 -RRB- a set of guidelines for establishing task forces to deal with major maritime environmental disasters ; and -LRB- 2 -RRB- an emergency response plan for maritime oil spills .
Draft versions of both these documents will be presented to the cabinet as soon as possible .
The cabinet will request the Legislative Yuan to authorize an extraordinary budget allocation to cover the purchase of oil containment booms , sorbents , helicopters , and other equipment needed for responding to oil spills .
The problem , however , is that authorities did not respond in the critical first few hours and days following the spill .
This failure focused renewed attention on poor coordination between the central and local governments .
In a public opinion poll , nearly 70 % of respondents indicated dissatisfaction with the government 's handling of the oil spill .
With today 's huge volume of international shipping , oil spills are becoming a serious problem .
Although the recent spill in Taiwan was small in comparison with 10,000 - ton spills that have occurred elsewhere , the situation here is worrisome because , as a petroleum importer , oil tankers ply the waters around our island in swarms .
There is no telling when the next spill might happen .
While acknowledging the necessity of drafting emergency response plans , academics argue that an even more pressing task facing the government is to catalog Taiwan 's marine resources .
Otherwise , they say , it may be impossible to press reparation claims against shipping companies that accurately reflect the extent of damages .
The lack of a detailed understanding of the Lungkeng ecology presents a perfect case in point .
Similarly , after the recent spate of forest fires in central and southern Taiwan , scholars have again reacted by calling on the government to begin as soon as possible with ongoing studies of Taiwan 's forest habitats .
Investigations have shown that most of the recent forest fires plaguing Taiwan have been caused by campfires .
Although the recent fires have been put out fairly quickly , a blaze on Snow Mountain caused alarm when it burned near a stand of rare Chinese hemlock as well as streams that are home to the Formosan landlocked salmon , which is regarded as a national treasure .
Forestry service officials indicate that none of the recent blazes has caused major damage , but the Council of Agriculture has instructed the various forestry districts to step up patrols to keep man - made forest fires from happening again and again .
Chao Jung - tai , a researcher at Taiwan Forestry Research Institute , feels that the public ought to take the forest fires and the oil spill in Lungkeng as warnings of the urgent need to understand the environment in which we live .
For example , Chao asks : What are the scientific criteria for deciding when a forest fire has caused enough damage to require rehabilitation of the environment afterwards ?
Under what circumstances is it okay to let the environment recover on its own ?
These questions require ongoing monitoring and research before objective criteria can be developed and environmental rehabilitation efforts can be carried out properly .
Once an environment that has taken shape over millions of years is destroyed , it is usually beyond man 's ability to undo the damage .
Efforts to that end often prove fruitless .
It is time to start devoting serious thought to the question of how to preserve the beauty of the island we call home .

Superstore Consumer Culture
-LRB- Teng Sue - feng / photos by Jimmy Lin / tr. by Jonathan Barnard -RRB-
Yet another superstore chain has come to Taiwan .
On December 9 , the British firm Tesco said hello to consumers in Taiwan when it formally opened its clean , bright and spacious store .
There are now about 100 retailers in Taiwan with individual stores of at least several thousand ping -LRB- a ping equals 36 square feet -RRB- .
With the full adoption of two - day weekends every other week , people in Taiwan have had to figure out what to do with these new days off .
Visiting superstores - with their ample parking , restaurants and piles of consumer goods - has become a major leisure - time activity .
What kind of social changes does Taiwan 's consumer behavior reflect ?
Is densely populated Taiwan well suited to absorb all these stores , which are sprouting up like mushrooms after a rain ?
Waves of traffic are heading out from Taipei toward the suburbs , toward the open expanses in the riverbed area of Neihu .
Once the cars pass the Minchuan or the Second Macarthur Bridge , the landscape becomes dotted with the large signs of major retailers .
These include Costco , the third largest superstore retailer in the United States ; B&Q , the largest do - it - yourself hardware chain in Britain ; and Taiwan 's own RT - Mart .
Shopping at these large stores has quickly become a part of leisure - time life in Taiwan .
A Mrs. Chao , who lives in Neihu , explains that on weekends or vacation days the whole family sleeps late .
Once they are up , if there 's nothing special on the agenda , they go to B&Q to look at stuff for the home .
Then when they get tired , they go to Costco for some Pizza or muffins .
Finally , they end up in RT - Mart , where they buy groceries .
The whole trip takes about half the day .
She had thought that these stores were only crowded on the weekends , but on a rainy weekday in November she decided she did n't feel like cooking and went to buy some prepared foods at the RT - Mart 's deli department .
She discovered that there was n't a single open parking space among the hundreds on the first and second floors of the parking structure .
She was quite surprised to find that business was so good on a weekday .
" Shopping at one of these superstores is a lot like shopping at a department store , " says a Mr. Ko , who works as an engineer for a chemical company in Kaohsiung .
" You go when you 're bored . "
Ko has discovered that as more and more of these stores have opened in Kaohsiung , he and his wife go to department stores less , because in department stores you can only buy clothes , but in superstores you can buy daily necessities , hardware and so forth , and the selection is better .
Shocking the world
The performance of these large retailers in Taiwan has been startling , and superstore chains from Holland , France , the United States and Britain have been arriving on these shores one after another .
A hundred - some foreign stores do NT$ 110 billion in business a year .
According to the Ministry of Finance 's Office of Statistics , business in the first quarter of 2000 for these stores was up 19.54 % over the same quarter the previous year , a higher rate of growth than for convenience stores , supermarkets or department stores .
Since the Dutch firm Makro opened its first Taiwan store in Taoyuan in 1989 , superstores have enjoyed tremendous growth .
The French retailer Carrefour followed Makro 's lead , opening a store in 1989 .
Costco from the United States began planning its first Taiwan store in 1995 , and the French wholesale outlet Casino arrived in 1999 .
A year earlier , the Ruentex group , which owns RT - Mart , bought out two Taiwanese competitors and increased its number of stores to 16 .
That same year , 1998 , Tesco from Britain began to look for sites .
After nearly three years of preparation , in December 2000 they finally opened their first Taiwan store in Taoyuan .
No one had expected that European superstores would be the first to establish a foothold in Taiwan , which had long taken its cues from the American market .
Allen Tien , the head of Carrefour 's public affairs division in Taiwan , relates that Wal
In the Groove , or in a Rut ?
- Life in Middle Age
-LRB- Laura Li / photos by Hsueh Chi - kuang / tr. by Robert Taylor -RRB-
Middle age is the most awkward time .
It 's the age when you ca n't get to sleep till dawn .
The age of sighs but not passion .
The age of sorrow but not anger .
In middle age , you kiss girls on the forehead , not the lips .
It 's the age when you drink strong coffee and take stomach pills .
The age when the phrase " you ca n't escape convention " says it all .
Middle age is afternoon tea .
-LRB- From " Middle Age Is Afternoon Tea , " by Tung Chiao -RRB-
" Middle age is the afternoon , but I ca n't say I have much time to drink tea ! "
Sitting in the silence of his research office , Professor Li Liang - che of the psychology department at National Chengchi University appears pensive .
Indeed , passing 40 is like passing noon .
You miss the fresh , pure , carefree feeling of morning , and the arrogance of noon , yet also yearn for the serene splendor of the sunset .
It is only now , in the afternoon , that worries crowd in , and try as you might you can not raise your flagging spirits .
Worries , ennui - is this a case of that fashionable disease of civilization , the " midlife crisis " ?
" If you 're going to have a crisis , it 's most likely to happen during the " midlife transition , " from 40 to 45 , " says Li .
In people of a melancholy and sensitive disposition , or who have faced many setbacks early in life , it may even set in around the age of 35 .
" In the US , 35 is the maximum age for being in a fraternity , " jokes National Taiwan Normal University audiovisual center director Chao Ning , who is known as a " wunderkind " in the broadcasting world .
After that , your moods begin to seesaw between those of " youth " and " middle age . "
You are perfectly sure that you are in as good form as ever , and have not even reached your peak yet , but looking at all those talented youngsters around you , they seem even more outstanding than yourself , and more like tomorrow 's rising stars .
A vexing feeling of being pushed along by the years gradually builds up , until one day you find yourself high and dry on the shoals of life .
Middle age creeps up on you
" The new waves on the Yangtze River push the old waves along " - i.e. each generation outdoes the last - and in an age of rapid change , the sense of crisis this induces in the older generations is amplified .
A Mrs. Wei , who chose to leave her job as a bookkeeper five years ago because of an unexpected pregnancy , thought at the time that with her ability , experience and contacts it would not be hard for her to find a new job once her child started primary school .
But as the day of her return to the world of work draws ever nearer , she feels a growing sense of panic .
" Most of my old colleagues have left , and the few I 'm still in touch with talk about nothing but things like Excel spreadsheets that I know nothing about ! "
Mrs. Wei has hinted a few times to her husband that she should just stay at home and concentrate on looking after the children .
But thinking of her husband 's grim expression whenever he gives her the housekeeping money , she does n't dare to say it plainly .
In today 's society , youth is beauty .
But in trying to show he was not out of touch with youth , Mr. Chou , the 45 - year - old boss of a computer components company , had an experience which left him not knowing whether to laugh or cry .
He arranged with his young employees to go for a barbecue in a river valley , hoping to get to know them better .
But when they arrived there , the workers formed their own groups , laughing and clowning around , and left him to get on with barbecuing the meat .
When it was done - and he was drenched in sweat - the young people , attracted by the aroma , gathered round .
But after giving him a few words of praise , they wolfed down the food and scattered again immediately , as if he did n't even exist .
" They probably thought their old fogey of a boss had just come to wait on them ! "
From then on Mr. Chou , having recognized his own place in the order of things , made no more attempts to ingratiate himself with his young employees - and in fact felt much the more relaxed for it .
More crises in middle age ?
" By middle age , you have more experience of life , and you are sure to have various realizations and regrets , " says Li Liang - che .
Even if you have no economic worries and as yet no health problems , nonetheless the flowing river of life has carried away your youth , ideals , pure love and even your loved ones , and left you with many wounds you are loth to touch and regrets you are loth to remember .
The sense that the realization of past mistakes has come too late to put them right , and of your remaining days being numbered , makes you feel despondent .
But despondency need not amount to a " crisis . "
According to overseas research , although people have more worries in middle age , only around 15 % have emotional difficulties serious enough to require psychological counseling or medication .
Sociology professor Wang Ya - ke of National Taipei University , who has always been an ardent supporter of feminism and recently became the first scholar to promote " male studies " in Taiwan , offers the following analysis :
The real reason why the " midlife crisis " has become such a hot topic in the US lies with the 75 million " baby boomers " born in the postwar period from 1946 to 1964 .
One can say that this huge generation is the one with the highest level of achievement , and the most diverse set of values , in human history .
Since they gradually began to enter middle age in the late 1980s , they have produced many reminiscences and introspective works about their own mental and spiritual journey , which have elicited a strong response .
The US 's present middle - aged generation have metamorphosed from youthful anti-war protesters and hippies into yuppie managers of multinational corporations , and from idealists into materialists .
The tensions and trauma of that transformation cause their " midlife crisis " to be especially complex .
By contrast , although Taiwan had its own baby boom from 1951 to 1966 , its middle - aged generation have not had the same life experiences , so while they too have their midlife crises , they are much less complex .
Alice Lu , director of the International Family Life Education Center , suggests that " change " would be a better term than " crisis " for the mood swings and difficulties of middle age .
Midlife change , in fact , is a natural process in the journey of life , and as people grow older and have to shoulder ever heavier responsibilities , all kinds of pressures large and small appear together at this time of life .
For example , says Lu , middle - aged people are the meat in a generational sandwich .
Their aging parents increasingly need care , while at the same time their teenage children are at their most rebellious .
Other elements in their lives , such as their job or marriage , have been in existence for ten to 20 years ; the sparkle is gone , yet they have invested too much to just walk away from them .
And again , turning to look at themselves , gray hairs are sprouting from their temples and crows ' feet appearing at the corners of their eyes , their jowls are sagging , and the thick , solid chest muscles of their youth have somehow migrated down to their bellies .
When they take their sons out for some exercise , they do n't even have the strength to do a single pull - up !
Midlife brings many uncertainties , and if it comes in a time of dramatic social change when many role models are being completely rewritten , middle - aged people may be left even more at a loss .
Life is long , the future bleak
Li Liang - che notes that firstly , life expectancy has rapidly increased .
In Taiwan , average life expectancy has risen steadily from 55 years in 1951 to 75 today .
As the journey of life lengthens , middle - aged people become more and more confused about their status in life .
A Mr. Chang , who lives in Hualien , is now 58 , nearing the upper end of middle age .
He recalls that when he saw his parents at age 60 he thought they were " ever so old , " and they seemed quite content to dandle their grandchildren , oblivious to the affairs of the world .
But now that he is approaching the same age himself , he feels he is not yet qualified to call himself old , and still less to speak lightly of retiring .
" We 're living longer , but life is more tiring ! "
He asks , only half in jest : How come nowadays middle age seems to drag on forever ?
With longer lifespans and less rigid social values , patterns of living once shared by all have been replaced by a growing diversity of individual experiences .
In middle age , some people set up successful businesses , while others lose their jobs and are faced with poverty ; working women find themselves squeezed between the exhausting demands of children and housework on the one hand and their jobs on the other , while at the same time many single women face a daily battle with loneliness .
At the age of 50 , some people already have grandchildren at their knee , while others are getting married for the first time .
With more and more people remaining single , rising divorce rates , growing numbers of unmarried mothers , increasing occurrence of infertility , and the emergence of large numbers of families where husband and wife live in different cities , or even - as for many expatriate Taiwanese business people - in different countries , many middle - aged people 's carefully laid life plans have suddenly come to nothing .
Hospital worker Lin Mei - lun -LRB- not her real name -RRB- , lives in Kaohsiung with her two children .
Her ex-husband works in Tainan , and for many years during their marriage he only came home at weekends .
Early last year a late - night phone call shattered the peaceful life she had worked so hard to build .
At the other end was a woman who venomously demanded that Lin Mei - lun give up her husband , or she would bring along her three - and - a - half - year - old illegitimate son and make a scene at the hospital !
The unbearable anguish of being
" Actually , it 's not as if I did n't have my suspicions all those years .
But I never thought things would turn out so awful !
How could I have been such a fool ? "
For the next six months , Lin Mei - lun could hardly sleep or eat .
By day she dragged herself to work like a zombie , but in the middle of the night she would wake with a start , her heart pounding so hard she could n't breathe .
The affair finally ended in divorce , but the upside is that since then her ex has actually behaved better , for he has begun to commute back to Kaohsiung from Tainan every day , and is much more patient with his son and daughter than before .
At present they are planning to remarry , but Lin worries that once her husband is again bound by the chains of marriage , he might return to his old ways .
" Life in middle age is like trying to put together a jigsaw puzzle in a gale .
The more you look at the parts you 've already assembled , the more disjointed and ugly they seem ; but it 's the parts you ca n't finish that you long for more and more , even though you know there 's precious little hope you 'll ever get them done . "
Ms. Lin , who turned 40 this year , says with an air of resignation that if a gust of wind blows the whole puzzle away , the sense of dismay and panic at being tricked by fate can drive you to distraction .
Lin Mei - lun 's mother often comes to stay , and this has done much to lighten the burden of running her household .
But many people who arrive in middle age without the support of a family can only try to weather life 's storms alone .
Ms. Chiang , still single at 46 , is an example .
When she worked as a PR manager for foreign companies such as Hewlett - Packard and Texas Instruments , she was always the highly effective superwoman .
But she realized that under the dual pressure of her need for career success and her unfulfilled emotional needs , she was approaching a state of psychological collapse .
Two years ago , she became seriously depressed .
At night she would toss and turn in bed , but the worry that lack of sleep would make her unable to get up in the morning and would affect her work performance made her even less able to sleep .
Years of looking at a computer screen was causing her vision to deteriorate rapidly , and due to working in a sealed high - tech office she was always dogged by colds , so that every day she felt under the weather .
Live for today
" I asked myself , do you really want to carry on like this ?
What matters more , your work or your health ? "
Ms. Chiang had accumulated some savings during her many years at work , but for the first three months after she resigned her job she could not help a sense of panic , feeling anxious that she might be cast out by society , and also fearing the accusing looks of her friends and family .
But gradually she began to learn to relax and let go .
" Zhuangzi says that life is toil and that death is the time for rest , but I do n't believe all that .
It should n't be that way ! "
After three months , Ms. Chiang no longer put herself under pressure , and no longer got worked up about other people 's well - meaning advice .
Once she stopped having to get up early to go to work , her anxiety about insomnia decreased greatly , and when she was able to adjust her living habits according to her own needs , her depression cleared up by itself .
She began decorating her flat , going to the gym , and cooking the food she likes , and even just sitting lost in thought , enjoying the empty spaces in life .
In particular , having freed herself from the barren existence of a " sexless wage slave " she has begun to liberate her emotional side and enjoy the pleasure of being a woman .
On the subject of family affection and affairs of the heart , Ms. Chiang has also come to a realization .
" My mother died young , and my father always regarded us three children as bloodsuckers , and never showed us any love . "
Because of this , Ms. Chiang left home early to live independently .
But in her heart , her desire for love has never ceased .
Perhaps the shadow of her childhood is behind the setbacks in her love life , so that even today she is still single .
At present , Ms. Chiang has a boyfriend ten years her junior .
" We do n't constrain each other or force each other into anything .
We 're only together when we really want to be . "
The year before last when her father was dangerously ill , he constantly rang his children , begging for their love , which aroused both her sympathy and her disgust .
Having seen through the inconstancy of family affection and romantic attachments , she swore never again to put her emotions at the mercy of others .
She wants to live truly at ease and without being tied down .
Keeping loneliness at bay
For Ms. Chiang , the single life has its freedoms and its loneliness .
But do those who are surrounded by a family have more peace of mind and happiness ?
" No , not necessarily , " answers 51 - year - old Hsiang Chi - tai , a manager at a newspaper , shaking her head .
For the last two years Hsiang Chi - tai has been plagued with capsulitis in her shoulder , and one morning when she could n't manage to fasten her bra before setting off for work , she woke up her son , a university student , to help her .
But her son said banteringly : " You old women really are a pain ! "
Once , Ms. Hsiang asked her two sons which of them was going to look after her when she was old .
But her sons tossed the question back and forth and finally nominated their rather bossy seven - year - old girl cousin !
" I knew they were only joking , but I could n't help feeling sad , and it made me even more aware that in everything you can only rely on yourself .
Anything else is phony ! " says Hsiang .
Having a husband and children , her mother and a lot of friends and relations , and with plenty to do , Ms. Hsiang is never alone , yet she can not help feeling lonely .
Sometimes at night she ca n't sleep and gets up to mop the floor .
For a time she even started playing Tetris .
" Lying in bed , playing with complete concentration , not thinking about anything else , I got up to scores of tens of thousands of points ! " she says , finding this ridiculous even herself .
" Whenever I notice I 'm getting down , I start looking for things to do , " she says .
Middle age is a minefield , and you must n't fall into the trap of letting yourself get downhearted !
The best laid plans
Apart from those to do with health , marriage and work , many other unexpected changes may occur in middle age .
When he was 38 , Chao Ning , who is now a director of the Buddhist satellite TV station LTV and the producer of many Buddhist TV programs , was invited to Houston , Texas to give a lecture .
On the plane he happened to meet Buddhist Master Hsingyun of Foguangshan Temple .
After 14 hours of the master earnestly speaking to him about the principles of Buddhist life , " Even a stone would have been moved ! "
After Chao 's lecture in Houston was over , he immediately took a plane to Los Angeles and went to Hsi Lai Temple , which was just being built .
There he sought out Master Hsingyun and declared his conversion to Buddhism , and since then he has never touched a drop of alcohol .
" Before that , I always had a rhyming couplet pasted up by my doorway which read : ' I know there is wine in this world , / But not that it can make you drunk , ' which was my way of bragging about my drinking prowess . "
What power caused him to make such a great change ?
Chao Ning himself ca n't explain .
" In the US , 38 and 49 are special ages .
I had come to realize many things , and when fate brought the right opportunity , I was ready for a change of heart , " says Chao .
He converted to Buddhism at 38 , got married at " 491?2 , " and before many years had become the " super-old dad " of three children .
The changes in Chao Ning 's life in middle age can not be described as small .
" Looking back , it seems that none of the road I took in life is what I expected . "
Chao reveals that 40 years ago when he was taking his college entrance exams , he put down all kinds of choices of university but deliberately did not include NTNU , because he thought he was not interested in being a teacher .
But although he did not study at NTNU , he went to teach there , and has been there for over 20 years .
" Every year I make a big palaver about wanting to plan my life and how I 'm going to give up teaching and concentrate on broadcasting . "
Chao continues with the same forthright , sincere smile :
" But who 'd have thought that in the blink of an eye my colleagues would be telling me : ' Old Chao , you need n't bother planning , you 're soon going to retire ! ' "
Although he never got around to planning his life , Chao , who has always liked to " follow his feelings , " feels that every step he has taken has been steady and enriching .
Now that he is about to leave middle age for the age of wisdom , this causes him to walk on eagerly , with a spring in his step .
His only real worry is for his three children , now aged seven , five and two years old .
Not daring to get old
" Sometimes when I look at their lovely faces while they sleep , I feel I hav n't done right by them , because I 'm so much older than they are . "
The phrase most often on Chao Ning 's lips nowadays is , " Because my kids are small , I ca n't get old just yet . "
Chao plays basketball three times a week , and is early to bed and early to rise .
Having become a father in middle age , he is doing his best to stay young for his children .
Midlife changes may , as for Chao Ning , be one 's own choices and bring satisfaction .
But there are so many changes which are not chosen and are impossible to prevent , and of these unemployment is one of the most fearsome .
The economic malaise which has spread through Taiwan in just the last two years is rapidly overtaking tens of thousands of middle - aged workers .
" A few days ago I heard about the death of a friend of mine .
After he was forced to retire from Taiwan Machinery Manufacturing Corporation , he set up a stand selling grilled food at Chichin bathing beach in Kaohsiung .
But before long he died of a coronary . "
Simon Chang , former managing director of the Chunghwa Telecom employees ' union , says that on hearing the news , many of the deceased man 's good friends could not help thinking : " If we 'd known he 'd die so young , we should n't have stopped him that time when he wanted to go after the boss of TMMC with a Molotov cocktail ! "
Chang , who worked at CHT for over 10 years , says that next year the company plans to cut its workforce by a full 3,000 people , which means that within the next year 3,000 people will be " forced to retire . "
But the average age of CHT 's workers is only 46
!
Who will tell me ? !
Forty - six - what an awkward age .
The majority of these workers are carrying the tremendous burden of being the breadwinner for three generations .
" The sense of uncertainty about employment has begun to affect every facet of life . "
Simon Chang says that this is a cause of marital tension , and these workers have thousands of questions sticking in their throats , such as : Will they have to interrupt their children 's education ?
Should they accept a transfer , and move the whole family somewhere else ?
What kind of second skill should they learn to keep themselves employable ?
How long a buffer period can the company give them ?
But nobody is willing to give them a clear answer .
Chang suggests that rather than the government spending vast amounts on unemployment benefits , it would be better for it to set up a life guidance and psychological counseling system for workers at all state - owned and private enterprises , as quickly as possible .
" What we want is n't money , but clear guidance to the future ! "
" For a middle - aged person , losing one 's job is just as traumatic as a car accident , falling ill , the death of a spouse or a child running away from home .
It 's an event beyond their control which suddenly turns their life upside - down . "
Chiu Chia - li , director of the Hwo Chyuan Pastoral Counseling Center , describes this kind of occurrence as a " non-normative event . "
Such events are much more traumatic than " normative events " such as job stress , a parent being paralyzed , children growing up and leaving home , or being passed over for promotion , all of which are more predictable .
Looking around us , there are many middle - aged people who , although one can not say they are unemployed , do n't have a regular career .
In his youth , Lin Hung - kui of Chungli in Taoyuan County started up in business from nothing , selling shaved iced snacks .
He did well , and used his money to buy three or four shops and apartments .
In the end he gave up his shop because the work became physically too demanding , but after several failed attempts in other lines of business , today he can only live on his savings and the rent from his apartments .
He has enough to get by , but spending the whole day doing nothing he finds it difficult to face the inquiring glances of neighbors .
Two years ago , encouraged by his wife , who works for an estate agency , Lin went on a pre-work training course at the agency .
Being stuck in among a group of young kids in their twenties , and being subjected to " shock style " training - including listening to pep talks , singing military songs and shouting slogans at the tops of their voices - made Lin feel very uncomfortable .
Finally , after sticking it out for a month , he quit the job on receiving his first pay packet .
" There are many things which young people can do without any inhibitions , but in middle age you build yourself all kinds of high walls which are very hard to escape from . "
Lin counts himself lucky , for he does n't need to break his back just to earn a pittance .
But his mood is always uncertain .
In the last two years he has begun studying the Book of Changes and fengshui , in the hope that he can take his life to a higher level .
A second spring
" In the US , indecision and depression often drive middle - aged people , especially women , to return to college , to clarify their future path through further study . "
Hwo Chyuan Pastoral Counseling Center director Chiu Chia - li quotes her own experience .
At one time she worked simultaneously as a clothing designer , a part - time community worker and a counselor .
Coming from a poor background , she always worked hard to hold down these three jobs .
But the more she saw of life , the more dissatisfied she felt with her own situation , and hoped she could make a new breakthrough .
Although she had been cautious all her life , at the age of 42 she quit her jobs , and with a sense of release tinged with trepidation , went to study overseas .
After leaving Taiwan , Chiu found a school in New York where most of the students were about her age .
Like her , many had come there because they had arrived at a point where they did not know what to do with their lives .
They had not come to earn a degree , but simply , through the process of study , to " sort out their lives bit by bit . "
After five years in New York , Chiu felt she had developed a great deal , and had enough strength to help people who needed help .
So she returned to Taiwan to become a full - time counselor .
" When I felt that I had reached a crisis , I did n't run away from it , but made the crisis into a challenge and faced it with courage . "
Looking back on this phase of her life , Chiu can not suppress a smile .
" I would n't call it success , and it does n't mean I do n't have any struggles left in my life .
But I know I 've had at least one experience of winning a battle with myself , so I can walk my future path more firmly . "
Everyone 's story of middle age is different ; the joys and sorrows of middle age mean different things to different people .

The Human Resources Industry :
A Cooling Economy Heats Up the Competition
-LRB- Teng Sue - feng / tr. by Phil Newell -RRB-
As the global economy enters a down - turn , unemployment , like an already - stretched balloon being filled relentlessly with air , threatens to burst and spoil the dream of economic security .
Last October , Taiwan 's unemployment rate surpassed 3 % , and now more than 300,000 people are jobless .
As the economy fades , business increases for human resources companies , so that the condition of the market for HR firms becomes a reflection of the overall employment situation .
It is estimated that these days , an ordinary person will change jobs an average of seven times in a typical 30 - 40 year working lifespan .
People revolve in a circle whose defining points are employment , job shifts , and unemployment .
So long as people want to find work or change their jobs , the human resources industry has a future .
And the rise of Internet technology has brought a revolution to this market which had changed so little for so long .
Take this job and ....
The largest human resources company in Taiwan is the 104 Job Bank .
The firm 's name comes from the Taiwan number for directory assistance , and suggests that " To look for a job should be as easy as getting a phone number from the operator . "
The company currently has more than 55,000 jobs and 65,000 job - seekers on file .
104 vice president Steven Su says that there are no reliable statistics for the value of the human resources market , because newspapers refuse to disclose their revenues from classified ads .
But , based on the spaces used and prices charged , it could reach as high as NT$ 10 billion , and even a conservative estimate would be NT$ 3 - 4 billion , of which NT$ 1 billion would be in the Internet employment services market .
An indicator of how good this market looks comes from the actions of the United Daily News group .
The UDN is one of the investors behind a new employment magazine called Biung , which is designed in the pattern of Japanese employment magazines , and hit the market in October of 2000 .
And last year the UDN group also opened a website called " udnjob . "
Why does this venerable media giant look so favorably on the human resources market ?
Johnson Lee , vice-president of UDN - Biung , the company that publishes Biung , who has many years of experience in publishing , says that there is a limit to how many people are reached by classified advertising .
Based on a survey conducted by AC Nielsen , only about 3 % of individuals buy newspapers to read the classified ads .
Moreover , from a firm 's point of view , Lee confesses , classified ads are " in fact rather expensive . "
It costs over NT$ 10,000 for an ad of about five centimeters square .
From the newspaper 's point of view , classified ads are n't such a hot property either , since most of the profit goes to the middlemen who take the ads .
These limitations to the traditional job hunting formula are unlikely to be resolved in the short term , says Lee .
Lee explains : " Looking at the Japanese experience , the Asahi Shimbun has a daily circulation of about 10 million , but only one page of classified advertising .
Those looking for new jobs rely more on employment magazines . "
The attraction for similar magazines in Taiwan is being helped along by the current fad for things Japanese , and also by changes in how publications are being sold , with convenience stores getting publications on to the shelves much faster than traditional bookstores ever could .
" With changes in the larger environment and the maturing of the market , this is the time to jump in . "
" The economy is in a downturn , but the human resources market always goes against the current , " says Lee .
In Japan , where the " bubble economy " phenomenon has been the worst , there are hundreds of human resources firms competing .
The leading company had an after - tax income last year of US$ 90 million .
Though there have been suggestions that the Internet is already becoming the main way to find employment , Lee contends that " the obstacles to entry are still great " for the ordinary person : You have to have a computer and be online , and you have to know how to find what you are looking for .
When you consider this , print media is still much more convenient .
The big get bigger
The two largest media groups in Taiwan , whose flagship papers are United Daily News and the China Times , began invading the human resources market two years ago , and existing job banks went on a binge of mergers .
For example , Career Magazine , which has more than a decade of experience in the field , founded an e- counterpart , which then merged with the " 37 " employment website -LRB- the resulting site is now called www.Career.com -RRB- to provide even more comprehensive services .
The big may have gotten bigger , but that has n't stopped newcomers from jumping into the fray .
The Southeast Asia Group , which had previously specialized in bringing foreign labor to Taiwan , founded the 1111 Manpower Bank last year , focusing on five main markets : education , civil service , finance , technology , and part - time work for students .
" The interesting thing about the job bank industry is that no rules of the game have yet taken shape for the Internet .
There is much room for change and flexibility , and no one can guess how much the market might change , " says 1111 public relations manager Linda Miao .
Established firms start with the advantage that many people turn to them out of habit .
But their weakness is that they have information overload , with no special features .
" If latecomers want to transcend the old media , they have to try a different approach .
The 1111 Manpower Bank has adopted the strategy of ' surrounding the cities from the countryside , ' and is striving to work with small and medium - sized enterprises , " she explains .
Finding a profitable market niche is something that all the newcomers have in mind .
Last year , Yam Digital Technology and InterServ International got together in a joint venture to establish HRGini , which targets middle - and high - ranking managers in high - tech fields who have incomes in excess of one million NT dollars per year .
Director Janet Chen relates that the company employs state - of - the - art psychological profiling services , with job candidates first being screened by a psychological consultant in one - on - one interviews ; only if the applicant fits the corporate culture will he or she be recommended to the client firm .
Looking to Greater China
One reason that people are so optimistic about the human resources market is the performance of the market leader - 104 Job Bank .
It began turning a profit after only one - and - a - half years in operation , and its revenues , which were already over NT$ 100 million by 1999 , shot up to NT$ 300 million last year .
The company had only five staff members when they set up shop in 1996 ; now , only four years later , there are 190 .
Though 104 has commissions from more firms than any other in the market , they do not dare slack off .
Steven Su says that " we will always have competition from the traditional media like China Times and United Daily News , " because after all , 104 only works through the Internet .
He does not , however , fear the threat from the CTCareer website , which is under the China Times flag , nor is there anything especially novel about the exploitation of both the Internet and magazine formats by the UDN .
Last year Acer Peripherals invested in a combination website and magazine , but they exhausted their capital within three months .
Moreover , Su is skeptical about the survivability of the UDN 's Biung , " since , at NT$ 20 per issue , they are selling at a loss . "
But the people at UDN - Biung are very optimistic .
As Johnson Lee says : " Some people try to open the market with a shovel .
We are using a bulldozer . "
The UDN group is undertaking a three - pronged attack to crush their competition : continuing to access the wide readership of newspapers , targeting the high - tech sector through the Internet , and using the magazine format for regional companies with small budgets .
Based on past experience , most companies have used up their employment advertising budgets by year 's end , so the market is at a low ebb .
However , when the Chinese New Year passes , many employees , having collected their annual bonuses , want to change jobs , and this is when the market really heats up .
Although the manpower industry focuses on bringing together employers with job - seekers , there is much more to it these days than passing along CVs .
Firms now offer psychological screening , career - suitability evaluations , job training , and reassignment of staff .
Moreover , all these firms are turning their eyes toward the Greater China market .
The 104 Job Bank has been operating beyond Taiwan for some time , having registered its trademark and set up a website in the PRC two years ago -LRB- though it uses 115 in the mainland since that is the number of directory assistance there -RRB- .
HRGini 's Janet Chen says that there is a huge potential client base in the US and the Asia - Pacific region for tech - savvy staff .
And Johnson Lee notes : " If Taiwan can become the main axis of human resources management in the Greater China region , not only will this industry not be adversely affected by Taiwan 's economic downturn , it will also not be hurt by the large - scale move by Taiwan companies to the PRC . "
As we watch the race heating up between amalgamated veteran firms and ambitious newcomers , let us hope that the real winners turn out to be employers and job - seekers .

Magazines are also trying to get a piece of the job - hunting market .

The husband has been laid off and there is no money for the children 's tuition .
What can one do ?
Women 's groups have protested at the Legislative Yuan , calling for more attention to the problem of unemployment .
The government will spend more than NT$ 60 billion on infrastructure projects expected to create more than 40,000 jobs .

About Mayaw Biho
-LRB- Alexandra Liu / tr. by Robert Taylor -RRB-
Mayaw Biho -LRB- Chinese name Peng Shih - sheng -RRB- was born in 1969 .
His father is a native of Hunan Province in mainland China and his mother is an Amis .
Mayaw Biho , who calls himself half Amis , grew up in the Amis village of Cero -LRB- Chunjih -RRB- in Hualien County .
He never lived away from the village until he went to study cinematography at Taipei 's Shih Hsin University .
After coming to live in the city , Mayaw gradually came to realize how mainstream society in Taiwan regards the island 's aboriginal peoples , and became aware of the gap between reporting and reality .
He wished to break away from the all - pervasive practice of reporting aboriginal affairs from a purely Han Chinese perspective , and approach them anew from an aboriginal standpoint .
From filming " Aboriginal News Magazine " and " Our Island " for Public Television Service and " Declaration of Life " for Super TV , to becoming the independent director he is today , Mayaw has always insisted on following his own ideas .
Mayaw loves documentary films above all else .
While at university , he began making his first four films , " Spring Sun " is Our Name : Pangcah Paddlers from Spring - Sun Village ; As Life , As Pangcah ; Children in Heaven and Pangcah Artist : Gi Lahaz .
After graduating , he completed such films as Dear Rice Wine , You Are Defeated ; National Bandits and The Land in Our Hearts .
Mayaw 's filming of the story of Lukar Maku 's life has already entered its third year .
As Life , As Pangcah was only the first part .
During his summer vacation in the first year of filming , Mayaw went to live in Lukar 's home .
He spent all his time with the old man , and witnessed his perseverance and insistence on upholding Amis culture .
Lukar said that Mayaw 's documentary " shows just what it is a person of my age does . "
But he also told him : " Mayaw , you have to work faster .
You must come and see me more often . "
Mayaw too urges himself to work harder to finish editing the films he has already shot - of Lukar talking about tribal life , hunting , religion and war - to allow the story of the Amis to be told on this island where they have lived for thousands of years .
Chinese New Year 's Eve - Doing it the Modern Way
With celebrations for the long - anticipated start of the year 2000 barely over , Chinese people began busily preparing to mark another new year .
" Spring Festival , " as it is known , brings a longer break from work - compared with Western New Year - and is an altogether more meaningful occasion for the Chinese .
Amid today 's sweeping tide of modernization , Spring Festival is probably the only annual occasion left with a truly " Chinese " flavor .
So how do people celebrate Chinese New Year nowadays ?
How much of the ancient form of the festival survives , and what new elements have been added in our time ?
Under the crisp and pleasant skies of late December , Mrs. Pu , a woman in her late fifties who lives in a military dependents ' village in Taoyuan , hastens to place her order for 40 catties -LRB- 24 kg -RRB- of streaky pork .
When the meat arrives she chops it into one - catty strips , then steeps these in a marinade of dry - fried star anise and other spices , mixed with rock sugar , salt and Gaoliang liquor .
After several days of preparation , the result is larou , or end - of - year cured meat .
There 's still over one month to go before Spring Festival , but as Mrs. Pu explains : " It takes a fairly long time to make larou , and you have to make allowance for the weather .
It 's best to get going early so that you have the meat ready to give out to friends and relatives in time for New Year . "
Her ever - popular larou is made in accordance with a time - tested recipe .
She adds the spices in their special proportions , and then seals the meat in a vat to marinate for six days so as to ensure a full flavor .
After being removed from the vat the strips are slowly smoked over a mixture of sugarcane bark , charcoal , orange peel and rice husks , until they have acquired a lovely luster and exude a delicious aroma .
Finally the cured strips are hung out for two or three days in the sun to draw off excess fat .
For Mrs. Pu and her husband , the traditional lunar new year has more significance than the Western version .
It provides the opportunity for making food in the traditional style of their home region , much of which they give to others , and also brings the whole family together for an eagerly awaited celebration .
New Year 's Eve dinner is the highlight , with three generations - more than ten hungry mouths - gathered for the feast .
" We need at least ten New Year dishes , " says Mrs. Pu .
In addition to servings of chicken , duck , fish and pork , they always have some of the specialties of her husband 's home region , Anhui Province in mainland China , including yuanzi meatballs -LRB- minced pork blended with chopped spring onion , ginger , garlic and rice noodles , rolled in cornstarch flour and deep - fried -RRB- .
Other favorites such as pearl balls -LRB- meatballs wrapped in sticky rice -RRB- , pork knuckle in brown sauce , and mixed vegetables , dishes that Mr. and Mrs. Pu like to make for themselves and others all year round , also appear at the table , all cooked with extra special attention for New Year .
In fact , preparations for the feast begin three or four days before the event itself .
Slowly warming up
The timing of Chinese New Year is determined by the traditional lunar calendar and marks an important transition , the point when Winter gives way to Spring .
In China , a country founded on farming , there has always been a tangible link between seasonal changes and the pattern of agricultural production .
As this link was absorbed into people 's lives it gave rise to the rituals of rural existence , the most prominent of which marked the conclusion of the natural cycle at the end of every year .
Thus New Year became the most important of all traditional festivals , symbolizing endless rebirth and the continuation of the natural cycle .
While underpinning the annual cycle of festivals and the daily routine of the people , New Year also , through its religious - type observances , came to express Chinese people 's ideas about life , nature , and clan society .
The attitudes and lifestyles of the Chinese are also given full expression through the various activities that take place during the holiday .
Traditions such as sweeping the house to " drive out the old and bring in the new , " venerating the gods , making offerings to ancestors , having the whole family eat together and stay up late on New Year 's Eve , calling on friends and relatives on New Year 's day , and - for married women - visiting their parents on the following day .
In spite of the changes wrought by modernization , which make it impossible for the New Year to be celebrated in exactly the way that it used to be , and regardless of the simplifications that have taken place , Spring Festival remains the longest and most important holiday in the calendar .
It is , as ever , a time of plenty and of family reunion - a great occasion for everyone .
Homeland of the soul
Food is an obsession with the Chinese , and never more so than at New Year when virtually every family - like Mrs. Pu 's in Taoyuan - enjoys one or two dishes prepared to their own " private " recipe , plus other edible treats with special symbolism .
For most people , dishes such as these are forever bound up with the spirit of New Year .
Writer Lin Wen - yueh has penned numerous articles on the culture of food and drink in recent years , including a vignette -LRB- from her collection of essays Epicurean Notes -RRB- about New Year with the family , entitled " Luobo Pudding . "
" When the Chinese do New Year , one type of specialty is indispensable : New Year pudding . . . .
However , as China covers such a vast territory , this pudding comes in different versions according to region .
For example , people in the belt south of the Yangtze River generally eat " Ningpo pudding , " made from sticky rice shaped into broad bars , while those hailing from Guangdong and the Southern Fujian region go for luobo pudding , made from a mixture of shredded white turnip -LRB- luobo -RRB- and long - grain rice .
As Lin writes : " Although my family moved around a lot when I was little , Mother was quite stubborn about personally taking charge in the kitchen every New Year to make luobo pudding for the whole family .
So when we spent New Year in Shanghai , we did n't have Ningpo pudding like the rest of the people there , and when we were in Tokyo we did n't have the " mirror cake " that they like in Japan .
No matter where we were , it was always luobo pudding for us . "
Lin recalls that there were so many mouths to feed at New Year that they had to use two or three large bamboo steamers to make the puddings .
Come New Year , the children were always attracted by the unusually busy atmosphere in the kitchen , and loved running in and out to check on what was going on , meanwhile getting under everyone 's feet .
Lin 's mother was n't too happy about this , and the kitchen helpers would impatiently wave the kids away , calling : " Shoo ! Shoo ! Go outside and play ! "
However , as Lin grew up , her mother would call her and the other girls to her side to watch and help out .
She said : " Follow closely , now .
One day I 'll be gone , and you 'll have to do this all by yourselves . "
Making luobo pudding is a demanding process and requires plenty of ingredients .
Nowadays there 's no need to wait for New Year - the pudding can be sampled throughout the year at Hong Kong - style dimsum restaurants or bought readymade in the market .
But come the last month in the lunar calendar , Lin Wen - yueh still prepares several luobo puddings the old - fashioned way , so that her family and friends can enjoy New Year pudding " the way mama used to make it . "
Difficult time of year
Nowadays it is n't so easy to recreate the elaborate New Years of the past .
The speeded - up , stripped - down pace of modern life has reduced the event in scale , and people now regard New Year in different ways according to how it fits in with their lives .
Surveys show that among the Chinese , New Year is ranked as one of the most stressful facets of life .
A tale from the past shows how New Year has always been a source of financial pressure for families .
During the Ming dynasty -LRB- 1368 - 1644 -RRB- , a Fuzhou prefectural magistrate named Cai Junmo issued an order for every family in the district to light seven lanterns for Lantern Festival -LRB- the 15th day of the first lunar month -RRB- .
One of the residents of the prefecture , a man named Chen Lie , satirized the magistrate 's order with a verse that he painted on a large lantern :
" In the homes of the rich , lanterns are as plentiful as rice in the granary /
In the homes of the poor , a single lantern reduces fathers and sons to misery /
The carefree magistrate may not be aware of this /
And simply complains that the music is n't good enough . "
In the Haifeng area of Guangdong Province , there is a saying to describe the hardship that the holiday brings for the poor - whom the festival often relieved of a whole year 's worth of painstakingly accumulated surplus : " Those with money celebrate New Year ; those without money get stripped bare . "
This was especially so given that the " close of the year " was also the time when creditors turned up to claim their dues and " close " their accounts .
Chen Chih - fan , the scientist and well - known essayist , once described how he , as the eldest son in a poor family , used to spend the days before New Year writing and selling spring couplets in the market , so as to help his father pay off debts and buy goodies for his siblings .
On account of his skill at calligraphy , Chen spent many a New Year in this fashion .
As a successful scholar he was later able to recall this episode with pride , yet the bitterness and hurt still showed through in his words .
Tough work , year after year
On top of economic pressures , New Year , for many housewives , brings the added burden of endless household chores .
In the past , this meant a nonstop round of house cleaning , making pudding , doing the New Year shopping and making new clothes , starting from the 8th day of the 12th lunar month .
There was also the matter of performing the prescribed observances to heaven and earth , the ancestors , the kitchen god and various other deities .
Things are simpler nowadays , but putting together a New Year dinner to fill the bellies of everyone in the family still presents an enormous culinary and physical challenge .
For those who live far from the parental home , there 's the added trial of transport conditions - congested roads , fully - booked trains and airplanes - to foil the plans of all who would hurry home in time to spend New Year 's Eve with the clan .
And if you live in a large family with plenty of old folk and youngsters - all expecting red envelopes of cash - your hard - earned year - end bonus may well be gone by the time New Year is over .
In recent years , New Year has increasingly shown up on the agenda of the women 's movement .
Many women now object to the tradition of spending New Year 's Eve with the family of their spouse , rather than at the homes of their own parents , and point out that this is one of the nasty little legacies of a patriarchal society , something which goes against the modern principle of sex equality .
" I 'm an only daughter , and my father has passed away , so I really hate leaving mom to spend New Year 's Eve all alone . "
" When we go over to my husband 's family , it 's nothing but nonstop cleaning and cooking ! "
These are some of the many complaints expressed by women writing to the letters pages in the press .
For many people , the solution is to book a holiday abroad at this time of year so as to avoid the whole occasion .
Others opt to splash out on dinner at a hotel or restaurant so that no - one has to worry about getting everything ready .
For modern , urban families , these are two of the fashionable and convenient new ways of surviving New Year .
A bittersweet evening
" The most scary thing is the deep - seated clan mentality of the Chinese , " says Li Yuan , an author known for his writings on the topic of family .
" It can tangle the relationship between parents and children into a never - unraveled web of pain and intimacy - which does n't always make for happy family reunions . "
No wonder New Year 's Eve is frequently a time of generational conflict .
Li describes the case of his own family .
His mother and father came from Hakka backgrounds on the mainland , and as clan identity is strongly emphasized in Hakka culture , his father used to require all his children and grandchildren to be at the family home for dinner on New Year 's Eve .
Concerned about the burden on the old couple , Li persuaded them to hold the annual get - together at his house , with dinner prepared by his wife and sisters .
Striving valiantly to create a party atmosphere , Li took a leaf out of " Old Laizi 's " book , -LRB- Old Laizi was a legendary paragon of filial piety who acted like a child well into his seventies just to keep his parents amused -RRB- , dreaming up little pranks with the help of his children .
For example , they gave mischievous names to each of the dishes served for New Year 's Eve dinner , like " Dongfang the Invincible 's Chopped - off Willy , " " The Flower of Guanyin 's Slender Waist , " and " Sea Cucumber , Squid and Meatballs - a Three - in - one World . "
" The mood of good cheer and togetherness at New Year can indeed leave some heart - warming memories , " acknowledges Li Yuan .
" But the occasion can also dredge up less pleasant associations from the past . "
During New Year 's Eve six years ago , Li 's father could n't stop himself getting worked up , in spite of the family 's best efforts to keep the mood light .
Dinner was nearly over when the old fellow demanded that his children come to his side , and announced : " I want to square up accounts with every one of you , each in turn . . . . "
He began to lecture them about how hard he had struggled in his youth to bring them all up , recalling every little incident as though it were yesterday .
He broke down in tears once he got onto the things that had hurt him , and after that there was no calming him down .
" He had absolutely no idea that his children all had to swallow their own share of hurt and disappointment while growing up , but never complained to him .
Now each of them felt afresh the grievances of childhood , and began to strike back , one after another . "
Li described the ensuing scenario :
" Some wheeled out their heavy artillery and some used the machine - gun approach .
Cannon and gunfire rang out on that cold rainy night , while tears flowed and fireworks exploded .
The old bruiser , nearly 80 years old , was struck speechless .
His authority lay in tatters , long since torn down by his adult offspring .
He 'd taken so many hits by then that he was riddled with bullet - holes .
He slumped miserably back into his chair , lips quivering as if to speak , but no words coming from his mouth . "
The evening ended in tears and awkwardness .
" Our family was quite poor when we were growing up , " says Li , " and Father suffered plenty of frustrations on our behalf .
He thought that we had n't properly repaid him once we had grown up , and felt quite bitter about it .
But he did n't realize that we too , growing up in such circumstances , faced hardship and frustration .
Like my elder sister who had to work her way through school .
Everyone had something to get off his chest .
It all got quite heated . "
Li felt depressed and guilty about the way the evening turned out .
When he went over to his parents house the next day to pay his New Year respects , he asked his children to help smooth things over , and he scrubbed clean the toilet bowl as penance .
Li Yuan 's father passed away the year before last .
His mother , more relaxed about things than her husband , was n't concerned about doing a New Year 's Eve dinner , so last year the family cancelled the tradition .
" Mom decided to take a trip abroad .
My family and I like the unusual quiet that descends on Taipei 's streets for the period of the festival , and since we did n't want to make any special arrangements , we just stayed home and had a good rest . "
A quiet New Year
" What we are missing , " says author Yang Hsiao - yun , " is a way of bringing new meaning into the old tradition , a way of spending New Year that suits ordinary people . "
Yang 's strongest association with New Year is of going to do the New Year 's shopping with the grown - ups when she was little .
" We were always very thrifty in those days , without extra cash for new things .
New Year was the only time when we got to bring bulging bags and packages back to the house .
Just the sight of all those treats - chicken , duck , fish and pork ; candies and cookies ; fruits and soda drinks - was a thrill for us .
Then there were all the New Year presents , like new clothes , shoes and hats .
At New Year our parents liked to dress the girls in red from head to toe , for good luck and for fun .
We looked as if we 'd been dipped in a tub of haw juice . "
In spite of the excitement that she remembered feeling , as a child , about getting to wear new clothes and new hats , Yang later began to question this way of spending New Year .
She felt especially turned off by the orgy of consumption connected with the festival .
" It was only after I had kids of my own that I began to rethink the importance of New Year - partly out of nostalgia , and partly to pass the tradition on to my children , " admits Yang .
Nowadays she emphasizes just three aspects of the occasion : getting the family together , enjoying the festive spirit , and having a rest .
" At one point we tried the fashionable thing , taking the family away for a vacation , but being abroad we really missed that festive flavor . "
Eventually she returned to the traditional form , making the New Year 's Eve dinner herself , and always including a Manchurian - style pickled cabbage hotpot prepared just the way her parents used to do it .
-LRB- Her father hailed from Liaoning Province in mainland China . -RRB-
" With life as busy and stressful as it is the rest of the year , we decided to drop the formal New Year gathering .
Instead , we now spend the time relaxing at home , doing whatever we fancy , be it sitting quietly and reading , listening to music , going on an outing , or talking about the ups and downs of the past year .
Or we might invite a couple of close friends round to reminisce about old times .
It 's quiet , and it 's really satisfying .
" On the other hand , " continues Yang , " the end of the year can also serve as a reminder for people to review their past actions . "
She always sets aside a little time for herself on New Year 's Eve to do just this .
As midnight approaches , and with all the household chores taken care of , Yang settles down to quietly reflect on how she has grown during the past twelve months , and to draw up her personal " profit and loss sheet " for the year .
" It 's nothing to do with money , " she stresses .
" It 's a way of measuring whether I 've achieved my objectives , in my work and in my personal maturity .
I ask myself what my bad habits are .
It 's a kind of New Year 's Eve dish for the spirit ! "
Yang feels that if we redefine New Year in terms of its contemplative and spiritual meaning , rather than just regarding it as an occasion for feasting and partying , then we can better sense how time passes , and see that another phase in our working lives has been completed .
In this way we can make our wishes for the year ahead , setting goals for work and for personal growth , without getting maudlin about time 's passage and the meaninglessness of it all .
For the Chinese , the family is the basic unit for celebrating New Year , but the family , like society , has been changing in recent years .
Couples whose children have grown up and moved out , face the " empty nest syndrome , " while many individuals , particularly among the elderly , live on their own .
However , for people like these , and for the homeless , there are still ways of enjoying " a good get - together " at New Year .
All together now
One month before last year 's Chinese New Year , artist Wang Cheng - liang placed some articles in the press seeking others like himself - single people with nothing special to do on New Year 's Eve - to register for a New Year 's Eve dinner and party at his studio .
You did n't have to know anyone else going .
Plenty of people took up the offer , and the party was packed .
For Wang , it was the most fun he 'd ever had at New Year .
Lin Wen - yueh moved to California once her children had grown up and started families of their own , so she can no longer spend New Year with her immediate family .
But her enthusiasm for the festival has n't waned .
" Now I spend New Year with friends who are in similar circumstances to me .
Each of us brings a dish for the meal , and makes his own contribution .
It 's all very relaxed . "
For Lin , friendship is as heart - warming as family ties .
" New Year is part of our shared cultural and ethnic memory .
It 's a homeland of the soul for every one of us .
The external form may have changed , but the memory of some inner yearning , that sense of needing to belong , these are things that can never change . "
For those often - overlooked old folk and street people , there are special New Year dinners organized by private welfare groups , enabling them to share in the human warmth of the occasion .
Last year the Buddha 's Light International Association organized New Year 's Eve dinners in the north , center and south of Taiwan , which were attended by more than 5,000 old folk who live alone .
This year they are repeating the exercise , and are including a special event in Nantou County to bring some warmth and love to elderly survivors of the 9 / 21 earthquake there .
Another group , the Creation Social Welfare Foundation - which is well known for its work with street people and for taking care of vegetative - state patients - runs an annual New Year 's Eve party for homeless people .
" Giving and serving , these too form part of the meaning and purpose of New Year . "
The Venerable Yung Fu of the Buddha 's Light International Association hopes that today 's well - fed , well - clothed people of Taiwan can extend the warmth and love of their own families out to society at large , and especially to those most in need of attention , so as to widen and elevate the meaning of New Year .
It is no surprise that amid the hectic pace of modern life , some of the relaxed good fun has gone out of Chinese New Year .
But as a custom that has been part of the culture for so long , it continues to occupy a unique position in our hearts and lives .
What remains to be seen is how well we can adapt and update this ancient tradition to fit the changing needs of modern society .
Gods of Wealth , Please Report !
-LRB- Chang Chin - ju / photos by Hseuh Chi - kuang / tr. by Jonathan Barnard -RRB-
The Taiwanese economy may be slump - ing , but people still have to eat and drink .
The Chinese have traditionally listed seven essentials for any household : firewood , rice , oil , salt , soy sauce , vinegar , and tea .
But there is still another item that only seems to grow more indispensable the harder times become .
Indeed some say that unless you have a wealth charm - " the eighth household essential " - you will never find peace of mind !
Here at the start of the 21st century , the Year of the Snake is upon us .
Have you found your path to prosperity ?
Have you identified the mascots of money - making ?
If you ask the shopkeepers in the main streets or back alleys , they will tell you that the favorite figure of the moment is the Maneki Neko , or Japanese " beckoning cat , " whose Chinese name is literally " wealth - attracting cat " -LRB- -LRB-c-RRB-?Ìö]o? -RRB- .
The Maneki Neko has ridden a wave of fashion for things Japanese to superstardom in Taiwan , and its sales have n't suffered a whit with the slumping economy .
Not only are Japanese foodstuff shops and Japanese product counters at department stores quickly selling out of their regular shipments of these feline fortune finders , Maneki Nekos were even on sale in the run - up to New Year 's at the roadside stalls selling traditional Chinese holiday paraphernalia , such as lanterns and spring couplets on red paper .
They smiled flirtatiously at shoppers from between the potbellied Buddhas and the mock gold ingots .
Amid the crowds and the hubbub at the Sogo in Taipei , Taiwan 's top - grossing department store , it 's clear that these kitties bring more than just good financial fortune .
Check out this rack full of copycat charms that have come from Japan on Maneki Neko 's tail .
Take , for instance , this litter of Fengshui Kitties , lined up here with each holding a different colored pearl : red , purple , blue , white or yellow .
The Fengshui Kitty with the yellow pearl , which specializes in attracting money , is now selling even better than Maneki Neko !
Foreign cats , local toads
But there is no need to restrict our survey to foreign felines .
Chinese are , as a rule , fengshui experts who will consider the auspiciousness of virtually anything .
For that matter , the Chinese display a willingness to believe in the auspiciousness of just about anything !
Hence , they have never lacked their own stately or amusing charms to pull in wealth and keep it within a household .
The Chinese folk charms of financial good fortune have a great variety of origins , an abundance that is due in large part to the Chinese people 's virtuosity at making things up as they go along .
For starters , there is the God of Wealth on the peachwood charms that people bring out for the New Year .
Round - faced and smiling , he wears a mandarin 's hat and robes , and his very presence seems to exude affluence and good times .
Amiable and ubiquitous local land gods can also be seen grasping silver or gold ingots , doing their bit to bring wealth to the neighborhood .
By some twist of fate even the Daoist deity Guan Gong , who never made much money during his time as a mortal , has come to be regarded as a god of wealth .
Love of money has been a constant across the ages , observable in such time - honored Chinese traditions as burning incense to pray to gods of wealth .
Many Chinese wealth charms are traditional objects that have long been ascribed these powers .
The three - legged toad , whose origins lie in a classic folktale , is an old favorite that has never fallen from popular favor .
According to legend , a Daoist master named Liu Hai and a three - legged golden toad scattered gold coins across the land .
If one of these fell into your home , your family would enjoy prosperity for thousands of years .
The earliest known depiction of this toad is the " toad in the moon " found in a Han dynasty silk painting that was unearthed in the Mawangdui Tombs .
Because of the legend of Liu Hai teasing the golden toad , toads became auspicious symbols revered throughout China ever since the Eastern Han dynasty -LRB- AD 25 - 220 -RRB- .
According to legend , Liu Hai was the student of a miserly Daoist master .
This master turned out to be corrupt and was put into a well for punishment , where he became a three - legged toad .
Liu Hai 's attempts to save his master repeatedly failed .
Finally , Liu Hai came up with the idea of tying a silk thread to a traditional Chinese coin , which he threw into the well .
When his teacher saw the coin , he could n't help but bite .
From that moment , the three - legged toad became a symbol of wealth , and the image of Liu Hai on the back of the toad with a large gold ingot in his outstretched arms became a favorite subject for folk art .
In the 1980s the three - legged toad managed to separate from Liu Hai .
It came to be marketed as an auspicious figure in its own right .
The higher the stock market soared , the more plastic three - legged toads were pulled from their manufacturing molds .
You could also buy brass toads that held coins in their mouths .
These served as money charms for shops , whose owners would turn them facing outward in the morning so as to attract wealth inside .
Then , when the shopkeepers closed their stores at dusk , they 'd turn the toads around , so that none of the good fortune would slip away overnight .
Today you can still see three - legged toads at jade markets and night markets .
It 's just that with the fashion for things Japanese , Maneki Nekos prevail , and figures of three - legged toads are not nearly as prevalent as they once were .
But the potbellied , grinning figure of Maitreya Buddha is so pleasing that his popularity even today is no less than Maneki Neko 's .
You can often find the two of them next to each other in stores and markets .
Moreover , the potbellied Buddha by himself is still a popular motif for china , as well as for jade and wood carvings .
Maitreya Buddha has also been transformed into the figure of a monk carrying a burlap sack .
Whatever you give to this old monk , he puts in the sack behind him .
But as this smiling old man takes with one hand , he gives with the other .
Look carefully at the plump Buddhas found in stores and homes .
Notice the full sack of stuff that is often found behind them .
What treasures lie within ?
That we leave to the beholder 's imagination .
Money trees and golden eggs
Then there are the assorted golden animals or other objects that are variations on the theme of the golden hen , the Chinese equivalent of the goose that lays the golden egg .
The name for the spotted leopard in Chinese is jinqian bao , or " money leopard " - so named because its spots look like coins .
This name has made the spotted leopard a common motif for costume jewelry .
Sometimes auspicious objects are chosen for a play on words .
For instance , because the first character in the Chinese compound for " coffin " -LRB- guan: ÛDÌ’ -RRB- is a homonym for a character that means " high official " -LRB- -LRB-c-RRB-x -RRB- , and the second character -LRB- cai: s? -RRB- is a homonym for a character that means " wealth " or " money " -LRB- Ìö] -RRB- , coffins became popular symbols of good fortune a few years back .
Foot - long red coffins would sit on counters in big stores , and people would carry around mini-coffin key chains .
Normally superstitious people were willing to break the strong taboo associated with coffins because of the double allusion to the phrase " sheng guan fa cai " -LRB- Ìò...-LRB-c-RRB-x˙goÌö] -RRB- , which means , " Attain high office and make a fortune . "
The owners of the various shops that sell wealth charms all agree that when sales of other lines flag , business for these charms only increases .
They are true " money trees . "
With the economic downturn , Wang Nien - feng , a florist who often works for the television and entertainment industries , has had plenty to sigh about .
He reveals that showbusiness promotion budgets have been cut in half .
As a consequence , his flower - arranging business has likewise shriveled .
But just a few steps down the street is another flower shop whose salesclerk says that business is n't bad at all .
Looking around , you notice that there is a collection of flashily ornamented " gold ingot trees " at the front of the shop .
These are placed in pots shaped liked gold ingots .
Mock gold ingots also hang like fruit from the branches , which are festooned with red ribbon bows .
At the other end of the store is a line of long - branched gold money trees .
Thick round leaves grow from the branches in groups of four , giving each branch the appearance of being a string of coins .
Although these imported plants are in high demand , none of the salesclerks at any of the stores seem to have any idea what the proper name for them is .
In any case , most buyers do n't ask .
As long as the trees are said to attract money , they are sure to fly out of the store and into people 's homes .
" These types of money trees are the favorite of banks , " affirms the owner of the " Tip Top " flower store on Pateh Road .
But banks are far from the only purchasers of them .
When the economy is weak , shops frequently close , undergo renovations and open up again with new proprietors .
These inexpensive and auspicious money charm trees make excellent gifts for friends opening new stores !
For the florists who are smart enough to sell these arrangements made with ivy , shaving - brush trees and " gold ingot trees , " it is only a slight exaggeration to say that their business improves the worse the economy gets !
To bank on fish tanks
But the truth is that objects said to attract money sell just as well in good times as bad , for when the economy is strong , people are willing to spend large sums to ensure that they can hold onto their wealth .
For instance , the stock market last peaked amid a craze for fengshui fish tanks and crystals .
Since water is the Chinese element that indicates wealth , many business people like to keep fish tanks .
Huang Chiung - yu , who has been selling fish and aquariums for more than a decade , points out that for a few years entrepreneurs were installing NT$ 200,000 - 300,000 fish tanks in their homes or offices .
While the falling stock market has meant that aquarium sellers have had to lower their prices , they have found no shortage of customers willing to take advantage of these bargains .
Since fish tanks help you change your fate when something bad is expected , and otherwise help to attract money , they are perennial hot sellers .
A Miss Lai works for a broadband Internet access provider and is responsible for taking care of two large office fish tanks .
Her company has been hit by the slumping economy and is striving to cut down on expenses .
Nevertheless , there is no consideration being given to reducing the NT$ 5,000 - 6,000 spent each month on cleaning the tanks , let alone any thought of cutting back on the money spent on fish food or the occasional replacement fish .
The Core Pacific eCommerce Co. , which just this year got involved in the fish and aquarium business , correctly predicted that the economic downturn would mean an increase in those needing fish tanks to soothe their financial psyches .
With an eye on this group , as well as on those consumers replacing old money charms with new ones or those buying auspicious objects for the New Year , Core Pacific devised a marketing plan to sell the seven major money - charmed fish .
The company takes orders over the Internet , offers the services of experts who make house calls , and delivers .
Customers hence save time and energy .
Core 's best - selling fish include carp , goldfish , and " blood parrotfish , " which are red and round like balls .
The market for crystals has also managed to retain its luster .
Crystals are said to alter force fields and thereby improve one 's physique , regulate one 's qi , and bolster one 's finances .
For going on ten years now , they 've been hot sellers in Taiwan .
Crystal markets have sprung up like mushrooms after rain , and shops where a premium is put on color coordination , such as florists or clothing stores , often use unfinished whole crystals or amethysts to add panache to their decor .
Huang Hao - chuan , an importer , exporter and processor of gems , says that crystals in Taiwan used to come exclusively from Brazil and Russia , but recently mainland China and Madagascar have emerged as additional sources of supply .
The growth in supply suggests that crystals ' star has n't fallen yet .
Huang explains that the price of crystals is n't what it once was .
Yet sales quantities are up , thereby offsetting the falling profit margins .
May you prosper !
While the hot sales of money charms are no doubt partly attributable to the enterprising efforts of dealers and retailers , the slumping economy and growing number of fortunetellers have also played a part in the boom .
Those who habitually get their fortunes told are naturally given to installing a fish tank here at one moment and positioning a crystal over there the next .
But recently many people who are not ordinarily superstitious have sought the services of fortunetellers when they 've seen the value of their stocks decline .
They might be told something along these lines : " Get a dragon or a God of Wealth carved in a topaz and the deity Taishang Laojun carved in an amethyst , and hang them over your chest from a string of Chinese knots .
Otherwise , you can hang a yucai painting at home , and perform good deeds on the third , sixth and eighth day of every lunar month .
Only by so doing will you meet with good fortune ! "
If you want to avoid going to all this trouble , you might instead consult the traditional Chinese farmers ' almanac , which suggests that during bad times people can turn their fortunes by repositioning their water coolers or hot water dispensers .
Of course , it 's up the individual to decide whether to believe in any of this .
May you meet with good fortune and prosperity in the New Year !

My Heart is in Macau :
" Local Portuguese " Carlos Marreiros
-LRB- Jackie Chen / tr. by Brent Heinrich -RRB-
Around the time of the Macau handover , questions that were hot in the Western media were , What is " Macaense " ?
And what is native Macau culture ?
This is Carlos Marreiros 's story .
The story began during the era of great sailing ships .
Four hundred years ago , a Portuguese trading vessel dropped anchor off the island of Macau , intent on doing business with imperial China .
That one brief rest stop destined Macau to become a cultural montage that includes Chinese , Indian , Malay , Portuguese and other European influences .
Today , Macaense -LRB- or Macanese -RRB- , the free mix of the various ethnic currents of Macau has become the most vibrant element of its culture .
" Without it , Macau would n't exist , " says Carlos Marreiros , who once served as director of the Macau government 's bureau of culture , and now works as an architect , painter , author and poet .
Ethnic melting pot
Marreiros is a typical Macanese .
His grandfather was Portuguese , his grandmother Chinese .
His mother has a mix of Spanish and Malay blood .
In Macau , he 's what is known as a " local Portuguese . "
Marreiros was born in Macau , but " most of my education took place in Europe , " he says .
He attended university in Lisbon , received his master 's degree in Germany , and went on to study landscaping in Sweden .
His principal impressions of China come from his family and his contacts with Chinese people .
When he was young , Marreiros worked in a Macau post office .
One of his coworkers was a Chinese of the older generation , who often chatted with him about Tang - dynasty poetry , and Chinese proverbs and myths .
For a while Marreiros taught Chinese people how to speak Portuguese .
" I learned quite a lot about the way many Chinese people think , " he says .
Carlos Marreiros speaks fluent Portuguese , Cantonese , English and German .
He has done research on traditional Chinese poetry , and has included some in his Portuguese - language writings .
He personally manifests a blend of Chinese and Western influences .
Marreiros emphasizes that in addition to Chinese and Portuguese influences , Macau also has its own unique blend of culture - Macaense , which is exhibited in " local Portuguese " of mixed ancestry such as himself .
" The world 's first mixed-race culture appeared in Macau , " he says .
Now with the convenience of travel and transportation , the intermingling of black , white and yellow peoples is nothing new , but 400 years ago , the people of Macau intertwined cultures from as far afield as India , Southeast Asia and Japan .
Their influences can be seen everywhere in the cuisine , architecture and literature of Macau .
Intellectual assets
In the enclave 's restaurants , such classic Macanese dishes as curry and Portuguese chicken are served up with a wide variety of seasonings , blending the sweet flavors of Cantonese dishes with the rich , tangy taste of old-style Indian fare .
One example is Macanese baoguo , a combination of Chinese sausage , cabbage and tripe - not precisely Portuguese , nor Cantonese either .
The exteriors of traditional Macau buildings are noticeably southern European in style .
But Marreiros , an architect , points out that while the outsides of many houses are European , the arrangement of rooms and furniture inside is often done in a Chinese manner .
" The important space is given to the father and the eldest son .
The remaining side rooms are for the ladies of the house and others - quite different from Portuguese architecture , " he says .
And the details of ornamentation , such as engravings , glasswork and wood carvings , are actually rendered in Qing - dynasty fashion .
The most representative example is Macau 's oldest church , Sao Paolo -LRB- the ruins of St. Paul 's -RRB- .
Its surviving stone facade is embellished with stone carvings not only of such Catholic images as angels and the Virgin Mary , but also of dragon - and - phoenix motifs and fishing boats , as well as Catholic phrases written in Chinese characters .
Marreiros believes that the hybrid culture of Macau is its greatest asset .
" Macau is so small .
It has no land for industry or agriculture .
All it has to rely on is intellect , " he says .
Three hundred years ago , missionaries in Macau built the first university in the Far East , the Jesuit College of St. Paul 's .
Since the 1980s , Macau has established six institutes of higher learning .
" Macau 's population is young , and the average educational level is quite high , " he notes .
Four hundred years of cultural intercourse between Occident and Orient has left behind enormous assets in Macau , and the enclave 's people have the ability to form a bridge of exchange between East and West .
Now that Macau 's sovereignty has switched hands , Marreiros has chosen not to return to his motherland of Portugal , but to remain behind .
" Macau is my home .
My heart is in Macau , " he says .
Marreiros is a person of Macau , part Portuguese and part Chinese .
A diversity of cultures will only enrich a person , not create a crisis of identity .
For Taiwanese people , who have questions about their own identity and often ask themselves who they are , what thoughts does Carlos Marreiros 's story bring to mind ?

New Rules for Tech Startups
-LRB- Cyril Chiang / graphics by Tsai Chih - pen / tr. by Jonathan Barnard -RRB-
In the past few years the Internet has helped to create a " new economy " that has both created technological fortunes and rewritten the postulates of traditional economic development .
Microsoft 's Bill Gates did n't make his money out of land or gold or oil , and he did n't make it from machines or factory goods .
Rather , what he had at his disposal was a method of organizing knowledge .
Precisely because entrepreneurs no longer need land or financial assets , the bar has never been lower for what is needed to build a successful company .
Yet it 's worth noting that the rate of success has also never been lower .
If you want to get investors to open their wallets in this new economic age , then you 've got to have a handle on some key points .
If investors ' eyes have n't brightened in three minutes , it 's all over .
Those hoping to build up a new company have got to know how to capture investors ' attention in the shortest possible time .
What is the right thing to say ?
How should you say it ?
The following 13 questions are what investors are most concerned about .
If you can focus on these 13 points of business startup logic and then add your own creative vision and arguments , then you 've probably taken your first step to success !
Question # 1 : How do you define your business ?
Successfully defining a business is a process of elimination .
In the late 1980s , Intel realized that it could no longer compete with Japanese semiconductor companies in the production of memory chips , so it left that market , believing that it would only be able to break free from Japanese competition by focusing on its specialty of microprocessors .
It is now a larger company many times over .
This is a story of how " loss " can turn into " gain . "
" Elimination " suggests paring down .
The more clearly a company is defined , the more limited will be its operational scope .
But just about any successful company has a clear sense of its limitations , because otherwise it would n't be able to differentiate itself in the marketplace and reduce its vulnerablility to price wars .
Consequently , it is essential to pay attention to the following points :
1. No matter how complex your company , it must have a basic conception that is clear and easy to understand .
2. The company 's definition is a reflection of its operational strategies .
3. An unclear company definition represents unclear operational strategies .
4. You 've got to clearly define your role based on the value of your products and services and get the consumer to understand what makes you better .
5. Differentiation is good and works to your advantage .
Question 2 : What is your executive summary ?
An executive summary serves as a preface to an investment or business plan .
It needs to faithfully reflect the special qualities and values of the entire plan in as few words as possible .
As far as investors are concerned , a clear , easy - to - read two - page summary is much better than a tedious 200 - page plan .
Steve Jurvetson , managing director of the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Draper , Fisher , and Jurvetson , says : " An executive summary is n't a financial contract ; it 's a story .
A story has to have drama and flesh - and - blood people .
For an executive summary , I 've never used Excel , and I 've never talked about models for the financial structure .
I always spend my time thinking about how big a story it could become . "
Therefore , you 've got to pay attention to the following :
1. The executive summary is the one chance you have to get investors interested in investing in your company .
2. Focus on selling your plan .
3. Get right to the point .
Do n't think of it as a literary competition .
4. In an orderly fashion , describe " the market , the management team , the finances and the technology . "
Question # 3 : What 's the justification for this business ?
The Japanese management guru Matsushita Konosuke has said , " Do n't sell customers things they find attractive , sell them things they find useful . "
Investors have a lot of different cards they can play , so they 've got to know why your business plan is worth pursuing .
Why now ?
Why you ?
Consequently , you must consider the following points :
1. Why should this be done ?
Why should you do it ?
Why now ?
2. The dollar sign -LRB- $ -RRB- is capitalism 's lingua franca .
3. The market will decide whether your plan is justifiable .
Question # 4 : How much risk are you willing to take on ?
Are you willing to risk failure ?
When you try to get people to invest in a new venture , there will invariably be one question that each and every one of those potential investors will have in mind :
" You want to put my money at risk , but what kind of risk are you taking ? "
Investors hope that the entrepreneur is taking equal risk , because only with commensurate risk will the two sides cooperate unselfishly .
Therefore , the entrepreneur must be very clear about the risk and the possibility of losing the investment .
What follows are the values of a Silicon Valley new - age knowledge - based business creator :
1. A failure is like the South in the American Civil War .
It 's history ; move on .
2. Those who have experience beat those who lack experience , and failure counts as experience .
3. Your past failure is your MBA from the school of hard knocks .
4. Failure is not rare or unusual .
You will only be successful by continuing to try .
You 've got to be careful about the following :
1. The investor and entrepreneur have to be taking similar risks if they are to cooperate selflessly .
2. Have you already put in time and money ?
3. Are you willing to forgo the security of a stable job and income ?
4. You can not pack a parachute and be thinking of a safe way to bail .
5. Having failed previously with startups does not mean a person is a loser .
Question # 5 : What are your company goals and business model ?
Morris Chang , chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor , believes that a company 's core staff ought to be on the same page .
They should share the same vision for the company and fit into its corporate culture .
The company goals should n't be pie - in - the - sky dreams .
Since the company has got to crystallize the investors ' and staff 's talents and energies , its vision for the future has to be attainable .
Apart from having a vision for the future , a company also needs a business model .
The business model is the way that the company plans to attain its goals .
A good business model can even realize visions of the future that seem impossible .
Priceline.com , the first American company to sell airline tickets directly over the Internet , surpassed the combined market capitalization of the three largest US airlines -LRB- United , American and Delta -RRB- after only two years of operations .
The three airlines have a total of 1,400 jets , whereas Priceline only has computers and network servers .
The key to its success was its business plan .
Therefore , you have to consider the following :
1. How do you outline where the company will be in three to five years ?
This is the company 's vision .
2. How do you realize the company 's vision ?
This is the business model .
3. The company 's vision is built on faith , and it requires the possibility of realization .
4. Once the company 's vision is defined , one should n't change it lightly .
The business model on the other hand can be constantly adapted in accordance with circumstances .
Question # 6 : How do you present your technology and service ?
Introducing the company 's technology to investors is something that the company founder should be very familiar with , but it is also is the source of conflicting feelings .
How should a founder of a start - up go about explaining its technology so that investors can understand it without getting so detailed as to reveal company secrets ?
Here are some recommendations :
1. You have to be able both to describe your innovation and protect your own intellectual property .
2. Do n't request a non-disclosure agreement , because this is unprofessional .
3. Investors are not intent on stealing your ideas .
Instead they want to see that you can justify them .
Question # 7 : What sort of problems do you want to solve ?
What problems is your company plan trying to solve ?
If you ca n't answer this clearly , then maybe you should be worrying about your future .
Taiwanese entrepreneurs are facing the problem of having an incomplete chain of value , which is a result of their customers handling the activities with the greatest added value .
This is a result of the problem , not its cause !
The real problem is that entrepreneurs in Taiwan do not make clear enough definitions when trying to resolve a problem , or they narrowly look at " manufacturing " as a way of solving the problem .
Raising one 's ability to innovate means raising one 's ability to solve problems .
This leads us to the following conclusions :
1. Finding a solution is finding a profitable market base .
2. You can only solve the problem by finding the problem .
3. Put your energies into solving today 's problems .
4. The problems created by your actions should not exceed the problems solved .
Question # 8 : Is the team complete ?
Who is missing ?
Founders of startups will always build their own management team , and they almost always start with people around them and then move on to attract personnel from outside .
This creates a blind spot in the structure , with like - minded people grouped together .
Investors like to hear entrepreneurs say that their teams are incomplete , because it shows that they have a practical mentality , and that they are aware of and willing to face their own shortcomings .
Good investors ought to maintain a mutually supportive relationship with the management team , but the investors are certainly not just the management team 's rubber stamp .
As a start - up founder , you ought to clearly understand that you are providing your knowledge and youth and the investors are providing their money .
The investors have no reason to want to handicap the entrepreneur .
In other words , there should be a supportive relationship between the investors and the management team , rather than an obstructive one .
We urge those who are creating a startup to understand where you come up short and be willing to ask for help .
Question # 9 : Where are your customers ?
How do you get hold of them ?
To answer this question , you 've got to focus on your " market segment . "
Secondly , you should analyze why customers in your market segment would like to do business with you .
You 've also got to consider how to prevent competitors from taking customers within the same market segment or how to effectively create entry barriers , so that you will be able to maintain a competitive advantage for as long as possible .
A price war is the simplest strategy , but consequently its effects are the most limited .
You should instead consider how to avoid the slippery slope of price wars .
What 's more , if you find that major changes in your sector are usually coming from other people 's customers , you should realize that they probably are n't your customers because they do n't need your products or can get something better .
To figure out why , you 've got to remind yourself to do the following :
1. Focus your attention on the market segment .
2. A good product or service will actively create a market segment and find customers that did n't previously exist .
3. Of course , any customer of yours sees some value in you .
How they value you determines their expectations of you .
4. Do n't forget about " non-customers . "
Do n't fall into the trap of thinking that you understand everything about the industry .
Question # 10 : Where are your competitors ?
Please do n't say that you have no competitors .
Perhaps you have no competitors today , but you will have them tomorrow .
And if you really do n't have weighty competitors , then your competitor is yourself .
Entry barriers and exit barriers have opposite effects .
The former determines if there will be a swarm of competitors .
-LRB- If entry barriers are low , anyone can compete . -RRB-
The latter determines whether there will be detrimental competition .
-LRB- If exit barriers are high , competitors will fight to the last penny . -RRB-
If you want to maintain core compet - itiveness , the first thing you 've got to do is to eliminate business that does not relate to your core competencies .
Furthermore , you should put the emphasis on innovation and strategic management .
Please remember :
1. When you analyze entry barriers , you should also analyze exit barriers .
2. You should focus on your " core competencies . "
3. You should use core personnel , develop core technology and attain core goals .
Question # 11 : What is your market share ?
In America telephones reached 90 % of households in 50 years , whereas it only took video recorders 18 years to do the same .
Today , new technological products and services are unlikely even to be around that long .
If technological entrepreneurs do not move forward , they fall behind .
Developing the company -LRB- and extremely fast at that -RRB- is a road that must be taken , and market share is an indication of the speed of the company 's development .
The " killer " strategy must combine " quickly changing the rules of the game " with management thinking that is characterized by a " willingness to take risks , " " unconventionality , " and " a determination to become the standard . "
Your determination as the founder of the company is all - important .
You 've got to pay attention to the following :
1. How should your company prepare to develop quickly ?
2. Not only must you advance technologically if you are not to fall behind , but you must also develop quickly .
3. There is a fine line between ambition and wishful thinking .
4. The underlying logic is more important than the results .
Question # 12 : When will you break even ?
How do you read financial clues ?
How do you transform your company ?
In the Internet economy , companies that are not among the leaders are going to have a rough go of it .
Therefore , merging -LRB- or being acquired -RRB- at the right price is more important than staying in business forever .
In order to prepare for a merger at any moment , financial officers must get used to the idea that " the company itself is its our biggest product . "
In the past , financial officers focused on cost management , cash flow , capital movement and risk avoidance .
From now on , looking at these wo n't be enough , and financial officers ought to turn their attention to mergers and raising capital .
If you want to raise capital , you 've got to explain how it is going to be used .
If you are going to pursue acquisitions , you have to evaluate assets .
Traditionally you raised capital in order to expand the scope of your business .
Internet companies , on the other hand , raise capital to increase the value of the company before acquiring or being acquired .
Value in the Internet economy is determined by the business model .
It is very possible that the a company will lack tangible assets upon which to evaluate worth .
As a result , " reading the value of the business plan " has to take the place of the traditional work of checking the books .
The value of the business model is in looking toward the future , not the present , and as a result most mergers take the form of stock swaps so as to preserve cash reserves .
In order to obtain the best rate of exchange , it is important to be traded on the market as soon as possible .
With this lack of clarity , " breaking even " becomes the ultimate financial indicator .
This series of changes has had a huge impact on financial officers .
The founder of a startup must :
1. Pay attention to cash and cash flow .
2. Forget about staying in business forever .
Be prepared at all times to sell the company for the highest profit .
Question # 13 : How should a startup entrepreneur handle communications and the media ?
Communication and media skills are certainly no less important than technology for a startup company .
The professional managers of listed companies frequently come face to face with non-professionals .
Speaking to the media is just one example .
With regard to communication and the media , the main things to do are to simplify and speak in language that your listeners will understand .
Excellent communicators first of all know how to " listen , " and secondly can think logically and learn quickly .
You 've got to take an open and objective attitude in order to understand the background of a question , and then respond by focusing on the questioner 's needs .
You must never force others to dance at your expert pace .
Do n't overestimate your listeners ' specialized knowledge , but do n't underestimate their general intelligence .
From the very beginning , founders of startups have got to get into the habit of :
1. Cultivating explanation skills , so that you can explain specialized knowledge to non-specialists and they can get the gist .
2. Practicing how best to communicate .
Citing a good example is usually the best way to explain something .
Guy Kawasaki , founder of Garage.com , the largest US company focusing on attracting venture capital for startups , has long been famous in Silicon Valley for his entrepreneurial enthusiasm .
In a speech he delivered in the US in May he outlined the main points in his vision of new - age entre - preneurialism :
In the 19th century , companies in the ice business would send people to frozen lakes or rivers to saw up the ice .
These companies were replaced by ice making factories .
Then refrigerators replaced ice factories .
If these businessmen had embraced change instead of resisting it , they would have had an opportunity to move into a new technological field - rather than just watching helplessly as others took over what was once their domain .
Change is the only constant on the way to success !
Minister of Transportation and Communications
Yeh Chu - lan

Raised in a Hakka village in Miaoli County , Yeh Chu - lan , a graduate of the law department at Fu - Jen Catholic University , is the new Minister of Transportation and Communications , overseeing 120,000 employees and an annual budget of over NT$ 400 billion .
From her early career in advertising , to taking up her late husband 's unfulfilled wishes and setting out on the road of political no - return , Yeh Chu - lan has fought impressively , earning wide acclaim .
What makes Yeh , having tasted the sweetness and sorrow of life in equal portions , able to switch roles with such aplomb ?
And where does the soft - spoken yet resolute Yeh find the strength to handle the mounting challenges that life has thrust upon her ?
If not for the self - immolation of her late husband , Cheng Nan - jung , Yeh would not have gotten involved in politics .
Since running for legislator in 1989 , Yeh Chu - lan 's approach to politics for over a decade has been to " do things for Taiwan . "
With the election of Chen Shui - bian to the presidency , she says she feels that the DPP 's transitional mission has been accomplished .
However , at the repeated invitation of both President Chen and Premier Tang Fei to " write history for Taiwanese democracy , " Yeh was moved by their sense of mission and accepted the appointment as new Minister of Transportation and Communications .
Delicate and soft on the outside , strong and tough on the inside , Yeh Chu - lan 's confidence and tenacity are well illustrated by her love story .
After commencing university at the age of 18 , she met fellow philosophy student Cheng Nan - jung .
Her family 's eldest girl , she disregarded her father 's objections and insisted on marrying Cheng .
For a short period after graduating from university she returned to teach in Miaoli , but in order to be together with Cheng Nan - jung she returned north to look for work in Taipei .
Starting in an advertising agency as an account assistant , she climbed straight up the ranks to become the highest - ranking female executive in Taiwan 's advertising industry , impressing colleagues with her competence and talents .
Far more than a pinch - hitter
From career woman to professional legislator , Yeh 's metamorphosis was clear for her colleagues to see .
In " Looking Back , " a documentary on women in Taiwanese politics that was filmed with support from the DPP 's Department of Women 's Affairs , the late DPP women 's affairs director Peng Wan - ju made an acute observation about Yeh :
Although it was her husband 's lingering shadow that took her into politics , Yeh 's performance has gone beyond the traditional experiences of women in opposition politics , transcending the image of a victimized family member to manifest the autonomy of a female political figure in her own right .
Peng commented : " During her first term as a legislator she acted a lot like a substitute , so every time she questioned officials or addressed a session she would say that such and such was communicated to her in a dream by Cheng Nan - jung .
However , by her second and third terms , she came very much into her own , and she won great respect from women 's groups as a defender of women 's interests and a champion of the family dependents ' section of the civil law . "
At the recent Yangmingshan seminar for new government officials , Yeh Chu - lan gave a short interview , stressing , " When I first ran for office I was not playing the role of a housewife pinch - hitting for her husband .
I was already an influential female executive in my professional field .
And even though I went into politics due to my husband 's sacrifice , I was only willing to do so because I shared his beliefs .
My objective was to fight as a mother for what I hold dearest .
As a public servant , I have always been my own person . "
In over a decade in politics , Yeh Chu - lan 's exhaustive efforts on the part of women 's groups are worth tallying .
The revision of the family dependents ' section of the civil law was a major undertaking , with a mind - boggling number of legal provisions touching on highly complex issues .
Long - term efforts by women 's groups , plus the personal crusades of Yeh and New Party legislator Hsieh Chi - ta , ultimately built momentum in the Legislative Yuan .
Finally , after exhaustive lobbying of the Executive Yuan , the Legislative Yuan passed the revision of certain provisions of the family dependents ' section of the civil law in 1996 , providing safeguards for Taiwanese women 's prenuptial property rights and child custody rights .
This proved to be the first major step for equal rights between the sexes under law .
Respect for expertise
Variously described by the media as a crusader for justice , a hard worker and an incorruptible political figure , Yeh Chu - lan , known as " mother of the country , " carries considerable seniority within the DPP .
Her aggressive efforts to shore up the Hakka vote for Chen Shui - bian during the presidential election were also crucial to her appointment as Minister of Transportation and Communications .
On the other hand , the media also notes that Yeh has practically no past connections to the Ministry of Transportation and Communications , and the ministry 's complex , specialized tasks present her with a steep learning curve .
Addressing these issues , Yeh relates , " The Ministry of Transportation and Communications , in a word , is about ' people , ' making it essentially a huge service network .
With this in mind , setting out from the standpoint of ' people ' is the first task I have set out for myself . "
In addition , she stresses that due to the excessive burdens of the old administration , in which policies were constantly distorted by personal interests and party considerations , perhaps professionals in the Ministry of Transportation and Communications were frustrated at being unable to put their expertise into play .
" People want the new government to quell the old never - ending conflicts over individual interests , and draw a line between public administration and politics .
These are the biggest issues faced by the new cabinet .
Now is the chance to clear out the cobwebs and get off to a new start . "
A Date with Destiny -- Presidential Candidates Woo the Voters
Four years ago , amidst the tense atmosphere of the first - ever direct elections for the nation 's leader in Chinese history , issues of ethnicity and ideology became focal points .
The crisis sparked by PRC missile tests pushed the security of Taiwan to the top of the issue list , and the ticket of Lee Teng - hui and Lien Chan of the ruling Kuomintang , which promised stability , won the election with 54 % of the vote .
In this year 's presidential election , cross-strait policy is still an important subject .
But none of the five candidates is advocating Taiwan independence , and , among the three main contenders , there is a race for the center .
All three have proposed ideas to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait :
Lien Chan has proposed a " Taiwan Strait zone of peace , " James Soong has advocated the signing of a peace treaty with the mainland , and Chen Shui - bian has announced that if elected he will not declare Taiwan independent nor seek to have the " two states formula " inserted in the constitution .
In 1996 , President Lee Teng - hui was far ahead of his rivals all the way , and the election was lopsided .
This year , the most prominent feature of the campaign is exactly the opposite :
The three main candidates are running neck - and - neck , and the election battle is fierce .
It is impossible right now to say who might win , and will probably remain so right up to the finish .
With all the candidates having largely similar views on cross-strait relations , what issues will be decisive ?
Candidates can play the stability card , the bull - market card , the serve - the - people card , the personal charisma card , and so on , but which one of these will prove to be the trump card ?
Taking advantage of the Chinese New Year , many Taiwan businessmen working in the PRC returned to Taiwan to spend the holiday with their families .
Just after the new year , the Mainland Affairs Council and several non-governmental groups co-sponsored a seminar on economic relations with mainland China .
They invited a number of Taiwan businessmen who were among the earliest to invest in the PRC to come to the seminar and relate their experiences .
At this event , there was virtually no mention of the election .
The participants were far more concerned about choosing investment sites , hiring mainland personnel , and understanding customs regulations .
You could privately ask them : Is there likely to be any change in the cross-strait situation after the election of a new leader ?
Will the election affect willingness to invest in the PRC ?
But you would only get responses like : " Let 's not talk politics , " or " Everyone is seeking stability , and there wo n't be much of a change . "
Most of the businessmen expressed optimism that after the entry of the PRC and Taiwan into the World Trade Organization later this year , relations between the two sides would steadily improve .
A terrifying topic ?
Maintaining peaceful relations across the Taiwan Strait is the common hope of the vast majority of the people of Taiwan .
When you talk about 21st century leadership in Taiwan , cross-strait policy is the most serious subject that politicians must face , because it involves the very survival of Taiwan .
" However , because this subject touches on the question of the ' loyalty ' of the candidates toward Taiwan , it has become a terrifying topic for them , " says Wang Chien - chuang , president of The Journalist magazine and a longtime observer of political development in Taiwan .
By looking at the carefully worded statements of the various candidates , he says , it is clear that they are all afraid of being accused of " selling out Taiwan . "
The only exception is the fringe candidate Li Ao , who is well - known for shooting from the hip .
Unafraid of criticism that he is " betraying Taiwan , " he has publicly endorsed the PRC 's policy of " one country , two systems . "
The other minor candidate , Hsu Hsin - liang , set the foundations for his mainland policy as early as ten years ago when he wrote a book on his theory of a " newly rising people . "
But neither of these views conform to mainstream values , and these candidates are getting little support .
What about the three main candidates ?
Chen Shui - bian of the Democratic Progressive Party , which advocates Taiwan independence , produced a long and detailed white paper on China policy , which offered some changes and reservations to the independence position .
But , in an unguarded moment , Chen also declared " Long live Taiwan 's independent sovereignty ! " and this comment has left many people uncertain which is the real Chen .
Independent candidate
James Soong has suggested defining Taiwan - PRC links as a " quasi-international relationship . "
This aims for a middle ground between the KMT 's " two states formula " and the PRC 's " one country , two systems " that will appeal to Taiwan , mainland China , and the international community .
But this idea has been criticized for unilaterally reducing Taiwan to the status of a " quasi-country , " thereby weakening Taiwan 's status and bargaining power vis - a - vis the mainland .
Lien Chan , candidate of the ruling KMT , is somewhat bound to support the government 's " two states formula . "
After much consideration , his mainland policy has been framed as working toward the middle stage of the National Reunification Guidelines - in other words , attempting to re-establish official channels of communication between the two sides of the strait .
" No one dares be different from the others on mainland policy , " says Wang Chien - chuang .
This is because over the past few years a consensus has taken shape in Taiwan society on policy toward mainland China : " Taiwan first . "
No one has the ability to alter this consensus .
The candidates can merely haggle over details of policy , such as differences over the scope or timing of liberalization of the " three direct links " -LRB- direct trade , direct transport , and direct mail -RRB- .
Alexander Lu , a professor of political science at National Taiwan University , agrees with the no - major - innovations approach of the three candidates .
As he sees it , since currently there are three candidates with a roughly equal share of the vote , whoever wins will probably not get more than 50 % .
As a result , there will be a great deal of countervailing pressure against radical change .
Concludes Lu : " Policy will tend to be centrist , and any steps taken will be small . "
He adds , " Taiwan is a pluralistic society , and if you want to attract many types of voters , you ca n't be too outspoken about policy .
This is because extreme clarity does n't make much difference to those who already support you , but it could cost you undecided votes . "
Local issues , national results
Mainland policy is a minefield , but it is the foundation for all other policies , and no candidate can ignore it .
However , this does not mean , say Wang and Lu , that it will be a decisive factor in the election .
" There is a very curious aspect to Taiwan 's electoral culture , " explains Wang .
Taiwan is small , and voters do not clearly distinguish between the roles of the head of state , elected legislators , and government bureaucrats .
No matter how high the office , for many voters , especially in traditional constituencies , " all politics is local . "
For them , what matters is whether a politician seems concerned about their hometown issues .
That is why when Chen Shui - bian went to Sanhsia in Taipei County , he talked about a pension for the elderly , and when Lien Chan went to Kaohsiung he talked about establishing a science - based industrial park there .
These parochial issues are the real keys to the election .
Next in importance is the candidate 's character , including charisma , leadership style , and attitude in dealing with incidents that come up during the campaign .
In this campaign , James Soong has been at the center of much controversy over the character issue .
The issues that surround him can be traced back to his more than two decades near the top in Taiwan political life .
Kuo Shu - min of the China Times Express , a longtime observer of the KMT , says that controversy over James Soong goes back to the days when the KMT ruled over Taiwan and repressed all opposition .
When Soong was KMT secretary - general , he was powerful and aloof ; the only way to get an interview with him was to block his car as it left party headquarters .
During the struggle in the KMT between the mainstream and the non-mainstream factions , Soong played a vital role in consolidating the position of President Lee Teng - hui .
In clearing out many obstacles on behalf of Lee , he incurred the wrath of many party elders , who considered him to be Lee 's " running dog . "
Soong is especially good at timing .
He knows what to say and when , in order to attract the most attention .
Kuo recalls several such opportune moments when Soong was provincial governor .
For example , he criticized the KMT center over the symbolic status assigned to the provincial governor at cabinet meetings , and also over unfairness in the division of government revenues .
His media skills were such that " he only had to open his mouth and he would be the headline on page one or two . "
Although opinions are divided about Soong , Kuo affirms one thing :
He has had to be very determined in order to transform his image from that of a skilled party infighter from a high - ranking family to that of a populist who understands the people .
Says Kuo , " If Lee Teng - hui is a Taiwanese opera performer , then James Soong is a Peking opera actor - Soong 's moves are refined down to the last detail . "
For example , when the KMT was trying to persuade elder National Assembly members to retire , Soong met with them all individually .
During his five years as governor , he visited each of the 309 towns and rural townships in Taiwan .
In this presidential election , at any event with a crowd , he wants to shake the hand of everyone there ; he believes that he can tell from the handshake alone whether he has that person 's vote .
Gold cup and plain water
In contrast to Soong and Chen Shui - bian , who have been through previous election battles and have distinct public identities , " Lien Chan is n't really a man of the people .
He does n't like to have the spotlight on him , he does n't think of himself as a star , and he does n't want to put on a show . "
But , says Wang Chien - chuang , it is debatable whether a politician really needs to have the common touch .
Compare Taiwan to the US .
Lee Teng - hui is similar to Bill Clinton , who has a personal charisma that moves people .
Lien Chan , on the other hand , is more like Al Gore , and has always been somewhat aloof from average citizens .
Says Wang Chien - chuang , " Lien Chan is like plain water in a gold cup . "
He 's been in government for more than 20 years , serving as minister of transportation and communications , foreign minister , Taiwan provincial governor , premier , and vice president .
" Yet still most citizens do not have a very strong impression of him .
This is really a strange situation . "
Chen Feng - hsin , a reporter for the United Daily News , writes in the authorized biography 100 % Lien Chan that a large part of the reason Lien appears to be unapproachable is because of the way he has come across on TV .
Lien himself says that , after more than 20 years in appointive positions , he has developed a stern mien .
Moreover , his appearances on television have often been at confrontational interpellation sessions in front of the legislature or the provincial assembly , so that his warmer side does not come across .
A little story in the book relates something of his sense of humor .
Lien was born in Xi'an in mainland China , and his first primary school was called the Zuo Xiu school .
Because of the war , he transferred out after only one year .
The name of the school actually was an abbreviation for a term meaning " to educate and cultivate . "
But in contemporary Taiwan , coincidentally , the characters zuo xiu mean " to put on a show " or " market yourself . "
Lien often jests , " It 's because I never graduated from ' Make a Show ' primary school that I 'm in the spot I 'm in today . "
Political writer Hsia Chen says that when Lien was foreign minister , he laid the foundations of pragmatic diplomacy , and allowed Kuo Wan - jung to attend the Asian Development Bank annual conference in Beijing .
After Lee Teng - hui came to power , Lee went through a series of battles with successive premiers :
Lien is the only one who has had a harmonious working relationship with the president .
Hsia says that Lien 's political character tends to be easy - going and generous , he can comfortably delegate authority , and he is calm under pressure .
Local boy makes good
Compared to Lien Chan , who comes from a wealthy family , Chen Shui - bian , who is an entirely self - made man , makes a marked contrast .
After starting his career as a lawyer , Chen acted as defense counsel for arrested opposition leaders , and then served several terms as a legislator , making a name for himself as a standout leader of the opposition .
He won the mayorship of the capital city of Taipei back in 1994 , and , step by step , has become the most popular figure in the DPP .
As a legislator , Chen was a sharp questioner of government officials , but he had a little trouble adjusting to being an executive official himself .
As Taipei mayor , his decisiveness won many plaudits , but his manner was often perceived as overbearing and this led to frozen relations with the city council .
" Chen fulfilled most of the promises he made in his campaign , but he did n't give much attention to procedural concerns , " says Wang Chien - chuang .
For example , he adopted a curfew for young people virtually unilaterally .
As Wang puts it : " Perhaps Chen would say that many problems in Taipei had reached a point calling for decisive action , but whether efficiency is more important than consultation is an eternally debatable question . "
A group of 33 education reform advocacy organizations rated the five candidates on their views on education reform .
On the question , " Does the candidate have a grasp of the key problems in education reform in Taiwan ? "
Chen and Hsu Hsin - liang were given top marks .
" Chen dares to talk about the cost of reform , " says Ting Chih - jen , director of one of these education reform groups .
Everybody knows the education system must be reformed , but reform costs money .
" Chen Shui - bian dares to talk about the problem of paying the bill . "
However , though Chen says he will ask the legislature to guarantee the necessary financing , he does not , as Hsu Hsin - liang does , guarantee that he will spend 6 % of GDP on education .
" He 's not clear enough , " says Ting , who opines that Chen thinks that he can wait until he 's elected before he decides how much money to spend .
Overall , " Chen is good at finding the weaknesses in others ' policies , but not as good at facing up to questions when he is in power .
It may be easy to become the emperor , but to win the people 's hearts requires concrete action . "
Pork barrel politics
As for James Soong , " His policies are more for helping the weak , and give more thought to the poor . "
Soong has taken into account the long - existing disparity between state - funded and private secondary schools in Taiwan -LRB- private schools are much more expensive , though they merely provide the same education as the state schools -RRB- .
His platform includes subsidies to assist the children of low - income families who attend private secondary schools .
Ting admits that in evaluating education platforms , the incumbent , Lien Chan , is at a relative disadvantage , because the policies currently being implemented are open to immediate scrutiny .
According to Ting , " Lien Chan has been at odds with the education community for a long time . "
Reformers are most disappointed that the education budget has been seriously squeezed these past few years , falling by as much as NT$ 40 billion in a single year .
" Lien is also the candidate who is most likely to believe that problems can be solved by throwing money at them , " says Ting .
Lien has stated that he wants to extend compulsory education from 9 to 12 years , and to offer vouchers for pre-school and private secondary education .
These would all place tremendous strain on the already overstretched education budget .
The government debt is currently NT$ 2.6 trillion , ten times higher than a decade ago ; if these promised education " checks " were actually cashed , the debt would pass NT$ 3 trillion .
Ting concludes : " He has lost his direction in terms of education policy , and he underestimates the education community .
He thinks he just has to promise to throw money around and then he 'll have people persuaded . "
Educators are not looking to be a burden on the country ; all they want is that the government stop squeezing the existing budget smaller and smaller .
In fact , the " checks " candidates write are closely connected to their assumptions about the roles governments should play .
" Just as wool grows on a sheep , if the government role expands , it will require ever greater resources , " says Wu Hui - lin , a researcher at the Chung Hua Institution for Economic Research .
As an economist , Wu advocates the free market and thinks that the government 's effectiveness should not be overrated .
For example , large - scale government encouragement of high - tech industry has contributed to an imbalance in the industrial structure .
The stock market is an even more obvious example :
From the Securities and Exchange Commission to the Ministry of Finance to the proposed Stock Stabilization Fund , you can see the government 's shadow everywhere .
" The government should go back to just playing a referee role , and do that well , " Wu avers .
This applies to economic relations with the PRC as well , Because wherever there are controls there will be speculation
This applies to economic relations with the PRC as well .
Laws ca n't cover everything , and always leave gray areas , so that " influential persons are positioned to undertake quasi-legal activities with impunity .
The government should not be creating special opportunities for the private profit of certain individuals . "
Wu believes the market should be left to itself .
Improvement , not change
However , others have the opposite view .
Some believe that Taiwan 's market is too affected by non-economic factors , so the government must play a protective role .
There has long been debate in Taiwan over the relative importance of the market and government intervention .
But it can not be overlooked that one major reason Taiwan is now the world 's 12th largest trading nation is because government policy has fostered economic prosperity .
J.T. Day , chairman of the National Association of Small and Medium Enterprises of the ROC , avers , " Taiwan needs to improve , but does not need to change . "
Democratic reform in Taiwan in recent years has come about without the shedding of a single drop of blood ; this is an amazing accomplishment .
" Our house is already built .
Perhaps it is not perfect , and needs some renovation , but is it really necessary to tear it down and start again ? "
Ten years ago , the total annual value of Taiwan 's imports and exports was NT$ 50 billion .
Today that figure is NT$ 200 billion , a four-fold increase .
Day asks : " If Taiwan were not a good business environment , why would big corporations bring their second generation back from abroad to take over ?
In this era of globalization , they could simply let their children stay overseas ! "
He argues that Taiwan was the country least affected by the Asian financial crisis because the government handled the situation well .
He gives the government 's economic cabinet a grade of 98 .
He is worried that if someone other than the ruling party candidate wins the election , the new economic officials might not be as capable .
Governing is different
Wang Chien - chuang states : " All candidates have beautiful - sounding platforms , because this is a presidential election , and they must have a blueprint for governing the nation .
But running for office and running the country are two very different things . "
It has been said , " campaigning is like poetry , governing is like an essay . "
In writing a poem , one can create a coherent and highly refined work .
But it is only actual governing that tests one 's true staying power .
Scholars have stated that the 2000 election in Taiwan has three special characteristics :
For one thing , this is the first time the opposition has a very real possibility of taking the reins of government .
Secondly , the three leading candidates are so close it is impossible to tell who will win .
And third , whatever the outcome , this is the beginning of Taiwan 's post-strongman era .
In this new era , says Wang , new standards for leadership are needed .
The national leader must be more than just a local politico writ large .
Wang gives his personal analysis of the pros and cons for the three candidates :
Chen Shui - bian is the person who brings the most hope and vitality , because his policies would be clearly different from those of the KMT .
But his biggest problem is " instability " - not personal instability , but policy instability .
For example , sometimes he seems opposed to allowing PRC firms to invest in Taiwan , sometimes in favor ; sometimes he seems against the opening of direct links with the mainland , sometimes not .
James Soong is very capable , but his very success may be his weak point .
He is often very proud of himself because his provincial administration built a bridge or aqueduct to meet the needs of ordinary people .
But , ancient Chinese governing wisdom criticizes those who " accomplish a small feat and think they can do anything , or discover a trivial idea and think they are brilliant . "
Lien Chan offers stability above all .
But he carries a heavy burden .
Lien must face up to the fact that his party has been governing in Taiwan for 50 years , and people want change .
Even if he wins , this may mean only that the people of Taiwan are willing to give Lien Chan a chance , and would not necessarily be an endorsement of the KMT itself .
Peace as a weapon
What kinds of challenges face the next leader of Taiwan ?
Public opinion surveys show that voters are most concerned about crime and the economy .
In a February survey conducted by the United Daily News , the number of citizens very concerned about crime was 31 % , eleven percentage points higher than four years ago .
Roughly the same percentage said they were most concerned about problems of finance and the economy .
Early this year Commonwealth magazine asked citizens , " What do you think is the first thing the new president should do after taking office ? "
The results show that the people of Taiwan believe that the most urgent problems are crime , " black gold politics " -LRB- the confluence of organized crime , moneyed interests , and corrupt politicians -RRB- , and raising economic competitiveness .
Senior journalist Chu Sung - chiu says that all three major candidates say they are opposed to black gold politics .
But citizens want more than slogans , they want effective action .
Political scientist Alexander Lu says that the crux of the issue is resoluteness .
If the resolve was there , it would not be that difficult to reduce crime and corruption .
Ting Chih - jen says , " Crime is rising fastest among youth . "
He argues that education is in fact the best crime - fighting policy :
" If students can enjoy a happy learning environment at school , then society will no longer be sitting on a powderkeg . "
Ting says that , although education is not a panacea , it is certainly not irrelevant .
Unfortunately , the effects of education policy are visible only in the long term , and it therefore has a relatively weak position in politics and is often neglected because policymakers probably will not see the fruits of their efforts in their terms of office .
But the main industries of the 21st century , such as the information and telecommunications industries , are knowledge - based .
If education is done well , the benefits will spread to many other areas .
The greatest variable for Taiwan society remains the other side of the Taiwan Strait .
" In the past two years , Taiwan has been continually testing where mainland China will draw the line in cross-strait relations , " says social critic Nan Fang Shuo .
But playing word games over how to define the relationship is simply a way of hiding from the problem , ostrich - like , as the situation deteriorates .
Fortunately the three main candidates have committed themselves to a moderate path .
Right now there 's a choice between peace and war in cross-strait relations .
The most important challenge for Taiwan now is to transcend the old mentalities of cold war anti-communism and Taiwan independence , and to build a new logic of peace .
Taiwan 's future is now in the hands of its voters .
Cracking Down on Black Gold
-LRB- Teng Sue - fen / tr. by Christopher MacDonald -RRB-
At the end of December there was an - other piece of good news concerning the new government 's crackdown on crime .
Fugitive Huang Wen - chung , wanted for complicity in the slaying of former Kaohsiung County Council speaker Wu Ho - sung , was arrested in Phuket after a two - year investigation and with the cooperation of the Thai police authorities .
And a month earlier the Executive Yuan handed the legislature a draft amendment to the Election and Recall Law that is designed to block mob - affiliated individuals from running for public office .
It is hoped that the combination of executive and legislative measures will finally drive " black gold " out of Taiwanese politics .
Cracking down on crime and stamping out " black gold " politics remains a central plank of the new government 's platform .
On December 15 the Ministry of Justice released the results of the first six months of its campaign against black gold -LRB- i.e. collusion among politicians , crime syndicates and big business -RRB- .
In the period up to December 10 , prosecutors around Taiwan dealt with more than 2,000 cases concerning black - gold offenses , brought charges against 30 elected officials and representatives , and found over NT$ 2.59 billion in misappropriated public funds .
The following cases , currently under investigation , have attracted particular attention : the alleged involvement of Linkou mayor Tsai Tzung - yi , Yingko Township chief Hsu Yuan - ho and Linkou council deputy chairman Chou Yeh - feng in the operation of an illegal waste dump at a disused brickyard ; alleged fraud by Nantou County commissioner Peng Pai - hsien in connection with construction projects ; allegations of corruption against Hsinchu mayor Tsai Jen - chien ; and the suspected embezzlement of post-921 earthquake relief funds by Hsinchu municipal council speaker Cheng Cheng - kuang .
Cases in which charges have already been brought include : the alleged misuse of public funds for overseas trips by Miaoli County commissioner Fu Hsueh - peng , along with county councilors Lo Hsing - chun and Hsieh Ching - chuan ; alleged breaches of the Securities Transaction Law by leading brokerage owner You Hwai - yin ; alleged financial fraud by national legislator Lin Jui - tu ; and alleged corruption by Tainan mayor George Chang in connection with a canal dredging project .
On December 6 the Executive Yuan passed a draft amendment to the Public Officials Election and Recall Law , tightening the criteria for those seeking public office so as to prevent mob affiliates from securing legal immunity as elected representatives .
Under the new provisions , anyone convicted and sentenced to jail under the Organized Crime Statute is barred for life from seeking election to an official post , while those indicted for a capital offence or for crimes carrying sentences of ten years or more are barred pending the verdict of the court .
Political parties become liable for the records of their candidates and face fines of NT$ 500,000 to NT$ 5 million if they nominate candidates who have prior convictions for electoral fraud or election violence .
These revisions to the law will immediately affect a number of parliamentary incumbents , including legislators Kuo Ting - tsai and Wu Tze - yuan , both of whom face disqualification from re-election .
The new provisions have received cross-party support in the legislature , though some deputies want further consultation concerning the exclusion from elections of those charged with but not yet convicted of the relevant offences , as this may deprive them unfairly of their rights .
Ho Chih - hui , secretary - general of the KMT caucus in the legislature , says that the party supports barring those convicted of involvement in organized crime from public office , but feels that the Executive Yuan needs to clarify just what " involvement " constitutes in this context .
Also , at the end of December and after much consultation within the opposition alliance , a preliminary agreement was reached on the draft amendment to the Farmers ' and Fishermen 's Associations Law , which has been under lengthy review in the legislature .
According to the agreement , restrictions on those seeking association membership and sub-committee posts will be relaxed , but the rules will be tightened for those running for the posts of director or general secretary , excluding or removing from office anyone who is in default for more than a year on loans from these and other such financial organizations .
However , the amendment remains stuck in the legislative queue for the time being .
In addition to the Ministry of Justice , the Criminal Investigation Bureau has also scored some successes in the past few months in its campaign against crime syndicates .
In early November the leader of the Four Seas Gang , Yang Kuang - nan , who had been arrested in Shanghai by mainland authorities , was transferred to Taiwanese custody in the transit lounge at Macau Airport and brought back to Taiwan for questioning .
Yang had fled to the mainland in November 1997 , after a warrant was issued for his arrest in connection with a loan - shark operation , and has been a key target for the police ever since .
Good news has also been coming in from local prosecutors ' offices around Taiwan .
Prosecutors in Taitung have been investigating county councilors for alleged corruption involving public grants and construction projects , and after half a year of the investigation 19 representatives have been indicted , including the current speaker and deputy speaker of the county council , along with 41 members of the previous two sessions of the council .
This sets a judicial record for the number of elected representatives facing charges in a single case .
Meanwhile , prosecutors in Changhua have been investigating electoral fraud from the time of the presidential election , and are seeking sentences of two months to three years for over 200 people , including the head of Yuanlin Township , for breaking the Election and Recall Law .
The Ministry of Justice has achieved a measure of success so far in its crackdown on black gold , but in order to win public support it has had to stress to investigators the need to observe due process and respect suspects ' rights .
The ministry has also required prosecutors to use discretion when collecting evidence about suspected financial impropriety by officials - for which there is a low rate of conviction - so as not to obstruct the work of civil servants or damage their morale .
New - found Fame : Three Cyber-authors Dealing with Success
-LRB- Eric Lin / photo courtesy of Red Ink Publishing / tr. by Christopher MacDonald -RRB-
Cyber-literature has become a publishing phenomenon , with teenage readers idolizing its star authors : writers such as Tsai Chih - heng - who set the ball rolling with his first cyber-novel and is known online as " Slicker Tsai " - along with Chi Chi , and Shuang - tzu .
How do these authors , whose literary apprenticeship has differed so much from that of other , more traditional authors , view the business of writing ?
" Dunno , " is what cyber-authors mostly reply when asked why their works have generated so much interest both in cyberspace and in the conventional publishing trade .
Tsai Chih - heng , whose online work The First Intimate Contact became a bookstore bestseller , elaborates a little : " It 's probably just the luck of the draw . "
Tsai released The First Intimate Contact on the web in 1998 , while reading for his doctorate at National Cheng Kung University 's Department of Hydraulics and Ocean Engineering .
He began by posting the story - based on his own love - life - in installments on a BBS , as a distraction from the pressure of writing his thesis .
" The First Intimate Contact was my first novel , " says Tsai .
" I had posted a few smaller pieces on the web before , in a similar vein , but with my scientific background I never considered myself literary material .
All I was trying to do was write down my own story in novel form . "
Tsai 's approach is to write about personal experience , with a touch of imagination thrown in .
" At first I had no intention of finishing the thing , " says Tsai candidly .
" But after a few installments the readers wanted more , and there was pressure to continue .
Eventually I put aside my doctoral thesis for a month or so and drilled off the rest of the novel . "
Tsai acknowledges that because of the immediacy of the medium his online work is to some degree influenced , in terms of form , content and progress , by the response of the readers - " even if a lot of that influence is unconscious . "
The author of Sunny Doll , Chi Chi , has a similar experience .
" Sunny Doll was surprisingly popular after just a few postings , and the enthusiastic response from readers made me anxious to finish the story as soon as possible .
This probably explains the rather slapdash ending , " says Chi Chi .
Of course there are also those like Shuang - tzu , author of Worn - Out Socks , who remain unfazed by readers ' reactions .
In Shuang - tzu 's case , this reflects her experience as the administrator of a BBS site .
" The administrator is an impartial observer who does n't get involved in the online discussion , so I learned not to be easily swayed by what is being said , " says Shuang - tzu .
As she points out , however , online stories are often posted several at a time , or abandoned half way through when their authors find themselves too busy for writing .
" It took only a month and a half to write Worn - Out Socks , but before that I spent a year and a half on another novel , Departed Soul , " says Shuang - tzu .
For her , the biggest source of pressure as a writer is the obligation to " finish . "
In order to reduce this pressure she starts with a disclaimer :
" Do n't ask me how it 's progressing .
If you do n't see any more installments then maybe there wo n't be any more . "
Most cyber-authors are used to writing directly online , which inevitably makes for some clunky sentences and continuity breaks .
Revisions are always needed before online works can be turned into real books , but the writers are still happy writing the way they do at present .
" I wo n't change the way I release my work , " says Chi Chi , " because it was the web environment that got me writing in the first place . "
Tsai Chih - heng and Shuang - tzu feel the same way .
So far , the critical reception for cyber-literature in book form has not been great , as Tsai Chih - heng and Chi Chi both bear in mind .
Says Tsai : " The success is just a matter of good luck .
I 'll still do what I originally wanted to do - teach at university - and I 'll write as much as I feel I need to . "
On the other hand , Shuang - tzu , who graduated in Chinese literature from Hua Fan University , does have literary ambitions .
" I do n't want to categorize my own works , just so long as they are ' understandable . '
I 'm interested in writing bona fide literature , but writing is n't going to be my main profession because I know that economic pressures can get in the way of natural creativity . "
In cyber-literature , casual writing , endless dialogue and wacky goings - on are the norm .
If someone writes it , someone else will read it .
As to the literary merits of the form and whether it will determine the course for literature in the coming century , that 's not something that unduly concerns the cyber-authors .
As Tsai Chih - heng , Chi - chi and Shuang - tzu all agree , regardless of fame , they themselves are still free spirits in cyberspace .
Internet Pioneer Heidi Hsueh
When the Internet started to take off in Taiwan in 1995 , Inforian was one of the first Taiwan Internet startups .
In the years since it has made quite a splash in the industry .
Back when the Internet in Taiwan mainly meant college students posting on bulletin boards and fooling around with Mosaic , a 23 - year - old graduate student at National Chengchi University named Heidi Hsueh and a graduate student at National Taiwan University named Lawrence Ho decided to form an Internet company together .
They started with just NT$ 500,000 .
Hsueh , who speaks with all the self - confidence of a prophet , recalls that she could early on see the tremendous impact that the Internet was going to have on people s lives .
" We were riding that first wave , " says Hsueh , who points out that deciding to strike at the right time is the first step to success .
Starting with books
In the early period , Inforian - or pAsia as it is known today - made money by publishing books and by localizing software for the Taiwan market .
Hsueh , the co-founder and executive vice president , ca n't count how many times she stayed up all night at the office in those early days .
Once , when their distributor for some reason refused to make payments , they had to endure two months without any incoming revenue .
" When you 're considering founding a company , " she says , issuing a warning to the many youths throwing themselves into Internet startups , " you 've really got to consider carefully the pressures you 're going to be under . "
The division of labor was clear from the start .
Ho was responsible for product design , and Hsueh handled business development and marketing strategy .
After two years , the company had its first success : the IQ97 -LRB- Inforian Quest -RRB- meta - search engine .
It hit a homerun for their Internet dreams .
Not long after Ho finished IQ97 , Hsueh sent it to the American website ZDNet , which awarded it five stars , its highest rating .
Hsueh then used the Internet to find distributors around the world .
Soon IQ97 had been translated into seven languages and plans were laid to step into the global market .
Within a year of the product 's release in October of 1997 , it had sold three million copies worldwide .
Inforian followed by launching CICQ , a Chinese language instant messaging site that attracted 1 million members from around the world .
Then in 1998 it focused on e-commerce , establishing the online auction site CoolBid , which has averaged quarterly sales of NT$ 60 million and has as many as 100,000 members .
Hsueh also made plans to forge alliances with world - famous companies .
In 1998 , after seeing Hsueh 's strategic alliance plan , Intel joined Inforian as a strategic partner .
Later , it decided to take a stake in the company .
It was the first time Intel had ever invested in an Asian Internet company .
Inforian , or pAsia as it is now known , has grown from four employees to a staff of several hundred , and has become a multinational with offices in the United States and on the mainland , as well as in Taiwan .
The Internet lifestyle
" At pAsia we emphasize that the Internet is a kind of technological art that allows people to improve their lifestyle , " Hsueh says .
" This is a work of art that requires creativity to be whole .
The Internet is part software , part media , part databank , and part communications device .
It 's the best possible space for making the most out of creativity .
" On the front door to the company 's office on Hsinyi Road , Leonardo DaVinci , Albert Einstein and the pAsia logo grace each other with their respective presences .
Hsueh notes that those two historical figures ' hard work and creativity changed the way people live .
This is also the spirit that pAsia wishes to project .
As far as Hsueh is concerned , the Internet is both a tool and a communications platform .
Internet companies , she believes , should reflect that .
As one such company , pAsia must be flexible , efficient and practice what it preaches .
The intranet at pAsia , for instance , provides chatrooms , vacation request forms , work guidelines , business travel forms , and even a bulletin board for selling workers ' second - hand stuff .
The offices have neon decorations on the walls and a hallway that is no less stylish than a haute couture catwalk .
The whole office is infused with a modern and technological sensibility .
Of course , success is never guaranteed .
American Tech stocks took a tumble in April of this year , and people began to talk about an Internet bubble .
Meanwhile , pAsia has had trouble obtaining new financing and has seen rapid turnover in its executive ranks , while rumors have circulated about its IPO application being rejected .
Nevertheless , Hsueh holds that pAsia has a clear niche and is very adaptable , so that it will be relatively unaffected by the economic downturn .
When you see Heidi Hsueh 's fresh young face and her no - nonsense approach to doing business , you quickly understand how members of the young generation are realizing their revolutionary ideas about lifestyle and career through the Internet .
Last - Minute Legislative Binge Opens New Era for Defense , Finance , and Human
-LRB- Jackie Chen / tr. by Phil Newell -RRB-
Rights
The second session of the Fourth Leg - islative Yuan ended on January 15th .
After government and opposition legislators burned the midnight oil for a whole week , 113 bills were passed .
Quantitatively , this was the most bills passed in a single session since 1948 .
But from the qualitative standpoint , there are many problems .
In addition , the session saw a public scandal in which legislators have been suspected of using back - door channels to get state - run financial institutions to invest in private venture capital companies .
Also , with the presidential elections fast approaching , many laws appeared intended to benefit a certain candidate .
Controversial legislation included :
1 .
Regulations governing the distribution of expense account money to local elected representatives and village and neighborhood chiefs : These regulations greatly increase payments made to local executive and assembly officials .
With the passage of this law , the budget for these expenses should be forced up from the current NT$ 4.4 billion to more than NT$ 7 billion .
Besides being seen as a blatant handout to influence the presidential election , and a contradiction of government promises to eliminate the positions of these local officials -LRB- who are big players in political patronage networks -RRB- , the law also brought criticism from Taipei and Kaohsiung city councillors , whose salaries are cut by the bill .
However , Minister of the Interior Huang Chu - wen insists that city councillors were amply consulted during the drafting process .
2 .
The law to encourage private - sector participation in public infrastructure projects : This law stipulates that the private sector may undertake BOT projects -LRB- build , operate , and transfer to the government -RRB- for major public infrastructure , including development of new towns , major industrial enterprises , and high - tech facilities .
Besides offering tax incentives , the new law will assist private investors to get beyond the limits of current law and invest in new land .
Indeed , it will even enable private investors to undertake compulsory land purchasing using government authority .
Also , companies involved in major transportation infrastructure will be allowed to issue new stock or corporate debt to raise funds .
This law should have a positive effect for current BOT projects which are facing obstacles , including the high - speed railway and the proposed rapid transit line to CKS International Airport .
There will now be a legal basis for the high - speed railway to raise more capital .
Also , now that the regulations for establishing new towns have been revised , the proposed plan to build a mass transit line to the airport by the Chang Yi financial group can become reality .
However , some scholars have criticized this law for being poorly formulated and open to abuse .
Yang Chung - hsin , a researcher in the Institute of Economics at the Academia Sinica , says that to give financial groups and business operators the same powers as the government to requisition land can only be done if equal attention is given to fairness and efficiency ; otherwise , the interests of landowners will clash , and there will be endless disputes .
3 .
Regulations on a national financial stabilization fund : This law will empower the government to intervene to protect the stock market .
In the event of " threats to national stability " - such as major internal or external events , rapid movements of international capital - the government will be able to draw on an NT$ 500 billion fund .
This law has been criticized by academics as a serious distortion of the market mechanism , as putting the policy makers into the position of being market players , and as inevitably creating opportunities for insider trading and the manipulation of the market to the benefit of a privileged few .
But President Lee Teng - hui and members of the Cabinet have argued that Taiwan 's stock market is too vulnerable to cross-strait developments , and this law will enable the government to stabilize the market - and thus domestic morale - in the event of crises like the 1996 PRC missile tests .
4 .
The National Defense Law and the organic law of the Ministry of Defense : The NDL will unify the administrative channel -LRB- previously handled by the Ministry of Defense -RRB- and the war - fighting chain of command -LRB- previously under the virtually autonomous general staff -RRB- .
Now the general staff will be clearly placed under the minister of defense , who will be a civilian .
These changes mark a new era in ROC military modernization .
The " organic law " will , among other changes , cause individual services to lose their respective intelligence agencies , which will be unified under the general staff .
The political warfare system -LRB- an autonomous system of political commissar - type officers , created in early Republican times , to ensure the loyalty of the military to the nationalist revolution 's leaders -RRB- will be reorganized and its functions will undergo a qualitative change .
Though it remains to be seen if the political warfare system will retain its own officer corps and academy separate from the regular armed forces , Minister of Defense Tang Fei says that the ultimate goal is to unify all the officer corps .
5 .
The coastal defense law and the organic law of the Coast Guard Command : This will establish the Coast Guard as a ministerial level body , responsible for coastal defense and for combating smuggling and illegal immigration .
Some say that this does not conform to the ideal of streamlining the government , and also say that it is very unusual to bring a front - line law enforcement agency into the cabinet .
Also , the idea that the 22,000 - man Coast Guard will be represented in the cabinet , while the 70,000 - plus - man police force remains sub-ministerial , rankles among some police officers .
However , the Executive Yuan argues that Taiwan 's coastal policing work also touches on national defense and sovereignty questions -LRB- with regard to the Tiaoyutai or Spratly Islands , for example -RRB- .
A single unified body with sufficient rank is necessary to integrate these functions with coastal and shoreline law enforcement and fishing harbor inspections .
6 .
Regulations governing reconstruction in the wake of the September 21 earthquake : This law will govern reconstruction after the expiration of the original emergency decree .
It calls on the Executive Yuan to create a community reconstruction fund for damaged areas .
Urban renewal laws have been relaxed to offer incentives for people to rebuild .
The legislation also arranges for children under 18 orphaned by the quake to receive a government - subsidized trust fund to pay for their living expenses and education .

Constitutional Revision Paves Way for Phasing Out National Assembly
-LRB- Chang Ching - ju / tr. by David J.
Toman -RRB-
On April 24 the National Assembly finalized the chief task of the sixth round of constitutional revisions during Lee Teng - hui 's presidency : its own demobilization .
While this development will allay popular fears of an everlasting National Assembly , how to formulate comprehensive measures to fill in the constitutional and functional void of the moribund body becomes the next vital task .
On March 24 , just days after the ROC presidential election , the Council of Grand Justices made a constitutional interpretation of last year 's National Assembly term extension , declaring the move null and void .
This stirred the ire of National Assembly members , who struck back during the ensuing constitutional revision session , claiming that " lifelong privileges for grand justices violate the constitution . "
The reaction by a minority of NA delegates to the grand justices ' constitutional interpretation once again triggered displeasure in society at the body 's refusal to admit its fallibility .
Activists in groups such as the Taipei Society and the Association of Taiwanese University Professors organized a street demonstration to call for the dissolution of the National Assembly .
A further consequence of the grand justices ' ruling was that an election would have to be held to produce a new National Assembly membership before the conclusion of the current term .
While this development had would - be candidates in all parties scrambling to launch election campaigns , by late March the post-presidential-election situation , combined with pressure from public opinion , pushed the KMT to work with the DPP on means to phase out the National Assembly , despite the KMT 's previous opposition to the body 's complete dissolution in the name of preserving the constitutional structure .
For a time , the question of whether to hold elections for the National Assembly , as well as the DPP and KMT 's shared policy for phasing out the body , were viewed as motivated by fear of the growth of the People First Party -LRB- PFP -RRB- .
Thus the hubbub continued over the fate of the National Assembly for a fortnight , until finally the newly formed PFP caucus in the assembly agreed to its gradual downsizing .
This paved the way for the commencement on April 8 of the sixth round of constitutional revisions in recent years , in which such issues as reducing the total number of NA delegates and freezing their powers and duties - amounting to their " self - abolition " - became the center of discussion .
The various parties leveraged their carrots and sticks against their delegates , threatening expulsion for not supporting the neutralization of the National Assembly at the same time as they tried to appease their delegates .
Finally , on April 24 these maneuvers helped bring about the passage of several constitutional revisions , including deactivation of the National Assembly , favorable provisions for residents of Taiwan 's offshore islands -LRB- Kinmen , Matsu , and Penghu -RRB- and military personnel , and revocation of lifelong special privileges for grand justices .
In line with these revisions , the voting public will no longer directly elect NA delegates .
Rather , the National Assembly will become a " task - based body " generated according to proportional political party representation in the legislature , maintaining the rights to ratification of constitutional revisions proposed by the Legislative Yuan , impeachment of the president and vice president , and resolutions on modifications to national territory .
With these changes , legislators will exercise approval over personnel appointments to the Judicial , Examination and Control yuans .
To be fair , the National Assembly does have its unique set of duties and powers under the existing structure , thus few people are ready to call for its complete abolition .
This is especially notable given the ambiguity of Taiwan 's constitutional structure , seeing as it is not a presidential system , a cabinet system , or a two - headed system in the true sense .
Many scholars caution that eliminating the National Assembly and handing all its powers to the Legislative Yuan , while the government structure remains ambiguous , is not the best structural framework .
That said , despite landmark changes such as the full election of the national parliament in Taiwan and establishment of the legal groundwork for the direct election of the ROC president , the ROC Constitution has been revamped with alarming frequency over the past few years .
In fact , some have scoffed that the constitution , the basis upon which the nation 's laws are founded , has been tinkered with more often than the civil and criminal codes .
Further , new duties and authorities were given to the National Assembly in order to achieve successive constitutional revisions .
For instance , in exchange for the assembly agreeing to give up its authority to elect the president , the body was given power of approval over personnel appointments to the Judicial Yuan , Examination Yuan , and Control Yuan .
With each revision , the constitution became increasingly jumbled , while NA delegates leveraged their positions to exact " constitutional amendment rent " and fatten themselves up .
Last year 's term extension bill further solidified the public 's image of the National Assembly as no more than a tool of political struggle , and a self - indulgent body at that , generating widespread consensus on the necessity of dissolving it .
While the latest round of constitutional revisions satisfies the general desire across the political spectrum to progressively dismantle the National Assembly , sloppy accompanying provisions and the failure of the various political parties to propose a new blueprint in its place provide cause for new concern over the health of constitutional government in the ROC .
For example , the National Assembly will become a " task - based body " generated according to the proportion of seats held by each political party in the legislature .
National Taiwan University professor Lee Hung - hsi , an expert on constitutional law , points out that less than 10 % of the Taiwanese population takes part in political party activities .
Thus a National Assembly generated proportionally according to party representation represents suppression of the views of the other 90 % of the population , and thus violates the principle of vesting authority over constitutional government in the people .
Following the demobilization of the National Assembly , many functions and powers currently held by the National Assembly will be transferred to the Legislative Yuan .
This in turn raises fears in the academic community that the Legislative Yuan could become an untamable new constitutional monster .
The expanded powers of the Legislative Yuan also include the impeachment and recall of the president and vice president , and the supplementary election of the vice president .
These changes tighten the relationship between the parliament and the president , requiring the president to report to the Legislative Yuan on the state of the nation .
But the president has only the passive authority to dissolve the parliament .
In the face of a parliament with supreme powers , a president whose party claims only a minority in the legislature is powerless even to replace a premier with whom he does not see eye to eye , leaving him devoid of the authorities and responsibilities to correspond with his administrative actions .
A China Times editorial urged that the question of whether the enormous Legislative Yuan might be split into two houses by function be evaluated and worked out as soon as possible .
The legal demobilization of the National Assembly was conducted without a hitch , yet the future of constitutional government looks bleak .
This dire outlook is surely not something Taiwan 's political parties expected when , attempting to align with public opinion , they moved to phase out the National Assembly .
Party Hardy ?
Will the Election Weaken Political Parties ?
-LRB- Eric Lin / photos by Sinorama Office of Photography / tr. by John Murphy -RRB-
In Taiwan 's " quiet revolution " of democratization , the people have participated enthusiastically , but not irrationally .
Now that there are two strong parties , the KMT and DPP , the slogan of " peaceful rotation of political parties in power " has become one of the most widely used appeals for the opposition .
It happens to be the turn of the mil - lennium , and this has inspired many people to think of change .
In the middle of March , Taiwan will select the president who will lead the island into the new century .
But the election , besides affecting the future direction of the country , has another rarely mentioned dimension : Since the three major candidates Lien Chan , Chen Shui - bian , and James Soong are running roughly equal , this suggests that after the election there may be a restructuring of Taiwan 's political party system .
The people of Taiwan are selecting not only their future leaders , but are choosing a new direction for party politics and democratic development .
What is it about the political environment that means that the election for the president of the ROC , which was not conceived as a presidential system , will affect the future development of the country ?
How will party politics change after the election ?
Is there likely to be a constitutional crisis ?
In Taiwan in the year 2000 , there are many challenges :
The pressure is on to achieve industrial upgrading and internationalization .
Also , there needs to be clear progress in the critical area of cross-strait relations .
Although entry into the World Trade Organization will create a new situation in the Taiwan Strait , the two sides remain in an obscure relationship that is neither war nor peace .
Taiwan must come up with a comprehensive policy that considers economic , diplomatic , and military factors .
Internally , there are a number of worrying problems - " black gold politics " -LRB- the confluence of criminal gangs , moneyed interests , and corrupt politicians -RRB- , rising crime , and only erratic environmental consciousness .
It is urgent to achieve consensus on these problems in order to find solutions .
Three - way battle
The desire for change is reflected in the upcoming presidential election .
This is the beginning of the post-strongman era .
John Pomfret , bureau chief of the Washington Post , points out that , after a long era of rule by virtually unchallenged leaders , the electorate is looking for more choice .
The 2000 race , with so many tickets contending , reflects this aspiration .
At the top , this election is a contest among Taiwan 's second - generation political elites .
Underneath , it is a struggle among the various forces that currently exist in Taiwan 's society .
The KMT nominee , Lien Chan , is seen as Lee Teng - hui 's annointed successor .
He represents the continuation of Kuomintang tradition .
Chen Shui - bian , the nominee of the Democratic Progressive Party , is the greatest hope for the opposition party as it seeks the first - ever transfer of power in Taiwan .
Independent candidate James Soong , meanwhile , represents forces which have split away from the Kuomintang .
He is seen as leading a second wave of " anti-Lee Teng - hui " sentiment , similar to that which led to the creation of the New Party several years ago .
Soong 's candidacy has opened up new fault lines in Taiwan 's party politics , and has attracted the support of many NP legislators and other non-KMT and non-DPP forces .
The New Party itself , which is on the edge of collapse , has nominated the renowned author Li Ao as its candidate , though Li is not a party member .
In addition to these four , former DPP chairman Hsu Hsin - liang , having failed to win the nomination of his party , withdrew from the DPP and is running as an independent .
Since the campaign began in earnest , Lien , Chen , and Soong have been getting roughly similar numbers in public opinion polls , with about a quarter of the electorate undecided .
With the election so close at hand , and the situation so uncertain , naturally the media and society have been focused on analyzing the election battle itself .
Very few people have transcended this to ask what impact the three - way power struggle will have on the future political situation .
Public opinion trial balloon
The ROC constitution was not originally designed as a presidential system .
The constitution divided power among five branches of government , with the premier as head of the executive branch , and the president separate from , but theoretically not controlling , these five .
In the past , presidents Chiang Kai - shek and Chiang Ching - kuo were the de facto unchallenged rulers of the nation , but that was because of their roles as chairmen of the Kuomintang , which , under the old one - party system , outlawed any opposition .
They were president because they were powerful , not powerful because they were president .
But today times have changed , and so has the constitution .
Most importantly , the constitutional power of the president has been greatly increased .
Lin Wen - cheng , an associate professor in the Graduate Institute of Mainland China Studies at National Sun Yat - sen University , notes that the president had always enjoyed a number of special powers : appointing and dismissing of officials , dissolving of the parliament , issuing of emergency decrees in times of national emergency , and determining national - security - related policies through the National Security Council and the National Security Bureau .
But recent constitutional revisions also give the president the power to appoint the premier without requiring approval from the Legislative Yuan .
This means that the president is now the guiding figure behind all executive branch policy .
Of course President Lee Teng - hui 's exercise of such powers has not proved politically destabilizing because he has been concurrently chairman of the KMT , which enjoys a majority in the Legislative Yuan .
However , if the opposition wins the presidency , it is uncertain whether the president and legislature will be able to work together harmoniously .
If there are conflicts , this could spark a constitutional crisis .
Another development that needs watching is that direct election of the president has weakened political parties .
Alexander Lu , professor of political science at National Taiwan University , states that voters no longer base their choice primarily on political party .
This is what has enabled independent candidate James Soong to remain a powerful force even after leaving the KMT .
Whether he wins or not , his candidacy signals a drastic change in Taiwan 's party politics .
Candidate as hero
Lu continues : " Direct election of the president has ' put the candidate on a pedestal , ' turning the attention of the voters to the individual .
But in fact the most significant thing about this election is not which ' hero ' will lead the country .
Rather , voters should pay even more attention to how each of the candidates could affect future party politics and the direction of constitutional development . "
In fact , Taiwan 's main parties - the KMT and the DPP as the two major parties , with the New Party as a noteworthy but limited third force - all understand the implications of James Soong 's powerful candidacy very clearly .
They know that this election is not only a struggle for political office , but even more is a critical moment that may decide whether their respective parties develop , split up , or disappear .
KMT party chairman Lee Teng - hui has repeatedly called on voters to cherish the system of party politics that has been constructed in the process of democratization ; the KMT wants confirmation that people still see it as a coherent , positive political institution .
The DPP sees this election as its chance to displace the KMT and set a precedent for the peaceful rotation of political parties in power , thereby consolidating its position as the main alternative to the KMT .
James Soong , on the other hand , hoping to take advantage of the desire for change , emphasizes that if he is elected as a non-party candidate he will promote reforms which will alter the roles of the major parties .
The New Party is in the most embarrassing position , since its candidate -LRB- Li Ao -RRB- is not even a party member , and has been unable to keep most of its members from shifting their support to Soong instead ; this election could therefore hasten the collapse of the NP .
Peaceful transfer of power
If Chen Shui - bian is elected , this would be Taiwan 's first case of a peaceful transfer of power from one party to another .
DPP legislator Chang Chun - hung says that the process of democratization in Taiwan during Lee Teng - hui 's administration has been smooth and tranquil , but beneath the surface there lurks a major threat to democracy : the KMT 's " black gold politics . "
Explains Chang : The DPP has never had the chance to be the ruling party , and therefore has never been in a position to fulfill its function of restraining the KMT .
The result of this long - term trend is that the KMT is " overnourished " by feeding on the resources of the state and society while the opposition parties are " undernourished . "
Chang says if there were a transfer of power , the opposition would be able to understand more clearly the actual difficulties of governing and to see more clearly the dark corners that need to be cleaned out .
Meanwhile , the ruling party , with its rich experience in governing , would be very qualified to play the role of overseeing the DPP , and a defeat for the KMT could also promote its internal reassessment and reform .
Were Chen Shui - bian to win , though the DPP would take control of the executive branch , Taiwan 's current two - major - plus - one - minor party structure would probably not change very much .
Chen Wen - cheng says that a Chen victory would have its greatest impact on the New Party - and that the effect would be positive .
After an impressive start , the NP has faded steadily over the past few elections , and suffered an especially sharp blow in the election for mayor of Taipei two years ago .
NP votes drifted to Ma Ying - jeou , a member of the KMT -LRB- albeit not one of Lee Teng - hui 's personal favorites -RRB- .
The NP candidate received only an anemic percentage of the ballots , bringing the party to the edge of collapse .
But if Chen Shui - bian becomes president , because the DPP is seen as the party of Taiwan independence - the direct antithesis of the New Party - this could inspire NP members to pull together , and at the same time give the party the status and ability to absorb the forces that are backing James Soong .
This would contribute to the building of a true three - party system .
An opposition - controlled legislature
If Chen Shui - bian is elected , his biggest challenge will come from the Legislative Yuan , and the first problem will be naming a premier .
Although the constitution stipulates that the president does not need the approval of the Legislative Yuan to name a premier , given the fact that the KMT has a majority there , Chen faces the problem of finding a premier who will be able to work with KMT legislators .
The Chen camp is well aware of this problem .
Therefore they have let it be known that Chen would like to ask Lee Yuan - tse , the universally respected Nobel Prize winner who is currently president of the Academia Sinica , to be his premier .
Chen , who knows that within the DPP there is little high - level governing experience , has repeatedly raised the idea of a " coalition government . "
However , it should be noted , there are after all great ideological differences between the DPP and the other parties .
KMT legislator Li Hsien - jen points out that the DPP retains advocacy of Taiwan independence in its party platform , and DPP vice-presidential candidate Annette Lu is well known for her support of Taiwan independence .
It is therefore hard to guarantee that the executive branch will not come into conflict with the legislature .
In such a conflict , the premier would be caught in the crossfire .
The legislature could pass a vote of no confidence and completely boycott the premier , or the premier could dissolve the parliament and appeal to a public referendum .
Either case would spark a constitutional crisis .
Alexander Lu agrees that a Chen victory could lead to inter-branch conflict .
But he does not see Taiwan independence as the main flashpoint .
The critical issues will instead be those related to " black gold politics , " such as stock trading taxes , which directly affect the interests of certain legislators .
Lu explains : " Currently the Legislative Yuan is filled with representatives of capital .
When it comes to laws that directly affect their personal privileges and interests , even the KMT is powerless to control them .
Chen Shui - bian has repeatedly emphasized that he intends to wipe out black gold politics and will never compromise .
Inevitably , then , there will be a clash with these legislators . "
Lien Chan 's burden
If Lien Chan is elected , the party - politics issues most deserving of attention will be whether this hastens the demise of the New Party and whether the KMT party organization and the government can move together in step .
Lien is seen as Lee Teng - hui 's designated successor .
But , given the term system for the chairmanship of the KMT , after the election there will be a period of time in which Lee remains party chairman , while Lien is president .
In the past , state policy has always been decided by the party chairman .
Observers are very curious about whether the KMT has in fact changed , or whether we will see a repeat of what happened back in the late 1970s :
At that time Yen Chia - kan was president , but national policy was in fact determined by Chiang Ching - kuo , whose authority derived from his post as party chairman and who took the position of premier from which to oversee day - to - day policy - making .
As Li Hsien - jen analyzes the situation , if Lien Chan is elected , there will indeed be a transition period in his relations with Lee Teng - hui .
But this is not necessarily a bad thing for the KMT .
Consider , says Li , the fact that James Soong 's candidacy has raised the specter of a party split .
A victory for Lien , with Lee continuing as party chairman , would be helpful to the KMT in resolving internal party disputes , and in consolidating Lien 's party and government position .
He says that it is unlikely that the Yen - Chiang situation would be repeated , since Lee Teng - hui will certainly not have an office like premier which would involve him in day - to - day policy - making .
What would a Lien victory mean for the New Party ?
Remember that the NP was organized primarily out of opposition to Lee Teng - hui .
If Lien Chan can escape from Lee 's shadow , the New Party would lose its original purpose , and members could possibly return to the KMT , restoring the two - party system that reigned before the NP was formed .
Another significant possibility is that New Party members , who tend to support James Soong , could organize a brand - new political party with remnant Soong backers after the election .
Shao Tsung - hai , a professor at National Chengchih University and a campaign staffer for James Soong , states : Soong has reiterated that he personally has no intention of organizing a new political party after the election .
But the political forces that support him will necessarily have to organize themselves in some fashion .
Moreover , after Lee Teng - hui leaves the scene , and the NP no longer has that fixation , the possibility of establishing a new party with Soong 's other supporters -LRB- who by no means necessarily dislike Lee -RRB- increases .
If this happens , the New Party will no longer be in decline as it is now , but will re-emerge as a force to be reckoned with , and Taiwan will be looking at a true three - party system .
If Lien Chan is elected , the KMT will continue to hold both executive power and a legislative majority , and the premier will serve simply as the chief of staff to the president .
However , based on current public opinion polls , it appears that whoever wins , Lien included , will be only a " plurality president , " without a strong mandate to rule .
To a certain degree , then , he will have to accommodate other political forces .
Chang Chun - hung , who knows the legislative environment very well , explains : " Even now in order to pass important legislation there must be compromise and negotiations .
It will be virtually impossible for the KMT to railroad through legislation under the leadership of a president who does n't enjoy majority public support . "
The need for compromise could be further increased by the proposed law currently under discussion to put all party assets in blind trust .
This would , at least on paper , reduce the financial leverage the KMT would have over its legislators , and KMT representatives could become even more difficult for the party to control .
Lien Chan may face the problem of being unable to enforce the decisions of the party center .
If Soong wins . . . .
Many supporters of James Soong are people dissatisfied with the current state of the main parties .
It is generally believed that if Soong wins the election , this could spark a dramatic reorganization of party politics .
The main blow could fall on the New Party , which could find itself made irrelevant , with the KMT also strongly affected .
If Soong wins , it is considered virtually inevitable that his supporters will organize some sort of political organization .
Shao Tsung - hai says frankly that , even if Soong himself does not lead the way , his supporters - faced with the reality of party politics in Taiwan - would have to organize in order to coordinate their operations .
At the same time , according to public opinion surveys , an extremely high percentage of NP members support Soong .
If Soong wins , it would be logical for these people to leave the NP and join forces with other Soong backers , thereby gutting the New Party .
NP secretary - general Lee Ben - nan states : " As early as last year , the leadership realized that our party could potentially disappear " if Soong wins .
But Soong is the closest of the three main candidates to the NP ideals , thus putting the NP in a dilemma .
The party nominated Li Ao to maintain the party profile , and the NP leadership still calls on party members to support Li , but also says it will understand if its members vote for another candidate .
If Soong wins , the KMT could also be thrown into crisis .
In this election , several leading KMT figures have publicly come out in favor of James Soong , and have been expelled from the KMT as a result .
Though these could be explained away as individuals who were not able to satisfy their personal ambitions inside the party , there are also many still in the KMT who secretly are pro-Soong .
If elected , Soong will have a wealth of government resources with which to attract even more people to openly support him , and this could be the straw that breaks the KMT 's back .
Based on this logic , Lin Wen - cheng says that an era of three - party politics is on the way .
Though it is impossible to say whether such a situation would be stable , for those who are dissatisfied with the current choices and who want a reshuffling of party politics in Taiwan , this is the opportunity to create a fresh climate .
Chang Chun - hung suggests that , in addition to uncertainty in party politics , a Soong victory could also bring instability to Taiwan 's constitutional system .
Except for some of his followers who were with him in the provincial government , Soong 's camp lacks any experience in inter-group political bargaining .
With Soong as president , political elites in Taiwan would be , as Alexander Lu describes it , like a basketball team whose players have never played together before .
Soong 's camp will first have to integrate their own internal views , and then , to win confidence and trust from the Legislative Yuan , work with both the KMT and the DPP .
Such a situation is unlikely to result in much policy innovation , and in fact even the initial step of selecting a premier could prove extremely difficult .
Although the KMT , DPP , and NP all have legislators who might join the Soong camp if Soong wins , Soong 's team will still need support from the KMT and/or the DPP , support they can only get through negotiation .
Past experience has shown that the KMT and DPP can work together to boycott Executive Yuan proposals ; if they do this to a Soong - led executive branch , this could lead to a crisis ending in either a vote of no confidence or dissolution of the parliament .
The possibility of a constitutional crisis looks much greater under Soong than under Chen Shui - bian or Lien Chan .
The " he 's one of us " effect
Few voters can see the significance of this election for party politics .
In this atmosphere of choosing among " individual heroes " rather than parties , voters are more concerned about the candidates ' characters and deportment than they are about their policy views or party backgrounds .
That is why Soong , who early on was significantly ahead of his rivals in public opinion polls , saw a dramatic drop in support after the Chung Hsing Bills scandal broke .
Meanwhile , newspapers and TV are filled with negative advertising in which candidates sling mud at one another .
These ads are giving voters the impression that the nation 's future leaders are all " bad apples . "
This not only marks the deterioration of electoral culture , but is a serious blow to morale in the nation and society .
The effects may prove to be far - reaching .
Chang Chun - hung adds that negative election tactics , which after all may be seen in any democratic country , are not - bad as they are - the biggest threat .
He says Taiwan voters should most be on the lookout for the " one of us " effect .
Mobilization of votes based on ethnicity or provincial origin is the cheapest route to victory .
This has long been a tactic used in Taiwan elections .
As a result , Taiwan 's ethnic groups are pitted against one another politically .
Lin Wen - cheng states that in terms of daily life , differences between Taiwan 's ethnic groups have largely disappeared .
But , because ethnic cleavages are constantly being exploited in elections , inter-group political conflict remains serious .
Lin contends : " It is inevitable that minority groups in any society feel insecure about their status .
In the last election for the mayor of Taipei , it was obvious that virtually all mainlanders voted for Ma Ying - jeou .
Because the majority Taiwanese do not feel threatened , they were less likely to vote based on provincial origin , giving Ma enough cross-over votes to beat out Chen Shui - bian .
In this upcoming election , James Soong [ who is a mainlander ] is also getting a lot of support from Hakka people , who sympathize with his outsider status and remember his support for Hakka identity . "
Unfortunately , however " natural " it is that minority groups feel insecure , exploitation of these cleavages for electoral gain can only have a negative long - term impact on society as a whole .
In the 2000 election , Taiwan will not only be choosing a new leader .
It will also be choosing a new direction for party politics , and will help decide future relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and between ethnic groups in Taiwan .
How can people make a wise choice among the many value systems on offer ?
How can they monitor their new leader to ensure that Taiwan has a peaceful future free of the influence of " black gold politics " ?
These are not only questions for this election , but eternal challenges for the whole people in any democratic society .
Bands Make Their Mark
-LRB- Eric Lin / tr. by David Mayer -RRB-
The band tradition in Taiwan dates back to the time when the US military forces had bases on the island .
It was de rigueur to have a live band at all the bars frequented by American soldiers .
Veteran radio program host Tao Hsiao - ching recalls that when she wanted to organize a concert in the 1960s , there were already a lot of bands to choose from .
Apart from bands that worked the bars , there were others that went into the pop music scene .
One example was " The Five Flower Petals , " a five - girl band .
Lead singer Tsai Mi - mi had a very sweet voice -LRB- " Mama ! Mama ! Give me a guitar . . . . " -RRB- , and she was nice looking too .
But the Flower Petals were n't so much a band as a collection of teen idols .
A number of bands appeared in the 1960s that sang mostly Western songs .
Their lead singers sometimes got noticed by music companies and became famous singers .
The most famous ones were Huang Ying - ying , Julie Su , Kao Ling - feng , and Billy .
Campus bands across the island began writing their own music and lyrics in the 1970s .
Notable examples include The Travelers and Wood Guitar .
These bands , and the folk music they sang , reigned supreme on into the 1980s until the sudden rise of a number of extremely popular rock bands .
Some of the more notable 1980s rock bands were The Chiu Chiu 's , The Red Ants , and several bands featuring Hsueh Yueh .
Looking back on the origins of band music , Tao Hsiao - ching attributes its popularity to the albums of Lo Ta - yu and the fact that many proprietors of pubs and other establishments that hire live music started putting emphasis on " the band sound . "
The social commentary in the lyrics of these songs also elicited a strong response .
According to Wang Tsu - shou , a senior reporter at Minsheng Daily , " Youth bands were so popular , we thought for a while that we had entered into a sort of ' Age of the Band , ' but it turned out to be short - lived . "
The high tide of band music spurred the formation of many student bands , and KHS Musical Company used to organize an annual campus rock band competition where many singers and bands got their first big break , including Chang Yu - sheng , Tai Cheng - hsiao , and The Orient Express .
The latter , which was composed entirely of good - looking guys , was the only group that released an album together after going professional , however , while Chang and Tai opted to strike out on their own as solo artists .
As Tao Hsiao - ching explains , band music only appealed to a limited market , and it was very expensive to keep a band operating .
For these reasons , music companies preferred to sign up only the lead singers .
This remained the prevailing pattern in the industry from Kao Ling - feng 's time through the appearance of Chang Yu - sheng .
Then China , Harlem Yu & Ding Jian Pai Dang , Baboo , and Wu Bai and his band all released albums in 1992 .
The music world was electrified , and people began talking once again about the arrival of " the Age of the Band , " but the market for this music was still weak .
The only one of these albums that became a big hit was Harlem Yu & Ding Jian Pai Dang , and this album 's strong sales were due in large part to the fame of the singer , Harlem Yu .
Wu Bai , in the meantime , held fast to his rock style and struggled into the mid-90s .
Then , playing to small pub audiences , he finally hooked up with a band called China Blue and rocketed to immense popularity as locally rooted Taiwanese culture began to take on a certain cachet .
The success of Wu Bai & China Blue has rested primarily , however , on Wu 's reputation as a singer and songwriter , while the band has played more of a supporting role .
Amidst this rebirth of youth bands in the 1990s , there has been a very interesting undercurrent .
Groupie , LTK Commune , and a raft of other underground bands have quietly been carving out a niche for themselves in the pub scene .
Both mainstream and non-mainstream music companies -LRB- such as Friendly Dog and Crystal Records , respectively -RRB- have begun to release their albums , thus giving a small number of enthusiasts ample opportunity to keep up to date with the unde
Pinglin ,
Tea Capital of Taipei County

Take a pinch of Pouchong tea leaves , place them in a cup of boiling - hot water , and before the second hand on the clock has completed a revolution , you 'll be assailed by the delicate fragrance of the freshly made golden green brew .
It 's the same sweet fragrance that fills the air everywhere you go when you 're in Pinglin .
Pinglin Township is situated in rural southern Taipei County .
Being relatively remote , the area was not developed until the late 18th century .
Pinglin is a pocket of level ground set in mountain forests , whence its name , which means " forest on level ground . "
Arriving there , you 're greeted by mountainsides of emerald green surrounding the town of Pinglin , and winding through it the Peishih River , its crystal waters so clear that you can see right to the bottom .
The population is steady at about 6,000 - 7,000 .
It seems just the way it was 20 - odd years ago , and gives the impression that in another 20 years time , it will still retain this way of life without the constant hankering for more .
What is it about Pinglin , nestled on the outskirts of Taipei , that makes it able to maintain an idyllic life free from the lure of material gain ?
Roll out the red tape
In 1979 , the Urban Development Law placed the Pinglin area under controls pertaining to Taipei 's water catchment areas , and since then it has been extremely difficult to cultivate Pinglin 's agricultural land .
Nor can more buildings be put up to cater to any increase in the population .
All that can be done are just very minimal repairs and renovations to the already existing housing stock , and this has caused a sharp decline in the value of land there .
Under the myriad regulations , Pinglin 's population has plummeted .
Although many want to return , they often shy away because of the difficulties life in Pinglin would entail .
Chen Hsin - ping is a man in his early twenties who works at the Ping Lin Tea Museum .
Drinking some wine , he says , " Here in Pinglin we do n't have a single entertainment venue .
Really , not one .
And all the regulations drive us crazy .
If you want to build a house or do some extension , there 'll be some person coming to investigate , and it 's always the same , you ca n't do this , and you ca n't do that . "
The many restrictions safeguard Pinglin 's beautiful natural setting , but they exact a heavy toll from the local people .
Luckily , Pinglin produces fine tea to follow the alcohol in which they drown their cares .
A refined air
Pinglin is an ideal location for tea cultivation , and many there had been doing it since way back , but after Pinglin started winning first prizes in the provincial government 's tea competitions , the government began to pay serious attention to Pinglin tea .
Moreover , seeing the profitability of tea , almost all the local farmers began specializing in tea .
The freshly picked tips of Oolong tea , with their green buds and twin leaves , become a bright and luminous gold when steeped in hot water .
Whether sold domestically or exported , Pinglin 's Pouchong tea enjoys a wide market and good distribution channels .
Both superior and inferior grades of tea bring a good return , and so for 90 % of the people of Pinglin , life revolves around tea .
When the spring and autumn tea harvests are on , the people in every household can barely snatch four hours sleep a night , because the whole sequence from picking the tea leaves and processing them into their final form , requires more than ten uninterrupted hours , at the least .
The fragrance of tea accompanies them to bed each night , and awaits them in the morning .
The days go on in this fashion for a month or two .
Huang Kuei - ying lives in rural Pinglin .
As a young girl she helped with the tea work , and later her husband also cultivated tea .
Remembering the grueling heat of summer , she sighs , " Women in Pinglin have a really hard life .
They get barely a few hours sleep a night in tea - picking season , and they still have to look after their family and the housework . "
Her neighbour , Lin , laughs in agreement , " Tea processing , it just kills you ! "
The Hsin Ping Tea Emporium has won numerous awards in tea competitions .
The proprietor , Mr. Chen , has been associated with tea since he was very young : " I never got very far in school , so the best thing is to keep on growing tea . "
When we turned to the secret of how to process good tea , Mr. Chen was spare with words .
" You need focus , and experience . "
Indeed , to pick tea you have to take into account the weather and then , after selecting just the right time to pick , you carry out a series of fermentation steps that vary depending on just what the leaves are like that day .
How long should the leaves ferment outdoors ?
How long indoors ?
These questions are decided by the grower , using everything at his disposal - eyes , nose , heart , mind , mouth , and hands , all working in harmony .
A tiny bit more , a second less - it 's a discipline and an art .
Following fermentation , step by step , the tips are withered and crumbled , any lumps are broken up , then the tips are fired .
Each of these steps affects the quality of the finished product .
The timing must be accurately calculated , the temperature must be precise .
Unfortunately , there are no standards to follow .
Absolutely everything relies on each grower 's store of personal experience .
Tough times ahead for tea growers ?
The annual tea competition in Pinglin is a chance for tea growers to talk shop .
They examine and appraise the teas , note the aroma and the color of the steeped tea , and assess the good and bad points of every family 's tea .
Different grades will bring different prices on the market .
Award - winning teas often sell out .
For better or worse , the tea growers ' reputations are made on such occasions .
According to Mr. Chen , the growers compare themselves with each other , discussing their processing methods .
When someone does n't do as well as they had hoped in a tea competition , they try to figure out why their tea did n't match up with that of other growers .
" You need to constantly reflect , review and discuss your processing .
That 's the only way to improve the quality . "
These days , about 80 % of the people in Pinglin still depend on tea for their livelihood .
With the economy slowing down , however , tea is not as easy to sell as it used to be .
In the past there used to be a vigorous export market , but the countries of Southeast Asia have cut into the market .
Pinglin has always specialized in quality teas rather than cater to the mass - production foreign tea markets , but if even domestic sales are having difficulties , what can the growers do to ensure their livelihoods ?
Huang Kuei - ying also comments that tea is n't as easy to sell as it once was .
Growers are sometimes exploited by middlemen , and the tea grown with their sweat and blood ends up being sold for a very low price .
" It 's terrible !
Many growers just ca n't find words for what 's happening , especially with what 's going to happen later , joining that whatever - it - is trade organization .
That could really be a disaster ! "
Huang 's concerns may well be shared by many others .
Nevertheless , Mr. Chen has deep confidence , " As long as our tea is good , we need n't fear that no - one will buy it ! "
The township chief , Liang Chin - sheng , does n't hide his pride in and his concerns about Pinglin 's tea industry .
Says Liang , " Here in Pinglin we worship tea as a god .
We look after it like a sweetheart . "
As well as encouraging the local people to constantly enhance their tea growing and processing skills , he devotes even more energy to managing the " tea culture " to which tea has given rise , including by - products such as tea pastries and similar light refreshments .
But far more important , is to draw deeply on Pinglin 's unique and refined qualities as a tea district and imbue the hearts and minds of local inhabitants and visitors alike with a deep appreciation of tea culture .
With this in mind they are training local people to do voluntary cultural work , organizing activities associated with tea , producing and conserving local gazetteers and histories , all richly steeped in the style and romance of tea .
Speaking of the assaults they face with the opening of the market , the township chief knits his brows tightly ,
" I hope the government can do something substantial to promote Taiwanese tea and draw up regulations for proper channels for marketing tea .
Let everyone see how good it is to drink tea , and experience for themselves tea 's benefits .
This is the only way that tea will have a market ; and then the younger generation will be willing to take over from us . "
Hoping for fewer regulations
In early times Pinglin was a key waystation on the Old Tan Lan Trail leading from Taipei to Ilan .
These days the old road has been replaced by the Taipei - Ilan Highway .
The current road brings a lot of visitors to Pinglin and has made transport of the tea produce much easier .
It was originally thought that the Taipei - Ilan Expressway , due for completion in 2003 , would also bring Pinglin new benefits , but the government is now planning to restrict the interchange to only large vehicles and locals from Pinglin .
This is in order to protect the water catchment area .
The township chief throws up his hands and comments with exasperation that in everything the government has done it has treated the local people officiously and shown no confidence in them .
In his view , the government should think of some way whereby both Pinglin and the water resource protection zone can coexist and prosper .
If they 're afraid that the new expressway will bring hordes of people and pollute the water resources , then what they should do , within reasonable bounds , is allow the people here to build public facilities for visitors which will help minimise their impact on the local ecology , for example public toilets and comprehensive rubbish disposal .
This would give people from outside the area more opportunity to appreciate Pinglin 's idyllic natural setting .
The local people have formed a fish conservation team and as a result the Peishih River is now protected .
Many prized species of Taiwanese fish are being propagated .
In the pristine forests are ancient pine forests with species unique to Taiwan , and the deep blue skies attract waves of students to Pinglin to camp out and observe the stars .
The calloused hands of the tea growers are steeped with the vitality of tea .
Last year Pinglin 's Pouchong tea earned the " Presidential Seal . "
The tea growers straighten their backs , throwing themselves into the tea processing , and wait for their sons and grandsons to come home and enjoy a cup of fine tea with them .
So , next time you go to Pinglin , please do n't just treat it as a quick pitstop .
Sit down for a pot of some of the best tea in all of Taiwan .

Rising Tide
-LRB- Chuang Chih / tr. by Robert Taylor -RRB-
Taiwan is currently being gripped by a wave of nostalgia .
If the film In the Mood for Love , starring Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung , shows the face of Hong Kong in the 1960s , what Ko Ching - hua 's book Rising Tide reveals is a story of old Taipei , and the author 's little - known tragic and difficult childhood .
For old Taipei folk in their 50s and 60s , perhaps Ko Ching - hua 's Rising Tide can help them rediscover the feel of that age which was theirs .
And for younger readers , reading the book can be a journey into the past .
Incredible !
This elegant gent before me , dressed in a silk shirt and a dark brown woolen suit with a light , fine check pattern , savoring his coffee and chatting about French films , this classical music lover with a penchant for refined European life , looks utterly the product of a comfortable , happy upbringing .
Who would have thought that a stream of bitterly painful childhood memories would flood through his book - memories that came as a complete surprise even to friends who know him well .
Author Wang Ting - chun writes in his review " The Tide Comes in for Ko Ching - hua " : " I have known Ko for many years , but I was quite unaware of the difficulties of his youth .
Looking back at his easygoing , elegant style , there was nothing about him to suggest he had ever endured hardship . "
Essayist Pan Jen - mu , however , has a much more emotional response :
" Reading Rising Tide reduced me to tears !
For he has expressed all the distress and privations of our youth . "
The images revealed in Rising Tide are many - faceted .
There are the joys and sorrows of the author 's childhood and teenage years ; there are the twists and turns of his love , marriage and his first excursions into the literary world ; there is the nostalgia of an old Taipei resident for Taipei 's past ; and there is also the beautiful story of a literary gardener tilling the soil of his dreams .
Ko Ching - hua -LRB- whose close friends call him " Old K " -RRB- can be called the doyen of Taiwan 's literary world .
His ancestral home was in Yongjia , Zhejiang Province .
Born in Shanghai in 1937 , at the age of seven he was taken by his parents to Kunshan in Jiangsu Province , to be looked after by a family named Gu .
They were rice farmers , and young Ko had to work in the fields , planting rice seedlings and so on .
When he was ten , his father brought him to Taiwan , via Shanghai .
After they disembarked at Keelung , Ko Ching - hua wept all the way as they walked from the pier , past Jen - ai Road and to their home in Ningpo West Street .
It was only when he heard the sound of Peking opera singing coming out of a square wooden box that he stopped crying and asked in bewilderment , " Is there someone in the box ? "
This moment of childish wonder raised the curtain on the drama of his life in Taiwan .
The poor fear moving house
However , he never imagined that the role he was called upon to play would be so lonely and dismal .
Recalling this time so many years later , he still feels pangs of nostalgia for his parents , despite their ill - treatment of him .
His mother and father did not get on well together , and after constant arguments they finally divorced .
Destitute , the family split up and went their separate ways .
Ko Ching - hua 's father Ko Hao was a graduate of the foreign languages department at Hangzhou 's Zhijiang University , and taught English at Taipei First Girls ' High School .
But in Ko Ching - hua 's eyes , he was nothing but a spineless , gullible fool .
It was this spineless father who caused Ko 's childhood to be spent in constant house moving .
In his book , Ko describes his feelings during that time thus : " The poor fear hunger , and also moving house . "
Their series of temporary homes even included an air raid shelter which kept out neither the wind nor the rain , and was not fit for human habitation .
Apart from the problem of accommodation which blighted Ko Ching - hua 's childhood , as a teenager he had to do jobs like selling newspapers and delivering coal briquettes to earn his school fees , so he could finish his schooling .
Ko sums up the poverty which so often made him uncertain where his next meal was coming from , with the simple words : " Hunger is a beast with a painful bite . "
But what anguish lies behind those words !
Ko Ching - hua 's status in Taiwan 's publishing business goes without saying .
In the 25 years since he set up Elite Publishing , which specializes completely in works of literature , he has published many influential books , ranging from Wang Ting - chun 's Open Life and Chi Chun 's Dreaming with a Book for a Pillow to Chang To - wu 's Horses and Foot - Soldiers and Yu Chiu - yu 's A Bitter Cultural Journey .
Ko , who has spent his career publishing other people 's books , had no idea that when he wrote the story of his own childhood it would elicit such a broad response among readers and literature lovers .
He says cheerfully : " I 've made others weep , but I 've made myself laugh . "
Writing the book was a cathartic experience which wiped away the sense of inferiority , the loneliness and the desolation he experienced as a child , so once the book was finished his mood was relaxed and happy .
No wonder Ko says he is now the happiest of men in an unhappy environment .
Walking amid the hubbub of Taipei today , on streets filled with people and traffic , Ko - nan Street , Shanghai Road , the Tri-Service Stadium and the Star Cafe have long since drifted away like the sound of Ko Lan 's mambo song .
Once - familiar scenes are gone with the wind , leaving old Taipei resident Ko Ching - hua somewhat forlorn .
Ko , who likens himself to a peasant in an industrial society , has always insisted on publishing high - quality literature for the common man .
Speaking of the future , he says with a smile that he is planning a long novel .
This is surely something for all of us who love Ko Ching - hua 's writing to look forward to .

Tears that Smile -
Huang Chun - ming 's Letting Them Go
-LRB- Yang Chao / photos by Pu Hua - chih / tr. Scott Williams -RRB-
After more than ten years of silence , a new collection of stories from Huang Chun - ming is a major event , and not just in literary circles .
For readers who have been anticipating a new collection for years , the publication of Letting Them Go is big news .
After such a long " hibernation , " how does this new work compare to Huang 's previous works ?
Sinorama invited the literary critic Yang Chao to provide our readers with the in - depth review which follows .
Huang Chun - ming 's use of fiction to express his concern for the elderly has a long history .
" Cheng - tsai Gets off the Bus , " Huang 's earliest published work , is the tale of an elderly woman taking her grandson to the city to visit her daughter and son - in - law .
Although she is " only 50 , " " her withered face was deeply etched by life and the passage of time . . . giving people the impression that she was in her 60s . "
What really marks her as elderly is not her visage , however , but her inability to carry out a task as simple as catching a bus into the city , and the apprehensive feelings she harbors towards the " cold , unfamiliar " city and the unknown future .
Rural aesthetics
The title of " An Irrational Old Man " makes it plain that it too is a story about an elderly person .
Here , however , Huang has written about a different sort of senior citizen , one who carries within himself a traditional wisdom uncorrupted by modern education .
This wisdom , extremely practical in nature , is part of a piecemeal oral tradition .
It is non-systematic and lacks mechanisms with which to check its own validity .
Nonetheless , when taken as a whole it presents the ideas that there are spirits in the earth and sky , and that the universe is an organic and connected whole .
This is the elderly 's perspective on the universe , and it gives them very different ideas about meaning and beauty .
In dialogue with his grandson Ah - ming , the " Irrational Old Man " passes on his old knowledge : listen to the sound of the waves the wind makes in the rice paddies to discover if the rice is ripe ; fill the bellies of grasshoppers with salt before grilling them ; sparrows are ghosts or spirits which understand human speech ; and killing the lu ti bird brings floods .
At the end , the old man tells the boy of the spirit of the Choshui River , which searches for people to take its place .
In " An Irrational Old Man , " the reader feels very strongly that Huang Chun - ming is playing two roles : that of a little boy listening intently to his grandfather and that of a mature author who longs for the past and wishes to give voice to its earthy old knowledge .
Ah - sheng is the unforgettable elderly protagonist of " Drowning an Old Cat , " the next story in the collection .
Ah - sheng does n't have the life of ease of the " Irrational Old Man , " and he stubbornly resists the encroachment of his enemy , modern life .
In this tragic story , Ah - sheng is ultimately steamrollered by the massive momentum of the new .
But while the tragedy plays itself out , Huang makes it clear to the reader that he stands firmly on the side of Ah - sheng in this conflict .
Not everything in the story is bleak , however .
Huang includes several comic and even farcical scenes , one of which occurs during a carnivalesque town meeting .
There , Ah - sheng demonstrates a startling ability to respond to circumstances and succeeds in wrecking the meeting hall as he makes an eloquent speech on the love of one 's family and birthplace , making " the entire village jump to its feet in agitation . "
And there is a farcical moment at the end as he takes off his clothes and jumps into a private swimming pool , making the ultimate protest by taking his own life .
Old people " let go " by the modern era
This theme of tragedy resulting from changing times has appeared in Huang 's earlier work , in " Cymbal , " for example , which was strongly influenced by Lu Xun 's The Story of Ah Q .
In " Cymbal , " the age of the protagonist , Foolish Chin , is unclear , but the theme of obsolescence remains .
Chin 's work - making announcements in the street while using a cymbal to attract attention - has been made obsolete by the spread of the megaphone , undercutting his social status and taking away his livelihood .
Chin thus takes on the role of a member of the older generation who has lost his struggle to make the transition to modern reality .
Of necessity , his misfortune and his way of thinking have a very " old ' character .
There are reasons to look back to Huang 's early work .
The first is to point out that Letting Them Go - in which the protagonist of every story is an elderly person - is entirely of a piece with his other work .
In fact , it is a return to the main thread of his concerns of 30 years ago .
In the extremely nationalistic atmosphere of the 1970s , Huang changed his focus for a time , writing about the hatred of Japan -LRB- Sayonara , Goodbye -RRB- and about anti-American sentiments -LRB- I Love Mary -RRB- .
Although well received at the time they were written , these works were flawed .
First , they lacked the fine composition of true literature .
Second , in them Huang had moved away from his greatest strength , the characters and settings with which he was truly familiar .
As a result , Huang 's 1970s writings were simply records of the period in which they were written and creative experiments .
They are interesting in their own way , but are by no means among his best works .
Two generations removed
The second reason to look back at Huang 's early fiction is to highlight the continuity of Letting Them Go .
Although it has been more than ten years since Huang 's last collection of fiction , and in spite of the fact that 37 years separate " Cheng - tsai Gets off the Bus " and " Ticket Window , " there is something at the core of Huang 's fiction which has not changed .
In his introduction to Letting Them Go , Huang mentions his deep distress at the plight of the elderly in Taiwan today , notes that he himself is just beginning to enter his twilight years , and compares Taiwan 's callous treatment of the elderly to the way in which the elderly were left to live or die on their own in the mountains in You Shan Jie Kao .
All of this could very easily give the reader the mistaken impression that Huang 's vision of the elderly is a new development .
But this is simply not the case .
In Letting Them Go , what we are actually seeing is the rebirth of Huang 's original passion .
If there has been any change in his portrayal of old people over the last 37 years , it is only in perspective .
He used to write of grandfathers from the point of view of grandsons .
Now he is a grandfather himself .
Huang Chun - ming has often discussed the fact that he was raised largely by his grandparents , and that he had an unusually close relationship to them .
This background accounts for the unique " generation gap " approach utilized by Huang in his fiction .
Each of Huang 's works describes a particular person or thing , and has an " implied reader " at which it is directed .
In the past , Huang 's " generation gap " separated him from the people he was writing about - people of his grandparents ' generation , two generations removed from his own .
Now , this " generation gap " stands between him and the " implied reader " of his fiction - children of his grandchildren 's generation who are ignorant of traditional wisdom .
Another aspect of Huang 's work is that it presents many of the characteristics sociology attributes to relationships between people two generations removed from one another .
For example , such relationships are not usually as tense , direct or hurried as those between parents and children because grandparents are not as busy as parents , and have less responsibility to supervise and teach .
Also , difficulties in communication between grandparents and grandchildren frequently arise because of the very different modes of expression employed by each .
As a result , there are typically more miscommunications in such relationships than there are between parents and their children .
A soft heart
Viewing Huang 's fiction in this way , we can perhaps more clearly see wherein lies its charm .
Huang is never derisive or critical of his elderly characters .
If we compare him to other Nativist writers who address the tragedy of the rural elderly unable to adapt to the modern industrial world , we note that Huang is reluctant to expose his elderly characters to unmitigated suffering .
Other Nativist writers use stories of suffering and pitiable elderly persons to make the case for reform .
Huang takes a much gentler approach - not because he thinks the modern world a perfect place , but because he can not bear to be so harsh .
Huang 's tender - heartedness is apparent to the reader of his work .
In his fiction , Huang is both more sensitive to and places greater importance on the elderly 's haphazard means of expressing affection than are other Nativist writers .
" Fish , " one of his early works , has become very widely known since being incorporated into the national middle - school literature curriculum .
The story describes an unexpected conflict that arises out of a misunderstanding between a child and a grandfather who care deeply for one another .
Similar sorts of emotions are expressed in " Letting Them Go " as well .
In this later story , the elderly Ah - wei inexplicably goes out and catches an egret , then just as inexplicably lets it go .
Both of these actions are indirect expressions of a deep love he can not give voice to yet nonetheless feels for his son Wen - tung .
A smile and a tear
When Huang writes of sad events , his readers ' eyes really do fill with tears .
However , the most exceptional thing about Huang as a writer is that he is not satisfied with making his readers cry .
He wants every tear that falls to be accompanied by a small smile .
And he is able to have it both ways because of the deep and tender sympathy of his work .
The stories in Letting Them Go are filled with elderly characters .
Some are ignorant and suffer , like the old woman of " Cheng - tsai Gets off the Bus . "
But more of them are , like the protagonist of the " Irrational Old Man , " full of a wisdom unsuited to the times in which they live .
Their tragedy is that they are out of step with the times , that they do not know how to adapt to this cold and chaotic new society .
The comedy of their predicament grows out of their unwillingness to let go of the " old " wisdom and " old " ways that they have treasured for so long , out of their flaunting of this " old " knowledge , and out of their use of their " old " assumptions to guess their way through the " new " world .
Their guesses are all wrong , of course , but in their creation of misunderstanding upon misunderstanding , we see a different kind of dignity .
And in this " old " wisdom and these " old " ways , we also see a light that time can not dim .

Soldier Ants : Maysing Yang Calls for NGO Mobilization
Maysing Yang , vice chair of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ' Research and Planning Board , lived for many years in New York .
She joined Taiwan 's political opposition movement very early in her career , and for a time chaired the Democratic Progressive Party 's Foreign Affairs Committee .
After the DPP gained control of the central government , in view of Yang 's long overseas experience of diplomatic affairs and the overseas Chinese community , she was recruited into the cabinet to take over the important position of vice chair of the MOFA 's Research and Planning Board .
In late August 2000 , Maysing Yang and presidential advisor and former DPP chairman Peng Ming - min led a delegation to attend the 53rd Annual DPI / NGO Conference of the United Nations Department of Public Information .
She became the first serving MOFA official to enter the UN headquarters building since the ROC left the UN .
When news of this got out , the PRC delegation at the UN immediately pro-tested , and demanded that the two should leave the conference chamber and be excluded from the UN building .
The next day , showing commendable courage , Yang and Peng slipped back into the conference chamber .
But their actions also attracted the criticism that this kind of high - decibel display is not in fact helpful for achieving Taiwan 's return to the United Nations .
However , Yang does not subscribe to this view .
Enthusiastic , outspoken and full of vitality , she is highly optimistic about Taiwan 's prospects for participation in UN - associated NGOs , and believes that as temples of popular campaigning , NGOs can develop the strength of the Taiwanese people .
Below she describes her views .
After the new government took office , apart from being briefed on our diplomatic partners and on countries with which we do n't have diplomatic relations , I also looked at civic organizations with which the MOFA has contacts and which are frequently active in the international community .
I discovered that the World League for Freedom and Democracy is a well - run international organization with a complete organizational structure , is a member of the UN 's Department of Public Information , and attends the Annual DPI / NGO Conference every year .
This year too it was planning to attend the millennium edition of the conference .
Therefore when Professor Peng invited me to attend , I agreed to join the delegation as an advisor to the league .
The MOFA was very excited about my attending the conference , because we can say that this is the first time a MOFA official has entered the UN headquarters building in the last 30 years .
Everyone thought it was a great breakthrough .
I also took the opportunity to personally get an understanding of how the DPI / NGO Conference works , and of the direction of mainstream international thinking , and I collected a lot of relevant information in the form of conference materials .
Thus we gained a great deal from attending .
One of the main topics at this year 's conference was the issue of how to go about monitoring how governments put into action their ideals and their promises to their peoples .
Another main focus of discussion was the partnership between NGOs , national governments and the UN itself .
These are all very important things for Taiwan to be thinking about , so we ought to participate more .
The UN itself is an organization of national governments .
At present we are excluded , and that is very difficult to change .
NGOs represent a very good point of access .
Today there are a tremendous number of NGOs .
They hold frequent conferences , and they have an ever - growing influence on governments .
For example , a couple of months ago I went to Warsaw to attend the International Forum on Democracy .
The forum was attended by foreign ministers from over 100 countries , but it was also an NGO conference .
Those attending included the great American entrepreneur George Soros , who funded the forum , the former US ambassador to Beijing , Winston Lord , and so on - all high - ranking , highly influential people .
In other words , NGOs are very broad church .
Retired diplomats , business - people , social campaigners , academics and all kinds of foundations may be involved in NGOs .
NGOs can be more powerful than governments , so governments certainly ca n t afford to ignore them .
At present , apart from the World League for Freedom and Democracy , a number of other NGOs in Taiwan are associated with the UN , including women 's , aboriginal and academic groups .
We hope that in the future more groups will actively develop an international profile , and apply to register with the UN .
Another way people in Taiwan can actively participate in international affairs is by encouraging people of ability and influence in society to apply to join the UN 's own NGOs , such as population , human rights , peace and environmental groups , so that they can contribute their knowledge , and at the same time let others better understand people from Taiwan .
We are living in an age of people power , and the UN is responding to the trends of our time .
In the past , NGOs merely played a monitoring role at the UN , but now the trend is towards their involvement in policy implementation .
Hence in our future approach to the UN , besides continuing to press for admission by mobilizing our diplomatic partners to speak on our behalf , we should also actively seek to make the most of the power of our people .
In particular , in the age of the Internet , universal values such as humanitarianism and human rights transcend the narrow confines of national boundaries and nationalism .
The Taiwan issue is one of basic human rights .
In other words , the people of Taiwan are being denied the right to speak and vote in international affairs .
We can use the Internet to gain the support of international champions of justice .
Furthermore , among Taiwanese compatriots living overseas there are many who opposed the old government , but are willing to support the new .
These people are excellent partners through whom we can participate in UN NGOs .
We should n't be afraid of the Chinese communist regime 's attempts to suppress such activity
.
They wo n't last forever , and they ca n't discourage everyone who supports us .
Taiwan 's Fitness Market
Gets Pumped Up

In the last few years , Tai - wan has been swept by a fitness fad .
Clubs offering workout facilities have sprung up incredibly quickly , so that now , counting both established firms and newcomers , there are more than 700 separate locations !
In the midst of an economic downturn , the fitness business is remarkably robust .
It is especially noteworthy that in this new century large foreign health clubs have set their sights on the Taiwan market , hanging out their well - known shingles in a battle for market share with local firms .
This struggle has brought the fitness market to a fever pitch , and also is sparking new and diversified ideas about health in Taiwan .
" A health club is a playground for adults , that 's what it is ! " says Mr. Wu , a florist .
This health club in Taipei 's fashionable eastern district , with its stylish lighting and blasting music , is more like a discotheque .
Mr. Wu has just completed his step aerobics class .
As he catches his breath , he says that he never much liked exercise , but that in the half year since joining the club his life has been dramatically transformed .
Not only is his body slimmed down , but he looks and feels much more energetic .
Recreational fitness
" At first I came just to get in shape .
I signed up with a group of friends who talked me into it .
But it 's fantastic here .
Every time I enter the club and hear that pounding music , I get a rush .
And with so many different and fun aerobics classes , exercise is n't hard labor anymore , " he says .
And thanks to joining the club , the naturally shy Wu has made a lot of new friends .
In another club which offers a swimming pool and " spa " services -LRB- like mineral baths or massage -RRB- , a group of middle - aged ladies who work out in the afternoons sit by the side of the pool enthusiastically talking about the best way to reduce fat around the waistline .
Mrs. Wang declares : " Coming to the health club together is now the most frequent way we neighbors socialize .
Plus by keeping slim you are less likely to get diseases connected to obesity , and you can look younger to boot ! "
Within the last year , gleaming new health centers have set up shop in the Tong Lin Department Store in the Eastern District , the NOVA shopping center near the train station , and the Spring Galaxy theater complex in Hsimenting .
In order to keep up with the competition , the Far Eastern , Sincere , and Asiaworld department stores will also go into business with health centers this year .
And that 's just in Taipei .
Meanwhile , numerous gyms , billing themselves as " recreation clubs , " have opened in the cities of Taichung , Tainan , and Kaohsiung .
A national movement
Seeking to find market niches , various clubs are targeting specific market segments .
Some are for women only .
Others , like California Fitness Centers and Gold 's Gym , set up in commercial districts , aiming for office workers .
Alexander , an island - wide chain , is family - friendly , open to all ages .
Agora Garden , which commands steep prices , combines fitness with business conferencing functions .
The variety is bewildering and the numbers - now more than 700 locations around Taiwan - are astonishing .
Rex , an overseas Chinese from South Africa , who began his career as a trainer at California Fitness Centers , took notice of this wave beginning to build three years ago , and returned to Taiwan to devote himself to the local market .
Analyzing the current direction , he says that global trends and the explosion in media have brought Western ideas of beauty to Taiwan , and the ideal of the " firm and healthy " physique is driving Taiwan consumers into the gym .
" People in Taiwan are beginning to accept that a beautiful body requires effort , and you are n't going to get a sculpted physique with vibrating massage chairs , beauty parlors , or weight - loss pills , " he says .
But people in Taiwan have never had the idea , now common in the West , that physical fitness should be part of the routine of life .
A sculpted body alone is unlikely to be enough to get people motivated to work out -LRB- otherwise you would n't see people spending so much money at beauty parlors for a quick fix -RRB- .
This is why multi-functional health centers - offering health , a good body , fun , and socializing - are driving the market , so that working out has become a fashionable leisure - time activity , and Taiwanese , never known for their love of athletics , are heading in droves to have fun at the gym .
Local vs. foreign
In general , you could divide the main orientations of Taiwan gyms into two basic types : local and Western .
Large health centers which are backed by local investors and managed by local people focus on combining the long - held beliefs that fall under the traditional Chinese idea of " health cultivation . "
These types of gyms incorporate spa , beauty , aromatherapy , and recreational functions under one roof .
Tang Ya - chun , chairwoman of the largest local chain , Alexander Health Clubs , which has 20 locations island - wide , says that the habit of working out must be cultivated over the long term .
Many people join with a sudden burst of interest , but drop out halfway .
In order to keep business going , and keep people coming habitually over the long term , it is necessary that health centers appeal to customers with " freebies " - meaning gain with no pain .
" If health centers can offer not only working out but also recreational functions , then members will keep coming back , " says Tang .
" Modern urban life is stressful and fast - paced , and sometimes a member may be more in need of the relaxation provided by a sauna or aroma - therapy .
Then next time they 'll come back for a workout . "
A mix of freebies and challenges is better at keeping consumers ' motivation high .
While they share the ambition of attracting more people to their ranks , foreign chains nonetheless take a different approach .
Right now the most noteworthy foreign group in Taiwan is California Fitness Centers , which now has three gigantic branches .
Asian regional CEO Eric Levine says that he does not agree with offering spa and aromatherapy facilities in a gym , because these encourage " laziness . "
But it can not be denied that working out is a relatively new concept in Asia .
Hence , California 's approach is to make exercise " recreational " and " fashionable . "
As Levine explains : " We have deliberately put more lighting and decor into our Asian locations , and placed them in the busiest shopping districts , in hopes that working out will become fashionable , and going to the gym will be like going to a good pub .
We want it to be more cool , more exciting , and more fun than a traditional gym , and for members to come to the center with the same attitude they take shopping for Chanel or Prada . "
Levine says that working out is already part of life in the West , so people do n't go to the gym to socialize .
But Asians prefer group activities , and as a result California is putting more emphasis on aerobics classes , with classes every hour all day , so that members can join in any time .
Each center also has dozens of trainers who provide free advice or paid workout supervision .
When East meets West
No matter what tack operators may take to attract consumers , large health centers provide mainly the same services .
Besides traditional equipment for weightlifting and cardio - pulmonary exercises , most have made aerobics the centerpiece in the new fitness fad .
There are all kinds , such as martial arts aerobics , step aerobics , Latin aerobics , and weight - enhanced aerobics .
As their names suggest , these classes modify traditional aerobic dance by adding martial arts moves , step platforms , Latin rhythms , dumbbells , and other props , thereby placing the focus of the workout on different muscle groups .
In addition , aerobics centers commonly provide classes in Asian health techniques like yoga , tai - chi , and qigong .
" Yoga and tai - chi have not been added just for Taiwan , " says Eric Levine .
In fact , the trend in fitness is toward a more Oriental approach , such as the inclusion of martial arts or " power yoga " into aerobics .
There is little tradition of athletics in Taiwan , and it is too early to talk about any uniquely local forms that can be incorporated into Western workouts .
But it is interesting to observe how differences in definitions of beauty have affected exercise preferences .
Rex , with his many years of training experience , finds it especially notable that " women in Taiwan do n't really go for the American female approach of developing muscular bodies .
They prefer lithe bodies , and as a result they are much more into aerobics than weight training .
Most guys in Taiwan , meanwhile , focus on the upper body , and are looking for form , rather than aiming to be hugely muscular . "
Healthy consumption ?
You might think that local health centers , with more attention to relaxation and " health cultivation , " would attract a higher age bracket , while foreign centers , with the accent on fashion and novelty , would draw the younger crowd .
But these lines do not necessarily define how consumers choose .
Cheng Chia - cheng , who has just finished his military service and is preparing for the bar exam , says that his main consideration in choosing a center was location and convenience .
He does n't like the crowded feeling of the shopping district .
" When you work out , the atmosphere should be calm , so that you can use different equipment when you need to and your concentration is n't broken by disturbances . "
Liang Yung - hwa , manager of the Yungho branch of the Eslite bookstore , who has been working out for five years now , says that the new clubs spend too much money on lighting and on equipment that people who are really serious about working out never use , so the membership fees are three to four times those of the older gyms .
He declares : " The lives of city people are incredibly busy , and it 's already a luxury to have an hour a day to work out , so there is n't much time to waste on stuff that is purely for recreation .
But if you consider that it costs NT$ 20,000 in annual fees , plus the initial membership price of another NT$ 10 - 20,000 - altogether about a month 's salary for an office worker - most of that money is wasted . "
With consumers like him , who do n't throw their money around , despite the proliferation of new health centers , traditional gyms have not been badly affected .
Chen Ting - yin , the proprietor of the Taipei Gym , which has been going strong for 16 years now , says that the fitness fad is good for all exercise enthusiasts : " Ten or so years ago people had to scrape together a bunch of odds and ends of free weights , which of course limited how much could be done .
Now there are machines available for training each particular muscle . "
Though , he adds , there is also such a thing as too much equipment of little value .
Fitness or foolhardiness ?
Fitness is a worthwhile investment as well as being a fad .
But blind following of fads can lead to an outcome exactly opposite to the one desired .
Chung Pei - chen , chairwoman of the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine at the Taiwan Adventist Hospital , says that from time to time whole families take up special offers and join together , but , in her opinion , health club facilities -LRB- except for swimming pools -RRB- are not necessarily suitable for all age groups .
" People over 50 or under 16 can easily hurt themselves lifting heavy weights , so I tell people not to be foolhardy , " she says .
The muscles of older people are less securely attached to their bones , and unless a person has been working out since a young age , sudden intense exercise can lead to a deterioration of cartilage , with more damage than benefit for the body .
As for children , they tend to think of exercise as just a kind of play , with accidents often resulting because of fooling around .
Dr. Chung suggests that fitness should begin when young , and those who start very late should stick to swimming , fast walking , and exercise bikes , which are of moderate intensity .
And she adds , " It 's more natural just to exercise when and where you can in daily life - take a walk in the park , climb the stairs . . . . "
Be that as it may , walking in the park is no substitute for a sustained workout program .
Chiang Li - hua , a sales manager in a high - tech industry who has been working out for 15 years , from the earliest Clark Hatch Fitness Center to the health and beauty center in a hotel today , says that people who work out for a long time truly love exercise , love themselves , and are seeking a better quality of life .
This is a habit that is well worth investing in , and people should force themselves to go .
" It 's better to invest in training your body than to spend time and money on medical care when you get sick , " she says .
As for the future , health club managers are optimistic about the potential market .
Eric Levine relates that the Tong Lin branch of California has more members than any of their branches anywhere in the world .
Working out is not like other consumer behavior : The demand for exercise among modern people will only increase , not decline .
It seems that at least as far as the operators are concerned , Taiwan health clubs are certainly working out .

Taiwan Rushes Aid to Quake - Stricken El Salvador
-LRB- Tsai Wen - ting / tr. by David Mayer -RRB-
El Salvador , an ROC diplomatic ally in Central America , was hit on January 13 by an earthquake measuring between 7.4 and 7.9 on the Richter scale .
The earthquake killed hundreds and left tens of thousands homeless .
As soon as reports of the earthquake came in , the ROC government donated US$ 200,000 to support disaster relief efforts , and within 24 hours had dispatched a team to help rescue victims .
It truly does seem that " when it rains , it pours , " for India was then visited on January 26 by its biggest earthquake in 50 years , and according to official estimates the death toll may rise to over 20,000 .
Although the ROC does not have official ties with India , as Sinorama went to press on January 29 rescue teams from Taiwan were standing by for departure , awaiting only the go - ahead from India .
Just short of noon on Saturday , January 13 , most everyone in El Salvador was at home preparing for lunch when the earth below their feet suddenly began to shake violently .
Just outside the capital of San Salvador , a hillside collapsed in the community of Las Colinas , burying more than 260 homes and 1,200 residents .
As of January 29 , the confirmed toll from the earthquake stood at 726 dead and 4,440 injured , with 120,000 homes either totally or partially destroyed and more than 980,000 left homeless .
Over 600 aftershocks have hit El Salvador since January 13 .
The difficulty of emergency rescue efforts has been greatly exacerbated by collapsed road surfaces and interrupted power , water , and telephone services .
President Carlos Flores declared a state of emergency , called for an all - out effort to save lives , and asked for international relief assistance .
Hell on earth
Relief teams and supplies began arriving from around the world on the day after the quake .
In addition to teams from nearby Mexico , Guatemala , and Venezuela , a Spanish team also arrived very quickly , followed soon thereafter by counterparts from Panama , Nicaragua , Germany , France , and Turkey .
The Taipei City Government 's international search and rescue team arrived on January 16 .
This team , which had received three months of training in the US last year , went immediately into action after their long air trip , as the search and rescue command center in El Salvador arranged for it to head to Las Colinas , where the worst of the disaster had taken place .
The team started out using advanced equipment capable of detecting signs of life under the rubble , including flexible fiber optic video cables and ultra-sensitive audio devices .
When these methods did not yield survivors , the team began digging and using more aggressive search techniques .
These methods , too , failed to turn up any sign of life .
At that point relief teams went into Las Colinas with bulldozers and mechanical shovels to clear out the rubble and retrieve the bodies of the dead .
In his condolence message to El Salvador , ROC President Chen Shui - bian stated that the people of Taiwan , having suffered a terrible earthquake of their own in September 1999 , were acutely aware of what people in El Salvador were going through .
In addition to the relief assistance provided by the ROC government , a lot of aid also poured forth from the private sector .
The ROC Red Cross Society donated 10,000 blankets and 400 tents .
The Chinese Children 's Fund is planning to send US$ 300,000 in private donations via the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to provide support for 2,000 children .
The governments of Taichung County and Nantou County , which were hardest hit by the 1999 earthquake in Taiwan , also made big contributions to the relief effort .
Teams from these areas arrived in El Salvador armed with experience , an advanced global positioning system , and tunneling equipment .
They also donated tents and other necessities .
In the dark days following Taiwan 's September 1999 earthquake , the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies donated US$ 27,890,000 to Taiwan , and these funds proved a tremendous help in our reconstruction effort .
International relief teams worked around the clock to find survivors , and thousands made homeless by the quake sheltered from the cold in donated tents and sleeping bags .
Even the dead in many cases were transported to their final resting places in donated body bags and coffins .
Now that a similar disaster has been visited upon one of our diplomatic partners , it is time for the ROC to repay its debt to the international community .
The power of nature
Major earthquakes in recent years have claimed nearly 20,000 lives in Turkey and over 2,500 in Taiwan .
The death toll in El Salvador is expected to climb to over 1,300 .
In the meantime , the Richter 7.9 earthquake in India 's western state of Gujarat has completely leveled the town of Bhuj , and official sources expect the death toll to exceed 20,000 .
While relief teams have been dispatched from around the world , India indicated that it would not need assistance from Taiwan for the time being .
There is nothing anyone can do to prevent earthquakes from occurring , but specialists have noted that the consequences of the recent quakes were made worse by man - made factors , such as overpopulation , environmental degradation , and shoddy construction .
El Salvador is the most densely populated nation in Central America , with some 6 million people living in a territory covering over 20,000 square kilometers -LRB- about two - thirds the size of Taiwan -RRB- .
The economy has been developing briskly ever since the country 's long civil war came to an end in 1992 , and El Salvador plays an important political role both internationally and in the Central American region .
In these respects , El Salvador 's situation is very similar to that of Taiwan .
Overdevelopment of the hillside at Las Colinas may have been one cause of the landslide that buried the residential neighborhood down below .
After one has seen so many dead bodies and heard the anguished wailing of bereaved relatives , it is hard to ignore the wisdom of calls to live in harmony with nature .
It takes a very long time to recover from an earthquake .
After the search and rescue operations have come to an end , reconstruction begins .
This is a massive undertaking that never proceeds quickly .
In a message to the international community , President Flores stated , " I hope that relief assistance has not come to an end .
It should continue as we work on reconstruction . "
If anyone in Taiwan wishes to contribute to reconstruction in El Salvador , they are urged to contact the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ' task force on reconstruction -LRB- tel : 02 - 2348 - 2192 or 02 - 2348 - 2195 -RRB- .

What Price Public Art ?
-LRB- Tsai Wen - ting / tr. by Christopher MacDonald -RRB-
The art market in Taiwan has tended to focus on oil painting and ink - and - wash , with relatively little interest in sculpture , photography , ceramics and multimedia .
However , tens of millions of NT dollars have now become available for work in a range of forms , under the provisions of a 1992 law requiring at least one percent of the budget for major infrastructure projects to be spent on public art .
As a result , artists from Taiwan and abroad have been scrabbling for a slice of the public art pie .
In Taipei , 1997 was designated as the Year of Public Art , and the following year experimental installations went on display at nine cultural centers around the island , chosen by the Council for Cultural Affairs -LRB- CCA -RRB- .
1998 also saw the adoption of new measures governing the installation of such works .
As public art began to proliferate , university departments of art , environment and architecture , spurred by demand , began offering public art courses .
Golden opportunity
The development of a number of major infrastructure projects , including the Taipei MRT system , the Second Northern Freeway and the new terminal at CKS Airport , released millions - even hundreds of millions - of NT dollars for spending on public art , creating a golden opportunity for eager artists .
During 1999 , 30 works of public art were completed in line with official provisions , at a cost of NT$ 40 million .
But the budget for yet - to - be - installed works is even more staggering : NT$ 100 million for public art at the new CKS Airport terminal alone , NT$ 85 million for spending by the Kaohsiung port authority , and NT$ 80 million for stations along the Wanhua - Panchiao branch of Taipei 's MRT network .
At a time of bleak economic prospects , public art commissions have become a beacon for artists .
No wonder some prefer to enter public art contests rather than accept the honor of selection committee membership .
The fact that the contest for nine works to be placed along Taipei 's " Tunhwa Art Corridor , " organized by Taipei 's Urban Development Department , drew entries from over 130 artists , shows how intense the competition can be .
And it is sculptors who have been the biggest beneficiaries of the new policies , since three - dimensional art is the most suitable form for installation in open spaces : of the 55 public art works completed in 1998 , 40 were works of sculpture .
Art engineering ?
At present , public art is chosen through one of four methods : open competition , invitation to tender , commissioning , and direct purchase .
The process has to involve a selection committee from the CCA or relevant cultural department at the local level , comprising artists , architects , landscape designers , art educationalists and so on .
The committee appraises works for artistic quality , suitability for the location , safety and feasibility .
Entries which pass the first round are presented for public demonstration and discussion among the community , so as to avoid subsequent protests .
Unlike those working with other forms of art , the creators of public art need to have a grasp of architectural structure , environmental scenery and even accounting procedure .
Artistic conception alone is not enough .
They will be submitting expenditure claims and dealing with issues including long - term maintenance and cleaning , and maybe utility supply .
A number of artists have thus found it helpful to pool their talents , setting up workshops geared chiefly to the production of public art .
Priceless art ?
Transparency and professionalism in the public art selection process should be beneficial to the overall art environment in Taiwan .
But Huang Wen - ching , a number of whose works have been successfully selected , points out that artists still have to overcome frequent misunderstandings , such as when the cost of their material
Chinese New Year in the Southern Hemisphere
-LRB- by Lin Ying - hua , Auckland , New Zealand / tr. by Christopher MacDonald -RRB-
It was the middle of summer in New Zealand , and the time for celebrating Chinese New Year .
There are plenty of Asian immigrants on the east side of Auckland , and if New Zealanders can have Christmas on a sweltering hot day , then why should n't we Asians do something to mark our traditional New Year ?
Thus it was that the United Asian Association -LRB- UAA -RRB- and the Hua - Hsia Association - a Taiwanese organization - organized the " Celebrating Oriental New Year " event .
To our surprise , over 10,000 visitors came for the performances , along with a number of leading politicians including Prime Minister Jenny Shipley and the mayor of Manukua .
The event took place outdoors in Howick Domain and lasted over five hours .
In addition to the Hua - Hsia Association , groups representing Korea , the Philippines , Malaysia and other Asian countries participated .
The stage was meticulously decorated , with Chinese lanterns hanging from the canopy and a scarlet imperial robe draped against the black backdrop , creating a very Chinese atmosphere .
There were folk dances performed in traditional Chinese costume , and towards the end , a spectacular dragon dance given by members of the Hua - Hsia Association .
The sound of gongs and drums filled the air , along with clapping and gasps of admiration from the audience .
Not many knew how much hard work had gone on behind the scenes for this successful cultural event .
Support from the then - representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in New Zealand , R.C. Shih , was an important element in the event 's success .
The chairman of the UAA , Sharon Stewart , is a New Zealander who is very fond of Asian culture .
She holds regular seminars for new immigrants , and was recently awarded the Queen 's Service Medal in recognition of her dedication .
The UAA holds a " Celebrating Oriental New Year " event at this time every year as a way of encouraging cultural interchange , but every year it is a struggle to find co-sponsors willing to provide funding .
On this occasion , R.C. Shih 's support led to the event being jointly presented by the Hua - Hsia Association and the UAA .
With the Hua - Hsia Association 's committed support there were more than 30 snack booths present , giving the event the lively feel of a Chinese temple celebration .
The foreigners [ non-ethnic Chinese ] present were amazed in particular by the mass dragon dance that members of the Association performed .
A few years ago , when New Zealand was newly opened up to immigration and there were n't many Chinese around , hardly anyone had heard of the Hua - Hsia Association , and inviting government officials to attend such events was always fraught with difficulty .
As more and more Asian immigrants arrived , members of Parliament - vying for votes - began participating enthusiastically in the Association 's events .
The fact that the Association has supported charitable causes in New Zealand for many years , donating time and money , has been especially important in terms of getting taken seriously by the government , and it is thanks to the efforts of immigrants from Taiwan that successes like the New Year celebration have become possible .
For our family , it was our tenth year in New Zealand since arriving as immigrants .
Our daughter had just turned ten and our son was starting primary school when we came here .
During the tough years as new immigrants we overcame numerous difficulties of language and culture , working to establish ourselves in this foreign land .
We wanted our children to quickly adapt to the Western world but without forgetting their Chinese roots , so we endlessly reminded them that we will always be " descendants of the Yellow Emperor , " and urged them to merge into Western society with the characteristic tenacity and humanity of Chinese people .
When the UAA was first set up in 1995 , Sharon came to our house in need of assistance from the Chinese community , filled with enthusiasm but uncertain about how to make contact with the Chinese .
Our daughter has been Sharon 's pal ever since , and it was she who suggested that Sharon see R.C. Shih about a co-sponsor for this year 's New Year celebration .
Several weeks before the event Sharon asked me if I wanted to design a special garland to welcome the prime minister .
As a Howick resident and a floral designer , how could I refuse ?
I used scarlet silk cord and miniature embroidered Chinese slippers -LRB- as used in Chinese knotting -RRB- along with dried flowers , to make a red and gold garland .
As I put it on the premier I explained that these were lucky colors used for Chinese New Year .
She was delighted with this beautiful souvenir , rich in Chinese culture and art , and said she would keep it forever .
With the steady introduction of Chinese culture into this country , New Zealanders are generally more aware of Taiwan than before , and immigrants from Taiwan have been working hard to soften the anti-Asian sentiments of the locals .
When the program of New Year performances wrapped up , many New Zealand friends came forward to express their thanks , saying that they now felt more familiar with China and were eagerly looking forward to next year 's " Howick in the Park " !

The high point of the event came when the prime minister addressed the audience , standing before an imperial Chinese robe .
Teng Hsiang - yang :
Self - made Ethnographer
-LRB- Chang Chiung - fang / photos by Vincent Chang / tr. by David Mayer -RRB-
If you take an interest in the aboriginal tribes of central Taiwan , it wo n't be long before you run into the name of Teng Hsiang - yang .
It matters little what leads to this interest .
You might be filming a documentary or writing a magazine or newspaper article .
You might be engaged in a high - powered research project at Academia Sinica , or just writing a graduate thesis .
In any case , Teng 's copious fieldwork is not something you can afford to ignore .
Among other projects , Teng 's work with the Thao -LRB- also known as the Shao or Sao -RRB- , a tiny aboriginal tribe living in the vicinity of Sun Moon Lake , looms particularly important in the wake of the Chichi earthquake , for the temblor has dealt a heavy blow to a community that now has only 282 members left .
Teng has thrown himself wholeheartedly into the task of rebuilding the one village where the Thao remain .
So who exactly is Teng Hsiang - yang ?
How did he become such an important figure in the academic community ?
Teng Hsiang - yang had originally been planning to catch a flight on September 23 to celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival together with his wife and children .
Little did he know , however , that his plans would be interrupted on September 21 by the biggest earthquake to hit Taiwan in a century .
A giant jolt in the wee hours sent Teng 's apartment building listing and caused the fourth floor to collapse entirely .
On the first floor , where Teng ran a medical testing laboratory , a quake - related power outage prevented him from opening the front door .
He then hung a rope out a third - floor window and lowered himself to safety , injuring his hands slightly in the process .
He was n't too worried about the injuries , nor was the destruction of his laboratory a major concern .
He was , however , extremely anxious to save the results of ethnological fieldwork going back nearly two decades .
For Teng , these materials were priceless treasures .
" Luckily , " says Teng , " I managed to get about 80 - 90 % of it out . "
Taiwan 's great melting pot
A Hakka from the township of Puli , Teng was born in 1951 .
Puli and the nearby rural townships of Yuchih , Kuohsing , and Jen'ai comprise an area known as Shuishalien , where many different ethnic groups have always lived side - by - side .
In addition to Fujianese , Cantonese , Hakkas , and the Pingpu aborigines -LRB- various plains - dwelling aboriginal tribes that have almost completely assimilated into the Han Chinese community -RRB- , the area is also home to many mountain - dwelling aboriginal tribes , including the Atayal , Sediq , Bunun , Thao , Perugawan , Pazeh , Taokas , and Murauts .
Although Teng makes his living by running a medical testing lab , a fortunate combination of circumstances has also sparked an abiding interest in ethnology .
Explains Teng , " I grew up listening to the old folks tell stories about the aboriginal tribes .
There was talk about headhunting expeditions and wars .
They used to scare us kids by saying ' The tribesmen will get you ! ' "
He had frequent contact with aborigines , and many of his best friends in school were aborigines .
After graduating from the Department of Medical Laboratory Science at Chungtai Institute of Health Sciences and Technology , he took up an internship at the Puli Christian Hospital , where many of the patients were also aborigines .
In 1974 , Teng opened a medical testing laboratory in Puli .
Besides providing Teng with a livelihood , the lab also brought him into contact with the aborigines , among whom he would make many friends .
Tajik Bawan , a member of the Atayal tribe , first met Teng ten years ago when he visited the lab for a blood test .
Teng 's reputation preceded him , for Bawan had already heard about " the mugan -LRB- Chinese person -RRB- in Puli who knows a lot about us aborigines . "
Self - trained ethnographer
Living in an ethnically complex area like Puli , Teng has always been very aware of ethnic conflict as well as the fusion and disappearance of cultures .
In 1967 Wei Huei - lin , an anthropology professor at Academia Sinica , asked Teng to take him to interview aborigines .
Teng picked up a lot of valuable fieldwork techniques by watching Professor Wei interview the old folks .
Thereafter , whenever he had any spare time he would go visit the aborigines and chat with the old folks .
Teng 's interest in the Wushe Incident of 1930 -LRB- in which members of several aboriginal tribes killed over 100 Japanese people in the village of Wushe and later met with grave retribution from the colonial authorities -RRB- was piqued when his father gave him two documents on the subject .
" After I started taking an active interest in the Wushe Incident in 1981 , people warned me to be careful . "
Many scholars used to steer clear of Taiwan 's colonial history , but Teng happened to take an interest in the subject just as Taiwanese society was beginning to become more liberal .
The fact that Teng was not a member of the academic community was also fortunate , for it freed him of the pressures that academics must deal with .
Says Teng , " This was about the story of my hometown .
I felt that this research simply had to be done . "
Although an amateur in the field of ethnography , Teng is highly regarded in academic circles for his work in recording the oral history of Taiwan 's aborigines .
His good friend Wang Hao , who teaches in junior high school , jokingly calls Teng " the Puli Center for Ethnographic Fieldwork . "
" When I first started doing my fieldwork there were still about 20 survivors of the Wushe Incident , but they 've all passed away now . "
According to Teng , most of the ones lucky enough to survive were extremely reluctant to talk about it , and it took a long time for him to win their trust , but he did succeed eventually .
" I had a couple of factors working in my favor .
Number one , I was n't a government official , and number two , I work in the field of medicine , so they were n't quite so wary of me . "
After starting off with such subjects as religious beliefs and tribal customs , the old folks slowly got to the point where they were willing to break their silence on more sensitive issues .
Teng does his homework
In the field of anthropology , there has been a growing trend in recent years to rely on the results of field studies to check the veracity of historical records .
Teng Hsiang - yang enjoys close relations with the aborigines , which is why researchers and graduate students interested in studying the Austronesian tribes of central Taiwan always come to Puli to seek Teng 's help .
Teng is a frequent participant in research projects focusing on the aboriginal tribes .
For example , in an Academia Sinica study that ran from 1992 to 1996 and focused on the cultural and kinship ties between Taiwan 's nine main aboriginal tribes , Teng helped to study the Thao and the Pazeh -LRB- a plains - dwelling tribe -RRB- .
According to Hsu Mu - chu , a researcher at Academia Sinica 's Institute of Ethnology , " Teng Hsiang - yang 's status as a member of the medical community and his wide contacts among the aborigines enabled him to make a key contribution to the research project . "
If it had n't been for Teng 's detailed knowledge of the kinship ties in some clans , the researchers would never have been able in some cases to identify pure tribal lineages for study .
Says Teng , " The scholars at the Institute of Ethnology have always given me a lot of support . "
Having received so much help , Teng has practically felt an obligation to make it count .
As a medical technician without formal training in ethnology , Teng 's qualifications for doing fieldwork have been questioned by some , but his work is highly regarded among the specialists at the Institute of Ethnology and the Institute of Linguistics , Preparatory Office , two Academia Sinica bodies with which Teng has worked closely .
According to Hsu Mu - chu , " He is very hard working , and his fieldwork methods come very close to what we ask of academic researchers . "
Hsu points out that Teng 's study of the Thao is especially valuable because no one else has done any fieldwork on this tribe since 1958 .
Teng spent six years recording their religious festivals , marriage customs , property ownership system , land development , etc .
In so doing , he has done much to make up for 40 years of neglect .
According to Hsu , the theoretical framework used by anthropologists must be supported by the results of fieldwork , and Teng has done a very thorough job of providing excellent first - hand materials .
Close observation over an extended period of time by local citizens can make up for the shortcomings of academic research .
Teng is in a better position than a professional researcher to engage in long - term observation of the month - long harvest festival of the Thao , for example , because he lives in the local area .
Thus it is that he has been able to record the Thao tribe 's religious festivals over a long period .
This has been very helpful for researchers .
Hsu Mu - chu is now writing a book on the history of the Thao , and is relying heavily on Teng 's work .
Honorary Sediq
In Hsu 's opinion , it is Teng 's deep concern for his fellow human beings that has enabled him to devote so much of himself for such a long time to his fieldwork .
" It is n't every anthropologist , " says Hsu , " who shows this quality . "
This concern for his fellow human beings has earned Teng many friends among the aborigines .
One such friend is a man named Takken -LRB- Chinese name : Teng Chien - tang -RRB- , the great - grandson of a tribal chieftain .
His grandfather and grandmother were survivors of the Wushe Incident , but they had always been unwilling to talk about the past .
Says Takken , " I had never even heard of the Wushe Incident when I was a kid .
It was only after I entered the university that people gradually started talking about it . "
He points out that it is very unusual for someone , purely out of personal interest and concern , to visit old folks in so many tribes and do a systematic study of their history .
" Our ancestors owe him a great debt . "
Says the teacher Tajis Bawan , " Before I met Teng Hsiang - yang , I did n't have a very clear image of who we were as a people , and I had only heard unsubstantiated rumors and snippets about the Wushe Incident . "
Later , however , he was invited to accompany Teng on his trips to interview old folks in the mountains .
These forays were very moving experiences for Bawan .
" Here this man is not even a member of our tribe , yet he has been spending so much time and effort on our behalf .
How can we be content to know nothing about ourselves ? "
With Teng 's encouragement , Bawan started interviewing old folks on his own and recording his tribe 's eating habits , manner of dress , housing , geographic distribution , arts , folk legends , daily life , and other traditions .
At the same time , there are some Atayal people who view Teng with suspicion , saying , " He 's just another plains dweller trying to make money . "
Others have said , " He 's out to become famous . "
Bawan , too , had once harbored such suspicions , but since getting involved in fieldwork himself , he has discovered how quickly the expenses add up for transportation , development of slides , and so much more .
Not only is it not a money - making proposition , it 's actually a drain on one 's personal finances .
As for fame , Bawan asks , " So what if he has become famous ?
It did n't happen overnight .
During the nearly 20 years that he 's devoted himself to his fieldwork , making a name for himself has been the last thing on his mind . "
To thank him for his contributions to their tribe , Teng 's Atayal friends call him " Hiro , " which means " sun " in Sediq .
Bawan simply considers him a member of the Atayal tribe .
" If we are the Atayal nation , then he is an honorary member of the Sediq . "
-LRB- The Sediq are one branch of the Atayal tribe . -RRB-
The Thao have also conferred similar status upon Teng , whom they call " Ita Thao " -LRB- " one of us Thao " -RRB- .
Kudos and criticism
Teng Hsiang - yang has written a number of articles based on his years of fieldwork , including : " Tracing the Origins of Written Language Among the Plains - Dwelling Aborigines of Puli , " " Why the Languages of the Plains - Dwelling Aborigines of the Puli Basin Have Disappeared , " " The Effect Upon the Thao Tribe of Han Chinese Settlement of the Shuishalien Area . "
He has also written several books , including : " The Wushe Incident , " " Thick Fog , Dark Clouds , " and " The Face of the Thao . "
The Wushe Incident , which was selected as one of the ten best books of the year , provides a comprehensive history of the Wushe Incident and includes many valuable historical photos .
With a keen sense of pathos , Teng writes , " Misunderstandings and hatred born of cultural differences and ethnic divisions were the main culprits behind the Wushe Incident . "
In 1993 Teng won the 16th China Times Prize for Nonfiction for Thick Fog , Dark Clouds - Aftermath of the Wushe Incident for an Atayal family .
Thick Fog , Dark Clouds focuses on the life of Yawai Taimo , daughter of an Atayal chieftain .
In connection with the plan of the Japanese colonial authorities to pacify the " barbarians , " Yawai was married off in 1912 to Sazuka Narusuke , the top - ranking police official in Wushe .
Unfortunately for Yawai , the Wushe Incident of 1930 put people from mixed marriages like hers in a complex predicament .
Amidst the burning ethnic tensions of the time , developing a sense of personal identity was especially difficult for the children , who hardly knew whether to consider themselves Japanese , Taiwanese , Atayal , or Chinese .
Thick Fog , Dark Clouds is the story of innocent , helpless victims of Taiwan 's turbulent history .
Li Jen - kuei , director of Academia Sinica 's Institute of Linguistics , Preparatory Office , wrote as follows in the book 's preface :
" Much has been written about the Wushe Incident , but Teng Hsiang - yang is the only one to do it with such depth and feeling . "
Teng , however , feels rather uncomfortable about winning a prize for nonfiction with his very first book .
" It 's not that my writing was all that good .
The story itself is just very compelling . "
After more than ten years of field research , Teng wrote the book -LRB- over 100 pages long -RRB- in just five evenings and then let his friends read the manuscript .
One of his friends , the highly successful nonfiction writer Liao Chia - chan , had only gotten five minutes into the book before exclaiming , " This is going to win literary prizes ! "
Little did he know that his words would prove prophetic .
Says Liao , " A professional writer could never go that long without writing anything , but Teng Hsiang - yang does n't make his living as a writer , and that enabled him to let the book gradually take shape over a long period of time . "
Right after winning the literary prize , however , Teng was hit with a lawsuit by the grandson of Shimoyama Hiroshi and Sazuka Toyoko , two of the people that Teng wrote about in the book .
The suit charges Teng with seven counts of libel .
Puli 's " ambassador to New Zealand "
The lawsuit was just part of a string of misfortunes for Teng .
A nephew taking part in fieldwork fell into Sun Moon Lake and drowned .
Teng 's older sister , who had cared for him when he was growing up , died from cancer .
Deeply dispirited , Teng put his fieldwork aside and moved to New Zealand with his family in 1995 .
The move was greeted with criticism :
" All that talk about his love for Puli was just a put - on . "
Teng , however , responded , " We are moving to New Zealand mainly for our children 's education .
I myself am not leaving Puli .
In fact , I 'll be bringing the best of New Zealand back here with me . "
In his view , there is much that we could learn from New Zealand , including its emphasis on lifelong learning , and its sorted waste collection .
His good friend Wang Hao jokingly calls Teng " Puli 's ambassador to New Zealand . "
On one visit back home , people who had once collaborated in his fieldwork asked him to help formulate a community development project for Puli , and a group that had taken part in his study of the Thao tribe asked him to get back into fieldwork .
And so it was that the gravity of hometown , friends , and the land pulled Teng back to Puli again .
Leaving his wife and children in New Zealand , he returned to Puli to resume his unfinished work .
" I tried to write in New Zealand , but I do n't know whether it was the easy life or the distance .
I just could n't do it . "
Since returning , however , he still has n't been able to concentrate on his writing .
" I 'm too involved in local affairs .
There are more errands and busywork than I have time for . "
According to Wang Hao , personal relationships in a small town like Puli are very close , and anyone with an outspoken personality ends up getting forced into all sorts of civic responsibilities .
Teng happens to be one of the more outspoken types in Puli .
Teng is the first person that many people meet when visiting Puli .
Not long after Li Chia - tung became president of National Chi - Nan University he made it a point to visit Teng Hsiang - yang and Liao Chia - chan to discuss ways to strengthen relations between the university and the local community .
Teng is thus very well known in Puli , and extremely active in community affairs .
The list of projects in which he has been involved is long :
a comprehensive community development project ; an effort to preserve the Tamalin archeological site ; the writing of the section on aboriginal culture in a textbook on native culture in Nantou ; the Puli Music and Arts Festival ; an effort to persuade Academia Sinica to establish a campus in Puli ; etc .
Passing the torch
Teng had originally set himself a goal of getting his tenth book written and published last year .
With a lot of material on hand , and with a lot of the book already written , all he needed to do was add the finishing touches .
Part of the book focuses on the story of Inoue Hajime , a Japanese doctor whose life Teng has been studying for the past ten years .
Says Teng , " After Inoue 's father met his death in Taiwan at the hands of aborigines on a head hunting expedition , Inoue swore to ' avenge ' his father 's death with kindness .
He ended up living 38 years among the aborigines , not even returning to Japan when his mother passed away .
He finally left Taiwan in 1947 .
When I went to Japan last January and paid my respects at his grave , I discovered that his gravestone was inscribed in Atayal .
I used to cry every time I talked about this wonderful doctor , but I 'm getting a little less emotional about it as time goes by .
I have to hurry up and get the book written . "
Teng had been planning to pass the torch to others , both in community affairs and in his efforts to collect the oral histories of the aborigines .
" I 've done my bit , " said Teng , " and soon it will be time to let the aborigines speak for themselves . "
Then the earthquake threw a wrench in Teng 's plans .
After his medical laboratory was destroyed , Teng characteristically reacted by throwing his energies into the task of rebuilding the local community .
He has kept himself busy preparing posters , organizing a community newspaper , and establishing the " New Puli Community Development Foundation . "
Says Teng , " Puli wo n't let me go ! "
The effort to rebuild the community takes precedence over everything else , so it looks like Teng 's writing plans will have to be postponed .
One thing , however , remains certain -
Teng 's love for Puli and the aborigines will never fade .

The Wushe Incident was a taboo subject for many years in the academic community , but Teng Hsiang - yang 's interest was piqued when his father gave him two documents related to the incident .
p. 96
Teng Hsiang - yang , who grew up in Puli at the foot of Mt. Niumien , has become a walking repository of information on the Atayal and Thao tribes as well as the Han - assimilated descendants of various former plains - dwelling aboriginal tribes .
Anyone interested in doing ethnography in this area is sure to seek Teng 's advice .

Thick Fog , Dark Clouds tells the tale of what befell one Atayal family after the Wushe Incident .
The tides of history played a decisive role in the life of Yawai Taimo , who experienced many dramatic and sometimes tragic twists of fate .

Teng Hsiang - yang can often be found at festivals and ceremonies of the Thao tribe , who have come to regard him as one of their own .
p. 101
Teng Hsiang - yang is more than a friend to the aborigines of Puli .
He also has a hand in looking after their health .
The Thao man pictured here , who has long suffered from gout , has come to ask for Teng 's medical advice .

Teng Hsiang - yang 's medical lab and home were destroyed in the September 21 earthquake .
Teng scrambled among the rubble to save his most highly prized possessions - material gathered over the course of years of ethnographic fieldwork .

After his wife and children moved to New Zealand , Teng Hsiang - yang returned alone for an extended stay in Puli , where his only companionship has been a houseful of research materials .
Taiwan Stands Up :
Moving Toward a Brighter Future
Leaders of our friendly nations , distinguished guests and compatriots from Taiwan and abroad ;
This is a glorious moment ; this is also a solemn moment full of hope .
I thank our distinguished guests , who have come here from afar , as well as those friends from around the world who love democracy and care about Taiwan , for sharing this glorious moment with us .
We are here today , not just to celebrate an inauguration , but to witness the flowering of hard - won democratic values and the dawn of a new era .
On the eve of the 21st century , the people of Taiwan have completed a historic alternation of political parties in power .
This is not only the first of its kind in the history of the Republic of China , but also an epochal landmark for Chinese communities around the world .
Taiwan has not only set a new model for the Asian experience of democracy , but has also added an inspiring example to the third wave of democracy the world over .
The election for the 10th - term president of the Republic of China has clearly shown the world that the fruits of freedom and democracy are not easy to come by .
Twenty - three million people , through the power of determined will , have dispelled enmity with love , overcome intimidation with hope , and conquered fear with faith .
With our sacred votes we have proved to the world that freedom and democracy are indisputable universal values , and that peace is humanity 's highest goal .
The outcome of Taiwan 's year 2000 presidential election is not the victory of an individual or a political party .
It is a victory of the people as well as a victory for democracy , because we have , while attracting global attention , transcended fear , threats and oppression and bravely risen to our feet together .
Taiwan stands up , demonstrating a firm insistence on reason and a sturdy faith in democracy .
Taiwan stands up , representing the self - confidence of the people and the dignity of the country .
Taiwan stands up , symbolizing the quest for hope and the realization of dreams .
Dear compatriots , let 's always remember this moment ; let 's always remember to value and feel gratitude for it , because the fruits of democracy did not come out of the blue .
We reaped the fruits only after we had been subjected to many perils and countless hardships .
If not for the fearless sacrifice of our democratic forebears , if not for the unswerving faith of the tens of millions of Taiwanese people in freedom and democracy , we could not possibly be standing on our beloved land today and celebrating a glorious occasion that belongs to all the people .
Today , it is as if we are standing before a fresh new gate of history .
In the process of democratization , the Taiwanese people have created a brand - new key to our shared destiny .
The new century 's gates of hope are soon to open .
We are humble but not submissive .
We are full of self - confidence but do not have the slightest bit of complacence .
Since that moment on March 18 when the election results came to light , I have accepted the mandate of all Taiwanese people in a most earnest and humble frame of mind , and have vowed to devote all my heart , knowledge and courage to assuming the heavy responsibility for our country 's future .
I personally understand that the significance of the alternation of political parties and of the peaceful transition of power lies not in that it is a change of personnel or political parties .
Nor in that it is a dynastic change .
Rather , it is the return of state and government power to the people through a democratic procedure .
The country belongs to the people , rather than to any individual or political party .
The government and its officials , from the head of state down to the rank - and - file employees , exist for the service of the people .
The alternation of political parties does not mean an across - the - board negation of the past .
We should be fair in evaluating the contributions made by those in power throughout the ages .
Mr. Lee Teng - hui deserves our highest tribute and heartfelt gratitude for his promotion of democratic reforms and for his excellent performance during his twelve years of leadership .
Taiwan society has rallied and participated energetically in the election .
Despite the diverse views and stances , all individuals share the same commitment - to come forward for the sake of their political ideas and the country 's future .
We believe that the end of an election is the beginning of reconciliation .
After the curtain falls on emotional campaigns , rationality should prevail .
Under the supreme principles of national interest and the welfare of the people , those in power and in opposition should both fulfill their mandates given by the people and realize the ideals of fair competition in multiparty politics , as well as the checks and balances of democratic politics .
A democratic society with fair competition , tolerance and trust is the strongest impetus for a nation 's development .
Placing national interests above those of political parties , we should solidify the will of the people and seek consensus among the ruling and opposition parties , to promote the country 's progress and reforms .
" A government for all people " and " rule by the clean and upright " are promises I made to the people during the campaign period .
They are also Taiwan 's key to stepping over its fault lines and rising to a higher level in the future .
The spirit of " a government for all people " lies in the fact that " the government exists for the people . "
The people are the masters and shareholders of the state .
The government should rule on the basis of majority public opinion .
The interests of the people should reign supreme over those of any political party or individual .
I have always taken pride in being a member of the Democratic Progressive Party , but from the moment I take my oath and assume the presidency , I will put all my efforts into fulfilling my role as a " president for all people . "
As in the formation of the new government , we recruit people according to their talents and do not discriminate on the basis of ethnicity , gender or party affiliation .
The welfare of the populace shall be our primary goal in the future .
" Rule by the clean and upright " has as its topmost priority the elimination of " black gold " - the involvement of organized crime and moneyed interests in politics - and the eradication of vote - buying .
For a long time , the Taiwanese people have been deeply repelled by moneyed politics and the interference of organized crime .
Vote - buying in grassroots elections has also robbed the people of their right to elect the wise and the able , and tainted the development of Taiwan 's democracy .
Today , I am willing to promise that the new government will eliminate vote - buying and crack down on " black gold " politics , so that Taiwan can rise above such sinking forces and ensure rule by the clean and upright .
We must give the people a clean political environment .
In the area of government reforms , we need to establish a government that is clean , efficient , far - sighted , dynamic , highly flexible and responsive , in order to ensure Taiwan 's competitiveness in the face of increasingly fierce global competition .
The age of " large and capable " governments has now passed , replaced by one of " small and effective " governments , which have established partnership relations with the people .
We should accelerate the streamlining of government functions and organization and actively expand the role of public participation .
This will not only allow the public to fully utilize its energy but also significantly reduce the government 's burdens .
Similar partnership relations should also be set up between the central and local governments .
We want to break the authoritarian and centralized control over both power and money .
We want to realize the spirit of local autonomy , where the local and central governments share resources and responsibilities , where " the central government will not do what the local governments can . "
Whether in the east , west , north or south , whether on Taiwan proper or on offshore islands , all will enjoy balanced , pluralistic development , and the gap between urban and rural areas will be reduced .
We should understand that the government is no panacea for all ills .
The driving force for economic development and societal progress is the people .
Over the past half - century , the Taiwanese people have toiled hard to create an economic miracle that has won global applause , and to lay the foundation for the survival and development of the Republic of China .
Today , facing the impact of fast - changing information technologies and trade liberalization , Taiwan must move toward a knowledge - based economy .
High - tech industries need to be constantly innovative , while traditional ones have to undergo transformation and upgrading .
In the future , the government should not necessarily play the role of a " leader " or " manager . "
On the contrary , it should be the " supporter " and " service provider , " as expected by private enterprises .
The responsibility of a modern government is to raise administrative efficiency , improve the domestic investment environment , and maintain financial order and stock market stability , so as to allow the economy to move toward full liberalization and globalization through fair competition .
Based on these principles , the vitality of the public will naturally bloom and create a new phase in Taiwan 's economic miracle .
Apart from consolidating democratic achievements , promoting government reforms , and raising economic competitiveness , the new government should , as its foremost objective , closely watch public opinion and implement reforms accordingly , so that the people on this land can live with more dignity , greater self - confidence and a better quality of life .
Let our society not only be safe , harmonious and prosperous , but also follow the principles of fairness and justice .
As we cultivate the ever - growing abilities of our citizens , we will let our next generation learn in an environment filled with happiness and hope .
The 21st century will be a time when " the right to a quality life " and " a refined way of life " are much emphasized .
The government will find solutions for issues relating to the people 's lives , such as law and order , social welfare , environmental protection , land - use planning , waste disposal , river cleaning , transportation and community renewal .
It will also have to implement these solutions thoroughly .
At present , we need to immediately improve law and order and environmental protection , two important indicators of the quality of life .
We will build a new social order so that the people may live in peace without fear .
A balance must be ensured between nature conservation and economic development so that Taiwan may develop into a sustainable green silicon island .
Judicial integrity is the bulwark of political democracy and social justice .
An impartial , independent judiciary is a protector of social order and a defender of the people 's rights .
At present , we still have a long way to go in our judicial reforms .
Our compatriots must continue to keep close watch over the judiciary and voice their expectations .
At the same time , we should also restrain our administrative power and give the judiciary room to operate independently and without interference .
Humans are Taiwan 's most important resources .
Talented people hold the key to the country 's competitiveness , while education is the long - term cause underpinning " accumulating wealth among the people . "
We will soon seek a consensus among the ruling and opposition parties , academia and the public so as to carry on with educational reforms and build a healthy , proactive , lively and innovative educational system , which will allow Taiwan to cultivate an uninterrupted stream of top - notch talents amid the fierce international competition .
We will let Taiwan move gradually toward being a " learning organism " and a " knowledge - based society . "
We will also encourage people to take up lifetime learning to fully develop their potential and creativity .
Grassroots community organizations are now developing around the country , working to explore and preserve the history , culture , geography and ecology of their localities .
These are all part of Taiwan culture , whether they are local cultures , mass cultures or high cultures .
Due to special historical and geographical factors , Taiwan possesses a wealth of diversified cultural elements .
But cultural development is not something that can bring immediate success .
Rather , it has to be accumulated bit by bit .
We must open our hearts with tolerance and respect , so that our diverse ethnic groups and different regional cultures may communicate with each other , and so that Taiwan 's local cultures may connect with the cultures of Chinese - speaking communities and other world cultures , and create a new milieu of " a cultural Taiwan in a modern century . "
The September 21 earthquake that struck last year brought to our land and our compatriots an unprecedented catastrophe , the pain of which is yet to heal .
The new government will brook no delay in the reconstruction of disaster areas , including industrial and spiritual recovery .
We will not cease until the last victim is taken care of and the last destroyed place is rebuilt .
Here , we would like to express our highest respect again for all individuals and nongovernmental organizations that have selflessly lent a hand to the rescue and reconstruction work after the disaster .
Amid the fierce power of Nature , we have seen Taiwan 's most beautiful compassion , strongest faith and greatest trust .
Our compatriots have been injured by the September 21 earthquake , but with the spirit of a " volunteer Taiwan , " Taiwan 's new family will stand up resolutely on its feet once again .
Dear compatriots , 400 years ago Taiwan was called " Ihla Formosa " - the beautiful island - for its lustrous landscape .
Today , Taiwan is manifesting the elegance of a democratic island , once again attracting global attention , as the people on this land create a new page in our history .
We believe that the Republic of China , with its democratic achievements and technological and economic prowess , can certainly continue to play an indispensable role in the international community .
In addition to strengthening the existing relations with friendly nations , we want to actively participate in all types of international nongovernmental organizations .
Through humanitarian care , economic cooperation , cultural exchanges and various other ways , we will actively participate in international affairs , expand Taiwan 's room for survival in the international arena , and contribute to the welfare of the international community .
Besides , we are also willing to commit to a more active contribution in safeguarding international human rights .
The Republic of China can not and will not remain outside global human rights trends .
We will abide by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Convention for Civil and Political Rights , and the Vienna Declaration and Program of Action .
We will bring the Republic of China back into the international human rights system .
The new government will urge the Legislative Yuan to ratify the International Bill of Rights as a domestic law of Taiwan , so that it will formally become the " Taiwan Bill of Rights . "
We hope to set up an independent national human rights commission in Taiwan , thereby realizing an action long advocated by the United Nations .
We will also invite two outstanding nongovernmental organizations , the International Commission of Jurists and Amnesty International , to assist us in our measures to protect human rights and make the Republic of China into a new indicator for human rights in the 21st century .
We firmly believe that at no time , nor in any corner of the world , can the meaning and values of freedom , democracy and human rights be ignored or changed .
The 20th century left us with a major lesson - that war is a failure of humanity .
Waged for whatever lofty purposes or high - sounding reasons , war is the greatest harm to freedom , democracy and human rights .
Over the past one hundred plus years , China has suffered imperialist aggression , which left indelible wounds .
Taiwan has had an even sadder fate , tormented by brute force and colonial rule .
These similar historical experiences should bring mutual understanding between the people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait , setting a solid foundation for pursuing freedom , democracy and human rights together .
However , due to the long period of separation , the two sides have developed vastly different political systems and ways of life , obstructing empathy and friendship between the people on the two sides , and even creating a wall of divisiveness and confrontation .
Today , as the Cold War has ended , it is time for the two sides to cast aside the hostility left from the old era .
We do not need to wait further because there is a new opportunity now for the two sides to create an era of reconciliation together .
The people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait share the same ancestral , cultural , and historical background .
While upholding the principles of democracy and parity , building upon the existing foundations , and constructing conditions for cooperation through good will , we believe that the leaders on both sides possess enough wisdom and creativity to jointly deal with the question of a future " one China . "
I fully understand that , as the popularly elected 10th - term president of the Republic of China , I must abide by the Constitution , maintain the sovereignty , dignity and security of our country , and ensure the well - being of all citizens .
Therefore , as long as the CCP regime has no intention to use military force against Taiwan , I pledge that during my term in office , I will not declare independence , I will not change the national title , I will not push forth the inclusion of the so - called " state - to - state " description in the Constitution , and I will not promote a referendum to change the status quo in regard to the question of independence or unification .
Furthermore , there is no question of abolishing the Guidelines for National Unification and the National Unification Council .
History has proved that war will lead to more hatred and enmity , without the least help to the development of mutual relations .
Chinese people emphasize the difference between statesmanship and hegemony , believing in the philosophy that a government which employs benevolence " will please those near and appeal to those from afar , " and " when those from afar will not submit , then one must practice kindness and virtue to attract them . "
Such Chinese wisdom will remain a universal value .
Under the leadership of Mr. Deng Xiaoping and Mr. Jiang Zemin , the mainland has created a miracle of economic openness .
In Taiwan , over a half century , not only have we created a miracle economy , we have also created the political marvel of democracy .
On such a basis , as long as the governments and people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can interact more , following the principles of " goodwill reconciliation , active cooperation , and permanent peace , " while at the same time respecting the free choice of the people and excluding unnecessary obstacles , both sides of the Strait can make great contributions to the prosperity and stability of the Asia - Pacific region .
Both sides will also create a glorious civilization for humanity .
Dear compatriots , we hope so much to share the moving scene of this moment with all Chinese - speaking people around the world .
The wide Ketagelan Boulevard before us was bristling with security guards only a few years ago .
The building behind me used to be the Governor General 's Mansion during the colonial era .
Today , we gather here to extol the glory and joy of democracy with songs of the land and the voice of the people .
With a little reflection , our compatriots should be able to appreciate the deep and far - reaching meaning of this moment :
Authoritarianism and force can only bring surrender for one time , while democracy and freedom are values that will endure forever .
Only by adhering to the will of the people can we pioneer the paths of history and build enduring architecture .
Today , as the son of a tenant farmer with a poor family background , I have struggled and grown on this land and , after experiencing defeat and tribulation , I have finally won the trust of the people to take up the great responsibility of leading the country .
My individual achievements are minor , but the message is valuable because each citizen of Formosa is a " child of Taiwan " just like me .
In whatever difficult environment , Taiwan will be like a selfless , loving mother , who never stops giving her children opportunities and who helps them realize beautiful dreams .
The spirit of the " child of Taiwan " reveals to us that even though Taiwan , Penghu , Kinmen and Matsu are tiny islands on the rim of the Pacific , the map of our dreams knows no limits .
The map extends all the way to the horizon as long as our 23 million compatriots fear no hardship and move forward hand in hand .
Dear compatriots , this magnificent moment belongs to all the people .
All grace and glory belongs to Taiwan - our eternal Mother .
Together , let 's extend our gratitude to the earth and our respect to the people .
Long live freedom and democracy !
Long live the people of Taiwan !
We pray for the prosperity of the Republic of China , and for the health and happiness of all compatriots and all our distinguished guests !

Nuclear - Free Dream Recedes Amid Inter-Branch Conflict
-LRB- Alexandra Liu / tr. by Robert Taylor -RRB-
Having dragged on since 27 October last year , the furore over the cancellation of the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant project was briefly laid to rest on 13 February 2001 , when Premier Chang Chun - hsiung and Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin - pyng signed an agreement to resume construction of the plant .
However , the controversy over the plant was soon put back in the spotlight by calls for a plebiscite on the issue .
On one side of the argument is the unquenchable thirst for economic advance ; on the other , the long - term ideal of a nuclear - free homeland , and the distress of the people of Kungliao , where the plant is sited .
Standing at the nuclear crossroads , buffeted by the waves of political turmoil sparked by the project , how should Taiwan choose its road for the future ?
On 14 February , in a statement in which he spoke of a " painful choice " and his " undying determination , " Premier Chang Chun - hsiung announced the resumption of work on the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant , and identified the passing of a plebiscite law as the most important topic for renewed cross-party consultation .
He also responded positively to the Legislative Yuan 's indication of its support for the goal of a " nuclear - free homeland . "
With the words : " Developments over the coming ten months will decide Taiwan 's fate for the next 10,000 years , " Chang hinted that the next stage in the antinuclear campaign will be a decisive factor in the Legislative Yuan elections scheduled for the end of the year .
The same day , the cabinet approved the plan to resume construction of the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant , and announced that it would formulate a plan for the phased closure and decommissioning of the three existing nuclear plants , on condition that adequate electricity generating capacity is maintained .
