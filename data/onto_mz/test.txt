The enterovirus detection biochip developed by DR. Chip Biotechnology takes only six hours to give hospitals the answer to whether a sample contains enterovirus , and if it is the deadly strain Entero 71 .
Worldwide , biotechnology is a rising star of the industrial stage .
In Taiwan , in recent years the Ministry of Economic Affairs , the National Science Council and the National Health Research Institutes have been strongly pursuing " biochip " research programs .
In the last two years , three biochip companies have also been set up in Taiwan .
Just what are biochips ?
What use are they to mankind ?
Why do so many people have such confidence in their future ?
What is the current state of this field in Taiwan ?
And what are the prospects for future development ?
Let 's take a closer look .
In just a few years ' time , or a few decades , the following scenario could become a reality :
When you 're feeling under the weather , all you need to do is buy a diagnostic biochip from the chemist 's shop , put a drop of urine onto it , and you will find out what is wrong with you - a health check will be as easy as a pregnancy test today .
Everyone will carry with them a biochip bearing a record and analysis of their own DNA .
From it one will not only be able to see one 's own physical condition , but even to predict what diseases one will have in the future .
It will be like an ID card , needed when looking for work , buying insurance or even seeking a partner for love and marriage .
Laboratories will no longer need all kinds of large instruments , for all stages of their experiments will be carried out on little biochips , saving time , effort and money .
Today , the scenes outlined above may just seem like pipe dreams .
But these dreams could yet come true , and the key to that happening is those little biochips .
A dream come true ?
Developments such as the sequencing of the human genome and the rapid development of genetic engineering have spawned biotechnology industries like bioinformatics , biomaterials and pharmaceutical engineering , which have emerged as the rising stars of 21st - century industry .
As part of the government 's efforts to promote the biotechnology industry in Taiwan , in July 1999 the Industrial Technology Research Institute -LRB- ITRI -RRB- set up the Biomedical Engineering Center -LRB- BMEC -RRB- to actively develop biomedical engineering technologies .
Biochips are one of the core technologies in the field .
BMEC general director Dr. Johnsee Lee says that the ITRI 's four - year R&D program in biochip applications and technology is now in its second year .
Its initial objectives are mainly focused on developing sensor chips to screen for infectious diseases , while later goals will be to develop technologies to test for genetic diseases and cancers .
As well as this new research establishment , in the two years since September 1998 three commercial companies have been set up in Taiwan to make biochips : U - Vision Biotech , Taiwan Genome Sciences and DR. Chip Biotechnology .
Of these , DR. Chip attracted much attention this year when it developed a chip to detect enteroviruses , a deadly epidemic of which has gripped Taiwan over the last two years .
Fever chips
DR. Chip Bio-technology was set up in September 1998 .
Vice president Wang Shin - hwan states that the company successfully applied to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for funding to help it pursue a development program for enterovirus detection chips and test technology .
Today , the enterovirus chip is in the testing phase , and DR. Chip is collaborating with Taipei Veterans General Hospital to obtain samples with which to establish the accuracy of the chip .
What is so remarkable about the enterovirus detection chip when compared with traditional test methods ?
There are 68 known forms of non-polio enterovirus .
The detection chip does not simply determine whether a person is infected with enterovirus , but can also differentiate between different virus groups , for instance showing whether a sample contains the deadly Entero 71 virus , or Coxsackie A16 , which is easily confused with Entero 71 .
In addition , the chip and its accompanying PCR kit greatly reduce the time required for testing .
Wang Shin - hwan notes that traditional bacterial and viral cultures take seven to ten days to prepare , and even with the newer molecular biology testing techniques it takes three days to get a result .
But DR. Chip has developed methods to reduce the sample preparation time , which enables a result to be obtained in only six hours when used in combination with their enterovirus chip .
Furthermore , the initial results of joint trials by DR. Chip , Chang Gung University and National Cheng Kung University suggest that the chip is over a thousand times more sensitive than traditional test methods .
" In addition to enterovirus , we plan to develop chips to detect other infectious diseases such as hepatitis B , hepatitis C and HIV , " says Wang Shin - hwan .
Apart from the enterovirus chip , which is already at the testing stage , the ITRI 's Molecular Biomedical Technology Division is also conducting research and development on biochip applications and technology .
Research program director Pan Chao - chi states that at present they are actively developing a " fever chip " with a wide range of applications .
Pan explains that in clinical practice , the causes of fever are difficult to quickly diagnose .
A " fever chip " bearing the DNA of common fever - causing viruses and bacteria could be used to determine the cause of the fever and the type of pathogen involved would be a valuable tool .
However , Pan points out that because of the difficulties in substantially reducing the time needed for sample preparation , the usefulness of such a fever chip is still limited , so that it can not yet be widely promoted .
Where the real money is
At present , most applications for biochips are in academic research and the development of new pharmaceutical drugs .
Demand for them is growing rapidly .
Johnsee Lee says that according to US market research estimates , the worldwide annual consumption of microarray chips is currently around 250,000 ; in two years this is expected to grow to 1.2 million .
Based on a market price per chip of US$ 1,000 , the size of the world market in biochips could grow to US$ 1.2 billion in 2003 , and to US$ 40 billion over the next decade .
Thus some people have set their sights on the biochip market , and believe that following Taiwan 's success in the semiconductor field , the island could go on to be a major center for contract manufacture of biochips .
Be that as it may , the small number of biochip companies so far established in Taiwan still find their market in domestic research establishments and pharmaceuticals manufacturers .
Although they are also actively developing overseas markets , what interests them most is not biochips per se , nor are they content merely to be contract manufacturers .
" The chips are only a tool , and the big money is not in chip sales .
What counts is the R&D behind them . "
Jerry Huang , executive vice president of U - Vision Biotech , reveals that U - Vision , which was set up in September 1999 , has signed a contract with the US company Zen - Bio to jointly develop human adipocyte cDNA microarray chips .
Huang states that research in recent years has revealed that adipocytes -LRB- fat cells -RRB- are active regulators of the energy balance in the body , and play an important role in disorders such as obesity , diabetes , osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease .
Thus it is hoped that research into human adipocytes can help in the search for drugs and other therapies to treat these disorders .
Apart from this , U - Vision is also conducting a one - year bacterial genome project , which aims to map the genome of a certain drug - resistant bacterium as a basis for developing new vaccines and drugs .
Drug development
Taiwan Genome Sciences -LRB- TGS -RRB- , which was set up in November 1999 as a joint venture by the Uni-President Enterprises Group , Yuen Foong Yu and Tuntex Groups , only entered the biotechnology fray in April of this year .
CEO Andrew Kuo says the investors came to the view that Taiwan needs to develop its biotechnology industries , and therefore they combined their resources to make a long - term investment in the field .
TGS 's strategy is to invest in a number of US genome research companies , and to sign technology transfer agreements and chip production contracts with them .
Kuo comments that contract production of chips is merely a service activity and a source of income for the company - TGS 's ultimate goal is in doing R&D work to identify gene sequences as targets for developing new drugs .
Kuo states that at present , the number of known target sequences for disease - treating drugs is only around 500 , but as the human genome is mapped out this number can be expected to increase tenfold .
Currently , TGS has its sights set mainly on doing research into diseases which are especially prevalent in Asia , such as liver and stomach cancers .
A chip revolution
However , the potential uses for biochips go far beyond the medical applications outlined above .
Dr. Johnsee Lee , who as well as heading up the Biomedical Engineering Center is also general director of Union Chemical Laboratories , a research institute under the ITRI umbrella , says that due to biochips ' advantages of miniaturization , parallelism , speed and the ability to reveal the " big picture , " they have a very wide range of applications .
They can not only be used as a research tool in biological , medical and pharmaceutical research and development , and as a clinical diagnostic tool for doing health checks , testing for infectious pathogens , screening blood and so on , but they can also find uses in such areas as defense applications , police forensic work , environmental testing and food testing .
Biochips come in two main types : the microfluidics chip or " lab - on - a - chip , " and the microarray chip or " DNA chip . "
Microfluidics chips bring together biotechnology , microelectronics , micromachining and other technologies to integrate the functions of multiple laboratory instruments onto a single chip in miniaturized form .
Meanwhile on microarray chips , biological molecules such as gene segments , oligonucleotides , proteins or antibodies are bound to the chip surface in an array of tiny spots , and a single chip may carry many tens of thousands of such spots .
BMEC researcher Pan Chao - chi uses the example of blood screening for a blood bank to illustrate the difference between the two kinds of chips .
To test a blood sample using a microarray chip , the sample must first go through many preparatory steps such as purification , nucleotide extraction , copying , amplification and labeling before being put onto the chip where the " hybridization " reaction takes place .
Finally , the results are analyzed using a detection system .
Hence these chips are only suitable for use in the laboratory .
In contrast , with a lab - on - a - chip system , all the laboratory preparation stages will be done on the chip itself , so that the user need only place a drop of blood directly onto the chip to obtain a result .
At present , microfluidics technology is not yet mature , and no such chips have been launched as commercial products anywhere .
But , says Pan Chao - chih : " This is the way future biochip development will go . "
The poor man 's chip
Future prospects also seem infinite for microarray chips , which are already widely used in laboratories and research establishments .
Jerry Huang notes that DNA chips are an indispensable research tool in molecular biology .
On one little biochip , tens of thousands of gene segments can be arranged to simultaneously detect the expression of tens of thousands of genes .
In other words , whereas in the past researchers had to investigate each gene individually , today , using biochips , they can obtain test results for tens of thousands of genes at once .
In particular , biochips not only can speed the pace of research , but can also replace laboratory animals such as rats and rabbits in many experiments , with tests being carried out directly on human genes on the chip .
Thus as research tools biochips are not only convenient and quick , but also more humane .
Dr. Konan Peck , an assistant research fellow at Academia Sinica 's Institute of Biomedical Sciences -LRB- IBMS -RRB- , says that biochips need to be made more widely available as a molecular biology research tool .
With this in mind , Peck has developed nylon - based biochips which have been called " the poor man 's biochip , " since they cost a third less than glass chips .
Apart from the material itself being cheaper , the nylon chips use a visible - spectrum colorimetric system to display results , so that they can be read using an ordinary optical scanner , which costs 50 - 70 % less than using a special laser detector .
The nylon membrane biochips currently produced by TGS and U - Vision Biotech are all derived from the technology developed by Konan Peck .
Cutting edge
Can Taiwan really repeat its success in the semiconductor industry , to become a major production center for biochips ?
BMEC director Johnsee Lee observes that the level of scientific and technical know - how required for biochip production is very high , so that the opportunities for contract manufacture are limited .
However , due to Taiwan 's early entry into biochip research and development , and the high state of development of its semiconductor industry , the island is well supplied with relevant technology and skills .
Thus , says Lee , " Taiwan should have opportunities to enter this field not merely as a contract manufacturer . "
The potential and importance of biochips is plain to see , but in this new , interdisciplinary industry , there are still many obstacles and difficulties to overcome .
Apart from the fact that the technology is not yet mature , and that generally accepted , mutually compatible international standards have not yet emerged , the biggest bottleneck for biochips at the moment is the many thousands of patents which have been taken out in the field , which limit the avenues available to each player .
" Because this area is a patents minefield , it 's impossible to create a product which from start to finish does n't infringe on anyone else 's patents , " says Johnsee Lee .
In his view , this problem may be resolved in the future by the exchange of patented technologies between players .
In other words , at this stage companies must actively carry out research and development , and obtain international patents , in order to have bargaining chips in future negotiations .
At present , the BMEC has over 10 patents pending in the areas of microfluidics biochips , chip surface processing technology and probe design and applications .
Pushing the envelope
Although at their present stage of development , biochips are already a great help to researchers , they are still far removed from ordinary people 's lives .
But one day they will play an important role in all our lives .
" Applications and commercialization are our goal , " says Johnsee Lee .
He says that only if research results are commercialized does research produce an economic payback .
Equally , to have a really broad market biochips need to go beyond the laboratory researcher , and into hospitals , clinics and homes , and to individual users .
Lee points out that before biochips will be worth commercializing , sample preparation needs to be made convenient , reading results must be simple and easy , the chips ' speed and accuracy must be high , and their cost must be low .
He predicts that in one to two years , biochips will be suitable for use in supplemental tests , and after around three years for high - throughput screening ; in five years time it should be possible to develop them into general screening tools which will be as easy to use as the pregnancy test kits on the market today .
IBMS associate research fellow Konan Peck agrees that in the foreseeable future , diagnostic chips will enable everyone to learn their current state of health and know what diseases they may develop in the future .
But in a situation where testing technology is ahead of medical treatment technology , the medical problems so discovered may not be treatable .
Mankind is always challenging his limits , and when , in the near future , biochips lift the veil of many diseases , the next challenge will have only just begun .
Genteel Journalis --
Thomas Lu
-LRB- Eric Lin / tr. by Robert Taylor -RRB-
Thomas Lu is the doyen of the Chinese news media .
Still out on the journalistic front lines at 81 , this spry , forthright veteran has an immense zest for life .
At 78 , drawing on his astonishingly sharp memory , he completed his reminiscences and " record of emotional regrets . "
He is not only one of the " wonders " of Taiwan 's journalistic world , but is also recognized by those of his generation as a gentleman and a " good - looking man . "
A person 's looks change with their age and their state of mind .
Many friends have told me I look better the older I get .
People do n't know that when I was young I had dreadful protruding teeth , but now not only do my teeth no longer show , but the lines of my face have also softened .
People who know me know that there have always been two great loves in my life : the news , and women .
Now that I 'm in my 80s , looking back I think I can say I 've done alright in both respects , and I 've learnt that both reporting the news well , and finding favor with women , depend on your character and conduct .
Journalism is not just a profession , but should also be a vocation - you have to throw yourself fully into this infinitely broad field of endeavor .
Intellectually and spiritually , in work and in love , I have gained experience and fulfilment .
I have always remembered the encouragement which Mr. Yu Youren gave me as a young reporter .
He said that to be a fearless champion of social justice , as is expected of a journalist , the most important thing , apart from energy and vitality , is modesty .
You have to treat everybody the same , and not be overawed by the great and powerful .
A president or a street sweeper deserve the same respect as a human being , and should both be treated the same way .
Funnily enough , an unassuming attitude is also advantageous in relations with the opposite sex .
Chinese society is male dominated , and women are mostly regarded as having a subsidiary role .
In this kind of unfair situation , an upstanding man should cherish and respect women all the more .
A considerate attitude can be expressed in little things .
For instance , when you see that a hair has fallen onto a female friend 's shoulder , you should lightly pick it off for her , and throw it away or put it in your pocket .
If sincere , this kind of action is attractive in a man .
If a woman expresses her liking for you , then no matter whether she is pretty , or whether you find her attractive , you should respond in the same way , and with the same respect .
When I was a young reporter stationed in Europe , there was a British woman reporter who liked me very much .
Once I was driving her somewhere to report a story when we had an accident , and she suffered some badly broken bones .
Although I was n't attracted to her in that way , I went to see her every day in hospital , and this left a deep impression on her of how considerate Chinese men can be .
Looking back at my life , I 've hardly had any really bad experiences in my relationships with women , and this is because just as in my professional life , I 've always maintained a self - critical attitude towards my emotions , and always tried to prevent myself acting like a male chauvinist .
Looks are something you are born with , but character is something you can work on , and it can outweigh your appearance .
Luo Jialun , one of the leading lights of the May Fourth Movement , is a famous example .
Luo was not good looking , and was even ridiculed as " looking like a cross between a pig , a dog and a bear . "
But he was tremendously well - read , had a beautiful writing style , and for a time he was Chinese ambassador to India .
His wife was a universally admired beauty , the envy of all .
So I say , " handsome is as handsome does . "
I was imprisoned by both the Kuomintang and the Communists , and at times I might have been killed .
Perhaps other people in the same situation might have wallowed in self - pity , but I saw it as a rare opportunity in life .
In 1951 , in a dark prison cell during a big Communist purge , what came into my mind was not fear of death .
Instead , I wondered what kind of headline my death would merit in the newspapers .
" 10,000 Rush to See Lu Executed " ?
Perhaps it was this eternal optimism which changed my frame of mind and my appearance .
This is the advice I 'd like to give young people :
it 's true that good looks can come from external grooming , wearing nice clothes , or wearing earrings ; and perhaps you can get other people 's attention by creating your own special look .
But do n't overdo it .
It is appropriate dress , and a temperament developed through study and practice , which really make a man attractive .
Tanshui : An Inspiration to Poets , Artists , and Romantics
-LRB- Lin I - hsien / photos by Diago Chiu / tr. by Phil Newell -RRB-
In paintings , a white cloud layer swirls over Mt. Kuanyin ;
waves on the river drift like a breeze ;
a red sun dances on golden water ;
a yellow moon sings from a deep purple sky . . . .
The Tanshui of illustrations is a place of unblemished beauty , a myth that remains unshakeable .
In the 300 - plus years since its founding , this port town - formerly called Huwei , now Tanshui Township - has seen days of prosperity and has also been through a baptism of fire .
What makes it special among the 309 urban and rural townships of Taiwan ?
How do the people of Tanshui live today ?
How do they recall the past ?
And how do they see the future ?
" You want to know how Tanshui has changed ?
I would say that the biggest change is that the old streets are gone . "
So declares Tu Hsiu - yuan , proprietor of the Hui Yuan Pharmacy , and also director of the Huwei Cultural and Historical Workshop .
His pharmacy is located on what is now called Chungcheng Road , one of the oldest streets , which Tanshui natives still call Huwei Street .
Tu , who has lived his whole life in the old neighborhood , has watched from his doorstep as old shops have refurbished themselves in modern style , and modern shops have adopted the look of the old .
For the convenience of cars , the streets have been widened repeatedly .
In 1988 , the last train on the old Tanshui Line of the railroad chugged into history , taking that old slower pace of life with it .
In 1997 the Tanshui Line of the mass rapid transit system opened , bringing floods of visitors to the town .
Yet , while these tourists bring a human touch to the streets on weekends and holidays , on ordinary weekdays the silence is accompanied only by leftover garbage , empty shops , and those Huwei people who refuse to leave their old homes .
The golden age of Huwei
There are different explanations as to the origins of the word Huwei , the original name for Tanshui .
Some say it was a transliteration of the place name used by the indigenous people .
But others say it comes from a long - gone fishing practice , using a shi hu -LRB- " stone pool " -RRB- .
Early fishermen used stones to carve a long , narrow catchment -LRB- the so - called " pool " -RRB- in the sand , waiting for the tide to carry in fish which they could then easily scoop up .
Since the place now known as Tanshui was at the tail end -LRB- wei -RRB- of this stone pool , it came to be called Huwei .
Tanshui occupied an important place in the transport network connecting Taiwan to Southeast Asia .
Even before the arrival of Westerners in Taiwan , Han Chinese often crossed over from China to Tanshui , which is relatively close to the mainland .
Here they engaged in barter trade with the Pingpu -LRB- meaning " plains " -RRB- aborigines , with deer skins and sulphur being the most coveted products .
As Western powers turned their eyes to Asia , Tanshui became strategically important .
In the 17th century , first the Spanish , and then the Dutch , built forts here as symbols of their claims to territorial control .
In the mid-17th century , China took control of Taiwan , and closed Tanshui to international trade .
Later , as a result of the Sino - French war of 1884 , Tanshui was again opened up to Western access .
During Tanshui 's golden age , large and small boats were constantly coming and going in the harbor , and it was not unusual to see enormous steamships .
In the latter part of the Qing dynasty , Tanshui was the largest port in Taiwan , and was the " customs headquarters , " also charged with overseeing port activities at Keelung , Tainan , and Kaohsiung .
However , during the Japanese occupation , as a result of silting , and because the Japanese invested a huge effort in developing the port at Keelung , Tanshui faded in importance , never again to see the likes of its glory days .
Tanshui is a place of many historic sites , a place that invites reflection on things past .
In the " foreign district , " a missionary named George Mackay established the first hospital for Western medicine in Taiwan ; it was here that in 1878 the first case of paragonimiasis in the world was diagnosed .
The old church next to the hospital is a mecca for Tanshui painters .
The schools , homes , and consulates in the foreign district - some long gone , some still standing - testify to the fact that this was a place of intensive interaction between Chinese and Western cultures .
If you go up Sanmin Street , you will discover the head of an old and disused water pipe .
This could be a relic left behind by one of the major Japanese infrastructure projects , the first tap water station .
Or you could walk instead next to the MRT station and see another first for Taiwan : the first seaplane landing area , also built in the Japanese occupation era .
Or you could visit the venerable Tamkang Secondary School .
As you watch the children laughing and arguing and playing , you can think back to the time when the Japanese government did not allow Taiwanese and Japanese to attend school together .
Under those circumstances , Tamkang Middle School became a cradle for the training of Taiwanese elites .
Gradually you will discover that Tanshui is a bookish place .
This little town has everything from nursery schools to graduate schools .
During the reign of the Guangxu emperor of the Qing dynasty -LRB- which began in 1875 -RRB- , and prior to the beginning of the Japanese occupation in 1895 , Tanshui produced two successful candidates in the highest level military exam , one in the highest level civil exam , and countless successes in lower - level imperial exams .
Even in modern times , the town has not passed up chances to embrace knowledge : When the idea of founding Tam - kang University in Tanshui was going to be abandoned because of a lack of land and money , local residents offered cheap land , donated money , and lobbied so that the university could set its roots in town .
These historic sites are near the river , but do n't spend all your time there .
Do n't forget the Tatun Mountains , which shelter the town .
In the old days , Tanshui folk who cultivated farms on the slopes had to walk for an hour to get to their crops .
These days you can take a local mini-bus .
In the mountains you will see the occasional terraced field grown over with weeds .
This land , which has gone from grass to grain and back to grass again , is where many an old Tanshui native played when they were children .
The Tanshui mystique
The mountains are also filled with old stories .
The often - renovated Hsing Chung Tang shop is more than a century old .
Owner Li Yung - kun is a descendant of the eminent Li family of Tanshui , which produced three juren -LRB- a successful candidate in provincial - level exams , held every three years -RRB- .
The house testifies to this past : It has a swallow - tailed roof and a flagpole , features that only the home of a juren was entitled to have .
Li Mingbin -LRB- whose name by birth is Li Minghui -RRB- , a scholar from Beijing University currently working at Chinese Culture University on an exchange program , is a descendant of the juren Li Yingzhen , who was wounded resisting the Japanese occupation and fled to the mainland , where he settled down .
Like his elders , Li Mingbin bridges the gap across the Taiwan Strait , as he is capable of conversing fluently in either Beijing dialect or the southern Fujian dialect used in Taiwan .
Of course , stories do n't have to be old to be interesting .
Today 's Tanshui residents are living their own stories .
The crotchety but modest guy who delivers the newspapers , the seafood restaurant owner who has made his fortune from scratch , the old man at the roadside food stall , the hostess in the tea house greeting and sending off guests . . . .
Some are active in the early morning , some late at night .
Though the founders of many of these shops have passed away , the second generation has taken the baton .
In the old bamboo tea shop , the now elderly hostess still plays her role amidst the ambience of wine and tea , offering a feminine presence to help put at ease her customers who come looking for a little relaxation , evoking the bewitching atmosphere of Tanshui at night .
Businessmen from outside , smelling profits , have set up gaudy storefronts and neon signs , hoping to trade on Tanshui 's mystique to sell coffee , seafood , antiques , and snack foods .
Students , who have enough money to keep several streets of shops going , carelessly wheel their motorcycles through the narrow streets , their minds elsewhere , thinking of youthful fun or romance .
Happy couples and jilted lovers line the river , displaying their joy or sadness in their postures : two people 's shadows are melted together by the darkened river behind , while others stand alone on the riverbank like statues .
The weeping river
Have you heard of the weeping junks ?
During the Sino - French war , Taiwan governor Liu Mingchuan , attempting to obstruct a French landing , scuttled several of these boats .
It is said that , late at night , the sunken junks make moaning sounds .
But I think that it may be the river itself that is moaning .
In 1998 , the government produced a plan for a riverside expressway to Tanshui .
The road , which was expected to have three levels , would have cut through rare mangroves and created a barrier between the river and the town of Tanshui .
If the plan had been implemented , people who wanted to go to Tanshui and gaze out over the river would have had to find some very high vantage point in town to do so !
Fortunately , thanks to efforts by cultural and environmental activists from Tanshui , the plan was first postponed , and then was ultimately killed after an environmental impact assessment released in September refused to approve the scheme .
But a question remains : Is something like this bound to come sooner or later ?
" For the purposes of development , the Tanshui coast has been constantly exploited .
But what will be result of this incessant struggle against nature ? " says an agitated Tu Hsiu - yuan .
And Hsieh Teh - hsi of the Tamsui Culture Foundation adds : " High - rises are going up one after another in Tanshui New Town [ a huge government - planned development ] , but many of the apartments remain empty .
Everybody here knows that when the northeast winds blow in during the winter , that is the coldest place around .
No wonder those apartments are not selling ! "
Tu says , with disbelief and exasperation in his voice : " Do you know that they are going to build a huge bridge between Tanshui and Pali ?
It 's such a beautiful and historic location , but they are just going to stick up a bridge there , and they are even talking about having a rotating restaurant on top ! "
Lovers of Tanshui , while keeping close watch over her , are fearful that the giant beast of development may eventually come and bulldoze Tanshui away one piece of land at a time .
They fear that their children , like they themselves , will have to search through photographs and memories to find Tanshui 's traditional simplicity and the joys of being close to nature .
When the old buildings are gone , and people lose contact with the great outdoors , will Tanshui even be worthy of its reputation anymore ?
Scattered wooden fishing boats bob in the river .
I have n't met any of the fishermen who these days go out and catch only small fry .
They might relate how in the old days they could just put a hand in the river and come up with a big catch .
The lonely fishing boats are waiting for the Tanshui - Pali ferry to pass by and say hello .
Those lanterns moving through the river are actually the ferry , while those stars flashing in the distance are beams of light that come from the lighthouse every five seconds .
It is only now that I realize that , even in the drabbest weather , Tanshui is still beautiful .
Taiwan 's Townships
When you look at a map , what do the 309 townships of Taiwan mean to you ?
Do you draw a complete blank on all of them ?
Or do some of the names evoke beautiful memories ?
What do these townships have to offer visitors ?
What interesting or famous characters have they given birth to ?
In this age of the global village , how much do you know about the village next door ?
Sinorama wants to take you on a journey through Taiwan 's 309 townships large and small : As they follow their individual rhythms , what is it that enables them to create their own music , and what can we hear in the songs they sing ?
Tanshui Facts and Figures
Tanshui Township -LRB- also spelled Tamsui -RRB- is part of Taipei County .
It abuts Sanchih Rural Township to the northeast , the Kuantu area of Taipei City to the southeast , and the Taiwan Strait to the northwest ; to the southwest it faces Pali Rural Township over the Tanshui River .
It covers an area of just over 70 square kilometers , and has a population of 115,000 .
It is the largest paddy - rice producing area in Taipei County .
In days gone by , because the Kuroshio current passes close by , the waters offshore were rich fishing grounds .
However , in recent years , pollution from the Tanshui River and exhaustion of fish stocks have caused the catch to dwindle .
Among the more famous tourist sites are Fort San Domingo , Yin Shan Temple , the Lixuetang school -LRB- known in English as Oxford College , founded in 1882 to train missionaries -RRB- , Huwei cannon emplacement , the mangrove conservation area , Shalun beach recreation area , the historic buildings of the Mackay Hospital and Tamkang Middle School , " Antiques Street " -LRB- Chungcheng Road -RRB- , and the ferry pier .
Public transportation includes inter-city bus service , the Tanshui Line of the Taipei mass rapid transit system , and local buses .

Turning to the Constitution on the " One China " Issue
Still wrestling with the vexed issue of " one China , " the President 's Advisory Group on Cross-Strait Relations met for its sixth and seventh sessions during November , amid frenzied media attention .
The group eventually reached a consensus that the " one China " principle advocated by the mainland should be addressed " in accordance with the constitution . "
How president Chen Shui - bian responds to this proposal will determine whether or not the " one China " stalemate can be broken , and if there is to be a set timetable for implementing the three direct links .
After assuming the presidency , Chen Shui - bian recruited a number of leading politicians , industrialists , academics and other personages for a non-partisan advisory group , intended to build cross-party consensus on the subject of relations with the mainland .
Chaired by Academia Sinica president Lee Yuan - tseh , the Presidential Advisory Group on Cross-Strait Relations first met in early September .
Since then the Group has held a series of intensive discussions on Taiwan 's fundamental position regarding the cross-strait relationship .
The Group entered the final phase of discussions on the " one China " issue during November , but differences between pro-unification and pro-independence participants continued to stymie the effort to produce a statement acceptable to all .
As DPP legislator Shen Fu - hsiung pointed out , the Group had to draft something " palatable both to the pro-unification and pro-independence camps ; something which the DPP ca n't shun and yet which does n't make Beijing wince . "
Clearly no easy task .
On the evening of November 18 Advisory Group chairman Lee Yuan - tseh , meeting over dinner with DPP faction leaders , described the cross-strait situation as extremely precarious , and said that since time is not on Taiwan 's side we need to step up efforts to resume dialogue with the mainland .
Separately , during his report to the Legislative Yuan on the Academia Sinica 's budget , Lee reiterated : " If the whole population could arrive at a consensus on ' one China , ' then President Chen would have no grounds for not accepting that consensus . "
Lee added that he hoped the Advisory Group would shortly come to a firm conclusion on the " one China " issue .
Lee Yuan - tseh 's appeal made little impression on the governing DPP , however .
Furthermore , DPP chairman Frank Hsieh himself came under fire within the party after stating : " The constitution of the ROC is itself a one China framework .
Since the DPP has participated in the process of constitutional amendment it ought to accept this constitution , and as the party of government we ca n't afford to override or reject it . "
According to DPP lawmaker Lin Cho - shui , Chen Shui - bian has shown more goodwill to Beijing as president than Lee Teng - hui ever did , but without any response -
so why should he once again be expected to respond on the " one China " issue ?
Also , Lin disagrees with Lee Yuan - tseh 's assertion that " time is not on our side , " and instead feels that things are no worse than before .
Meanwhile , the opposition alliance has been calling for the DPP to " shed its ideological baggage . "
On November 24 the New Party , which had already pulled out of the Advisory Group , published an article in the press signed by leading members such as Yu Mu - ming and Chen Kui - miao , in which they called on the government to take the constitution as its starting point for breaking the " one China " deadlock .
They pointed out that Chen and the DPP had competed in elections in accordance with the constitution , winning the presidency and a share of seats in the legislature and the National Assembly , and had also participated in the process of revising the constitution .
Now , with its constitutionally granted mandate , the party has an obligation to fully uphold the constitution .
As the politicians argued , Formosa Plastics boss Wang Yung - ching convened a meeting with other captains of industry to come up with some advice for the government on economic policy .
For the first time Wang voiced support for Lee Yuan - tseh 's proposal that " with ' one China ' as the precondition , each side can have its own interpretation . "
Wang also agreed with Lee 's notion that time is running out for Taiwan , in the belief that Taiwan will only have time on its side once it starts to carry out well - intentioned engagement with the mainland .
Consensus on the " one China question " is an urgent priority for both sides if there is to be a peaceful future .
Wang Yung - ching 's demand for a review of the government 's " go slow " policy , and opening of the three direct links , brought a personal phone call from the president , who invited him to come and discuss policy .
On November 25 Wang and a handful of other leading industrialists went to call on the president at his official residence .
The businessmen said that shelving the " one China " issue was not the right thing for the government to do , and that Taiwan could no longer afford to play word games .
They stressed the need for early restoration of the mechanism for cross-strait economic dialogue , and said that the government should also think about moving towards political dialogue .
The Presidential Advisory Group met again on November 26 , and discussed a proposal , made earlier by Public Television System chairman Wu Feng - shan and already favored by most members of the Group , for " one China " to be addressed through " three acknowledgements and four suggestions . "
A firm consensus was finally arrived at , and the Group submitted to the president its proposal that Taiwan should " respond to the mainland 's ' one China ' proposition in accordance with the constitution of the ROC . "
The government and opposition parties continued to disagree regarding this consensus .
DPP legislator Lin Cho - shui described it as " acceptable , if not very satisfactory . "
PFP spokesman Li Ching - an called it " a conclusion without a conclusion . "
New Party convenor Hau Lung - pin said the statement was too ambiguous , tending towards " one China , with each side free to make its own interpretation , " and added that it was highly unlikely to be used by the president as a guide for cross-strait policy .
Ting Shou - chung , deputy executive director of the KMT policy committee , said this so - called consensus was simply a case of going round and round on the spot , and would do nothing to solve the core problem .
In a November 28 press release , the Mainland Affairs Council -LRB- MAC -RRB- , the government body in charge of cross-strait affairs , diplomatically stated that it would observe and implement the suggestions of the Advisory Group if and when they become official government policy .
Speaking on the topic of the three direct links , MAC chairwoman Tsai Ing - wen said that these will be phased in according to conditions , with the first phase being the opening of direct business links as necessitated by the admission of both sides to the WTO .
And according to economics minister Lin Hsin - yi , the government recognizes that the " go slow " policy needs to be relaxed , and will give a more thorough accounting of this before the end of the year .
Tips for Getting through Middle Age
-LRB- Laura Li / photos by Hsueh Chi - kuang / tr. by Jonathan Barnard -RRB-
Middle age and the changes it brings are like a revolving door .
Many people peacefully go through it , growing wiser and losing their rough edges .
A minority do n't know whether to advance or retreat and get caught in it like a trap .
Middle age is a time where one wears more hats than at any other time in one 's life , when one 's responsibilities are heaviest .
As a result , the crises experienced by a minority of middle - aged people can involve a lot of other people , so their impact can not be overlooked .
Middle age , those years between 40 and 60 , is both the time of life of greatest glory and the time of life that 's easiest to overlook .
In comparison to youth or old age , the middle years are often thought of as the time when power , ability , wealth , and physical strength are all at or near their peak , so that one has no excuse for feeling melancholy .
Even if there are problems , it is commonly thought that one should be able to resolve them by oneself , notes Chiu Chia - li , director of the Hwo Chyuan Pastoral Counseling Center , who has worked on many middle - aged cases .
Social bias makes many of the middle aged afraid to discuss their problems .
This is particularly the case for men , who generally find it difficult to talk about their feelings .
But by keeping everything inside , they may cause irreparable harm to their health .
In recent years cancer , sudden death and suicide have become all too common during middle age , which shows that the psychological problems of the middle - aged should not be overlooked .
How do you safely pass through the changes of the middle years ?
Here are a few suggestions :
1. Live well at every stage of life
Li Liang - che , a professor of psychology at National Chengchi University , looks at the question from the angle of developmental psychology .
He points out that the path of life is continuous : everyone moves from infancy and childhood , to youth and middle age .
Smoothly passing through any period of life helps make getting through the next period easier .
In other words , the people most at risk during middle age are those who have had difficulties earlier in life .
Foreign research shows that those with high social and economic status and with ample financial resources bear up better during crisis and have more ways to get out of trouble .
Is it too late to start talking about these problems when you are already middle - aged ?
Chang Der - chung , an associate professor in the Department of Living Science at National Open University who worked at a counseling hotline for over a decade , argues that any step in the right direction is worthwhile , no matter when you start .
Middle - aged problems are rather predictable , and they 're not hard to avoid .
Are you worried that your marriage is growing stale ?
Then no matter how busy you are , you 've got to set aside some time to be with your spouse .
Are you worried about losing your job ?
Then start developing a second skill and get into the habit of saving and managing your money .
Are you worried about how to care for your parents when they get old and sick ?
Then spend more time with them , and encourage them to get more exercise and take care of themselves .
There are so many things to be concerned about during middle age that you had better get an early start .
Otherwise , you 'll end up being overwhelmed .
2. Start over
In China it used to be said that middle age was the period when one was " heir to the ancient sages and the teacher of posterity . "
But now times are changing so fast that perhaps the lessons of past experience are no longer suitable for solving today 's problems .
To assume a posture of superiority based on one 's seniority will make one despised .
Hence , it is necessary to cast aside one 's old self and start over .
Chiu notes that many middle - aged who have worked diligently for years to attain management positions look down on the younger generation for being reckless and disorganized , but they do n't realize that creativity and energy may be ready to explode from underneath these flaws .
Stuck in the past and full of bitterness , they may end up getting discarded onto the scrap heap of history .
With each new era , role models change .
Until the new role models have been established , it is important to maintain flexibility .
For instance , today 's middle - aged Chinese women are the first to have obtained advanced degrees and to have come in contact with the women 's liberation movement .
They set high expectations for themselves , but their disappointments are likewise large .
Many women are torn between conflicting desires : to be good homemakers like their mothers and to have successful careers like their fathers .
Their candles are burning at both ends , because they are trying to live up to two old role models rather than establishing a new one for themselves .
Then there are men who insist upon being strict fathers and disciplinarians or staying at the same company until they retire .
And there are women who are determined to play the role of the traditional Chinese wife and mother .
Ignoring the changing times , they place tremendous pressure on themselves .
3. Turn the focus from outside to inside
Life is a process that moves from the " outward " to the " inward , " says Alice Lu , director of the International Family Life Education Center , getting to the heart of the matter .
Lu explains that as children people yearn for the affection of their parents ; as adolescents they want the affirmation of their peers ; and as adults , they set their sights on educational qualifications , finding a good job , making money , marrying a good spouse and so forth .
Everyone puts the emphasis on outward manifestations of success , and this emphasis on the glitter of outward achievement continues up to middle age .
" By middle age , people have gotten from the outside world just about all they can , " says Lu .
" What they have n't attained yet they probably wo n't attain ever , so it 's not worth getting all worked up about it .
This is the time of life when the doubts set in . "
Many middle - aged people begin to ask themselves , " Is this really what I want ?
What has been the point of all my hard striving ? "
When the doubts come , some people continue trying to find answers from outside , thinking that everything would be fine if they could just change jobs or wives !
But then they rashly switch jobs or foolishly get involved in an affair only to find that they 've just made things worse .
" In middle age you start to listen to what 's going on inside , " says Lu .
" It 's the time of life when you start to hone your skills at conversing with your soul . "
People ask themselves : Am I truly happy ?
Do I like the person I see in the mirror ?
Why ?
What dreams can I pursue ?
At this point , there is no longer any need to try to measure oneself against outside standards .
Instead it 's more important to accept oneself and attempt to find an inner balance .
" One need not compare one 's inner achievements with those of other people , " notes Chiu .
Everyone 's circumstances and personalities are different , and they place different expectations on themselves .
It 's not a matter of being better or worse than anyone else , and there 's no need to follow the currents of fashion .
Everyone is unique .
Morris Chang was in his fifties when he became an entrepreneur and founded Taiwan Semiconductor .
Many others at the same time in life have opted to take early retirement and find a guru in India , work as a volunteer , or do whatever else they want to do .
In the modern age when people value different things , you can find a purely personal kind of happiness and success .
4. Realistically strive for one 's dreams
When focusing inward , many dreams that have long been discarded will end up floating to the surface .
At such times , one should remember to ask oneself three questions :
" What do I want ? " " What can I do ? " And " What must I do and have ? "
Chang Der - chung reminds people to think clearly about their needs , and then think about the costs .
Will meeting these personal needs necessarily come into conflict with meeting one 's responsibilities ?
Is there some way that the two can be accomplished simultaneously ?
When facing problems at work in Taiwan , many people decide to change careers or even to pursue their fortunes in mainland China or Southeast Asia .
Pursuing some dream of really making it big , many men use up their savings , leaving their wives as the sole source of family support and suffering loneliness in a foreign land .
There 's no right or wrong here , and there 's no way to guarantee a venture will be successful , but beforehand one must at least be realistic and prepare oneself psychologically for all possible outcomes , so that one wo n't suffer losses larger than one can bear .
" It is indeed the case that when one is young , one 's quiver is full of arrows and opportunities abound , so that one can shoot at will , " says Chang by way of analogy .
" Once you get into middle age , you 've got to make every arrow count . "
Chang explains that everyone has dreams , and that continually working toward those dreams is an excellent method of relieving stress at any age .
Middle - aged people have heavy burdens , and sometimes they may feel as if they are suffocating under them .
" But accomplishing a lot of little changes can bring about a big change . "
If you make an effort to do what you can , you will immediately find that your burdens have been lightened .
Chang cites this example : Say you hate being tied up by your work , and would like to go back to school .
Why do n't you try a weekend class ?
Maybe that would help to alleviate your anxiety .
Or if you are a housewife , taking care of three generations and resentful that you ca n't go out and get the sense of accomplishment that comes with a full - time job , then maybe you could work as a volunteer in a community organization .
This would both put you into contact with other people and help you gain a sense of accomplishment .
And you can help to sweat off your middle - aged anxieties by making a habit of regularly exercising .
What 's more , do n't worry too much about time being short .
Remember that most modern people live long lives that can be divided up into many stages .
In middle age , when you discover that your personal desires are coming into conflict with the demands of your family or society , decide which of your problems are the most urgent .
Do n't try to accomplish all of your dreams at once .
Maintain an unhurried frame of mind and peacefully wait for opportunities to present themselves .
5. Change your perspective
In middle age , one 's life is already half over , and one has already amply tasted of life 's fruits , both the bitter and the sweet .
" I am thankful for the bad times , for they have given me more insight into life and a better opportunity to understand myself , " says Lin Hung - kuei , an I - kuan Tao devotee , who has studied the Book of Changes and fengshui .
Taking care of your parents , losing your job , illness and even being cheated out of money can be embraced as opportunities to experience life .
They are lessons that the middle - aged learn from to become more proficient at the art of living .
" By changing perspective , you can understand the insignificance of your problems , " points out Chiu Chia - li .
It is very important to adjust your frame of mind .
You should n't think that there is only one way that you can be .
As long as you can accept yourself , then everything is all right .
As for losing your job in middle age , some people make NT$ 100,000 and it 's not enough .
Other's find that NT$ 20,000 is more than enough to support the family .
The problem is that by insisting on making NT$ 100,000 a month , you may pass by a suitable job that pays NT$ 20,000 .
Chang also notes that when people come to forks in the road when they reach middle age , they may look around in all directions and feel at a loss , but they 've got to encourage themselves to keep pressing ahead .
" Even if you feel uncertain , it should be a positive feeling of uncertainty . "
At the very least , you 've got to work hard at establishing a sense of direction .
When Li Liang - che starts feeling sorry for himself , he uses the age - old method of considering those who are even worse off .
Those people who are always complaining about their lot in life should take a walk around a cancer ward , " Li says .
Then they 'll realize how lucky they are . "
Chiu Chia - li , on the other hand , encourages the middle - aged not to close themselves off .
They must get out and make friends , so as to get things off their chests and find support from each other .
This makes it easier to get through the bad times .
Finally , there is something that may seem a little cliched but is often very useful - namely the realization that things will get better , that tomorrow is another day .
" Whether you are depressed or going berserk , it 's important to remember that hormones are raging inside the bodies of the middle - aged , " says Chang .
Much like rebellious adolescents , they may merely need to pass through into another stage for the sky to become blue again .
Do n't give up hope too early , and do n't be afraid of asking for assistance .
When you feel at a loss emotionally , the experts will be able to help .

The Remaking of Linpien
Home of the Black Pearl Wax Apple
-LRB- Teng Sue - feng / photos by Jimmy Lin / tr. by Christopher MacDonald -RRB-
Even if the township of Linpien does n't have a monopoly on the cultivation of " black pearl " wax apples , it was orchards in the Linpien locality that earned black pearls their national renown .
A little town formerly notorious for its ground subsidence problem , Linpien is now turning itself into one of Southern Taiwan 's premier tourist attractions .
The impetus for this change has come chiefly from local historians , along with various voluntary groups .
Just before Christmas break , the rural township of Linpien , on the Pingtung Plain at the mouth of the Linpien river , held its first ever Wax Apple Festival .
The festival , in the town 's riverside park , was held to promote black pearl wax apples and celebrate the local volunteer spirit .
It was a scorching hot day , and heavily perspiring visitors were to be seen wandering among the stalls , lugging bags of wax apples and commenting on their remarkable sweetness .
" There 's a lot more than you 'd think to growing wax apples , " says local farmer Chen Sheng - tzung .
" How you take care of the orchards , which equipment you use - it all has an affect on the shape and texture of the fruit . "
Prices for wax apples range widely , from around 3 pounds for NT$ 100 to NT$ 150 a pound .
Fruit that shows a hint of black through the red color of the skin fetches the best price .
Huang Wan - fu , whose family farms two hectares of orchard with more than 700 wax apple trees , and who has over 30 years ' experience as a fruit grower , says that while other parts of Pingtung County also grow wax apples , " Linpien stands out for its growing techniques , developed through trial and error by the growers themselves , and for vernalization rates of up to 90 % . "
Ugly duckling no more
The wax apple is a tropical fruit originating from the Malay peninsula .
The Dutch brought it to Taiwan from Java , in the 17th century , and it became commonly grown as a shade - giving tree .
Old folk in the South remember when wax apples were " just something to munch on " - the kind of fruit that grew freely and that you could help yourself to .
But wax apples have increased in value during the past 30 years , thanks to advances in the way that they are grown .
For example , the " bag - wrap " method was originally a way of protecting budding fruit from birds , but once it was introduced to Linpien , in around 1994 , farmers found it enabled them to grow more lustrous , shiny - looking wax apples , with less pesticide on the skin .
The method soon caught on throughout the district .
Another popular technique involves covering the trees with black mosquito nets to improve yields .
This reduces the amount of sunlight reaching the trees , causing nutrients from the leaves and branches to be diverted into producing fruit .
The net - covered trees blossom earlier and produce more fruit .
As a result of this technique , black pearl wax apples are now available throughout most of the year .
The " black pearl " tag did n't originate in Linpien , but it was Linpien wax apples that made the variety famous and prompted the dramatic growth of its market .
In 1983 the then - provincial governor Lee Teng - hui visited the town and praised the quality of its black pearl wax apples , so assuring the renown of the fruit .
Subsequently , as president , Lee Teng - hui often gave gifts of black pearl wax apples to foreign dignitaries .
Green hills
The success of black pearl wax apples gave Linpien a much - needed boost , bringing some of the younger generation back to the area to grow the fruit .
The credit for putting wax apples at the heart of the town 's revival and for mounting the Wax Apple Festival belongs with a group of volunteer workers - local people committed to the town 's regeneration .
How does a small town like Linpien come to be home to such a well - organized volunteer effort , and just how did the volunteers set about giving their town a make - over ?
The story begins with the town 's riverside park .
The road linking the town 's main street with the riverside park , where locals like to stroll and chat at the beginning and end of the day , used to be overgrown and lined with trash .
Now , however , thanks to a coordinated effort involving volunteers , residents and landlords , the verges are planted with sunflowers and lantana , while a former mud patch , donated rent - free by its owner , has been converted into a carp - filled lotus pool .
The revamping of Linpien started eight or nine years ago , when schoolteacher Tsao Chi - hung - now a DPP deputy in the national legislature - along with fellow members of the Linpien Residents ' Democracy Association launched a program to sweep the streets and keep the riverbank clean .
Wu Wu - ta , a plumber who runs the Democracy Association , says : " People were already doing their bit for the community over ten years ago , but not openly .
They swept the streets before dawn because they did n't want people to see them and call them crazy . "
It was only three years ago , with the founding of the non-political Linpien Natural History Conservation Association , that residents began to publicly support the project .
The flood - prone Linpien River has been dyked and dredged since the Japanese colonial era , but the bare concrete embankments never did much for the scenery .
In 1999 Tsao Chi - hung learned that the Water Conservancy Bureau was planning to renovate the flood defenses , and he proposed a scheme for " greenification " of the riverside area .
Objections were raised , however , with some pointing out that the site , if left untended , could easily get overgrown and become a breeding ground for snakes and vermin .
The issue was discussed and finally the Bureau agreed to let volunteers maintain the riverside area for two years .
If the scheme did n't work out then the Bureau would concrete over the site as originally planned .
Following the lead of the conservation association and the Democracy Association , various volunteer groups in the district - including the senior citizens ' club , members of Tzu Chi Buddhist Foundation , the Presbyterian Church , and followers of the I - Kuan Tao sect - signed up to share responsibility for the riverside park , which was divided into 90 - meter - long plots for the purpose .
Turf was laid , flower beds appeared , and the embankment soon became a 1.2 km - long " green Great Wall . "
Dreaming by the river
" You ca n't go about community work in a standoffish way , and you certainly ca n't operate effectively from behind the scenes - you have to be out there at the front of things .
When local people see teachers and doctors coming out to collect trash , they feel encouraged to join in , " says Chen Chin - chao , a dentist who chairs the Linpien Natural History Conservation Association .
Chen frets about the way the media has focused the spotlight on him alone , when numerous other individuals are also involved , all chipping in what they can .
" The biggest achievement is that the flowers have n't been stolen , " says Tsao Chi - hung .
" As more people volunteer to help , disruptive behavior becomes less and less likely . "
The riverside area used to be a teenage hangout , known for its drinking and fighting , but since greenification the town 's residents have been coming here to stroll and enjoy the scenery : green hills to the East , the sunset in the West , and the dreamy river alongside the park .
" The more that people get involved the greater their sense of accomplishment , " says Tsao .
" It 's not just about tidying up the environment .
We also hope to foster the commercial interests of the community so as to bring practical benefits for people 's lives . "
This was the thinking behind Tsao 's gathering together of various groups for the Wax Apple Festival .
According to the archives , 400 years ago Linpien was a plains - aborigine settlement called " Fang - suo - she . "
In the middle of the 17th century the Ming dynasty loyalist Zheng Chenggong -LRB- also known as Koxinga -RRB- brought an influx of settlers to Taiwan from the Fujian and Guangdong regions of China .
Some of the Fang - suo - she aborigines stayed and intermarried with Chinese , while others moved away .
The oldest recorded use of the name " Linpien " is on a stele , erected in 1762 , next to the town 's Sanshan King Temple .
The name , which means " beside the forest , " indicates that the early settlers must have had a tough time clearing land for their crops .
Moving to center - stage
In the past half century or more Linpien has concentrated on a series of different forms of produce , from rice , to bananas , to prawn and eel farming , to wax apples - today 's main crop .
With Taiwan 's imminent accession to the WTO , the next big change could be just around the corner .
For example , will wax apples lose their market to imported fruit ?
And what does Linpien have to offer that other districts in the county ca n't easily duplicate ?
Yang Hung - jen , a PhD student at National Taiwan University 's Graduate Institute of Sociology , came to Linpien a year ago to research his thesis on the renewal of the local community .
" I had come to what was said to be the worst county in Taiwan for factionalism and corruption , " says Yang , " a place where the ground had sunk as much as three meters due to subsidence .
But the contrast between that image and what I actually found here was quite something . "
For Yang , the way that those most active in the renewal effort routinely pass the credit to others is itself impressive .
Linpien rose to prominence on the strength of its celebrated wax apples .
But can it now push its way to center - stage as a tourist attraction ?
Says Chen Chin - chao : " We ca n't yet say how things will turn out for Linpien .
But that 's not to be pessimistic about the town 's prospects ; it 's simply a case of not building castles in the air . "
Development of the long - promised Tapeng Bay Scenic Area is due to begin , and in 2003 the 2nd Southern Freeway will open .
Will this bring more prosperity to the area ?
Construction of a bypass around the town has already boosted property values , but what other benefits may it bring ?
A golf course is mooted , but will that mean the loss of birdwatching zones and the mangrove woods ?
Can the wax apple orchards be adapted to serve as a setting for family outings ?
And can fish farms in the locality be converted to provide housing and accommodation , and a recreation alternative for visitors ?
Can this little town make an asset of its scenic location and historical roots to attract more visitors ?
Linpien used to be little more than a brief stop for travelers on their way to the seaside resort of Kenting , but now its residents are wondering if they can turn the town into a destination in its own right .
Linpien Facts and Figures
Linpien Rural Township is in Pingtung County , located on the Pingtung Plain at the mouth of the Linpien River .
It is adjacent to the planned Tapeng Bay Scenic Area , and marks the point where the 2nd Southern Freeway will terminate .

Aquaculture provides for full nets and full bellies , but it is also the culprit behind Linpien 's severe subsidence problem .
The acreage of fish farms has halved in recent years , due to the combination of falling profits and environmental degradation .
p. 47
Subsidence has been caused by the over-extraction of ground - water for aquaculture .
Some of the houses on the Linpien - Chiatung coastal strip have sunk to the degree that their windows are level with the street and their rooves are within easy reach .

From Hong Kong 's airport , you can go straight to Dongguan on a Global Express bus .
With 27 departures a day , these buses run by a Taiwan firm out of Dongguan take Taiwan expats to their adopted home , which boasts the largest concentration of Taiwan firms in the PRC .
Invoking the Taiwanese business battle cry of " victory to those who strive the hardest , " 20,000 - 30,000 Taiwan expats in Dongguan have in little more than a decade turned a county of banana and lichee plantations into a big city with exports behind only Shenzhen 's and Shanghai 's .

Ju Gao - jeng , a former ROC legislator who now has an academic post in Beijing , is talking to a reporter from Taipei about the ROC presidential elections - a hot topic of conversation on both sides of the Taiwan strait .
Amid all the merrymaking , one gets a sense of what Shanghai must have been like in the thirties .
In Dongguan at the turn of the 21st century , however , it is the Taiwanese business people who have been playing the leading roles .
High concentration of Taiwan firms
Before the 21st century had even arrived , a bright economic star had risen over southern China .
Ever since economic reforms accelerated on the mainland when Deng Xiaoping made a tour of the south in early 1992 , four southern Cantonese cities - Zhongshan , Dongguan , Shunde , and Nanhai - have earned a reputation as the " four tigers " of Guangdong Province .
Dongguan leads the pack .
" The year before last its total exports were third on the mainland , trailing only Shenzhen 's and Shanghai 's , " says Jiang Suwu , a graduate of Wuhan University 's Chinese department who came south to work in the planning department of a Taiwan firm in Dongguan .
" It had more than 15,000 foreign , Taiwan , and Hong Kong firms , and economic growth for that year reached 26 % . "
In ancient times Dongguan was covered with lichee plantations whose fruit was favored by the imperial consort Yang Guifei .
Just a little more than a decade ago Dongguan was still a largely agricultural area , its landscape a patchwork of rice paddies and corn fields .
It has since been completely made over into a " boundless industrial park " with an area of 2,520 square kilometers , a population of more than 5 million , and more than 3,000 Taiwan firms .
Chang Han - wen , the chairman of the Taiwan Business Association of Dongguan -LRB- TBAD -RRB- , says that development started in the late 1980s .
Hong Kong firms , with their proximity and fluent Cantonese -LRB- also the local dialect in Dongguan -RRB- , were first .
The Taiwanese , first coming about 1989 , followed .
Each arrival seemed to bring many more on its heels .
Taiwan firms are now the most important source of foreign investment in Dongguan .
Consider the booming electronics industry .
Eighty percent of Dongguan 's 1,800 computer - related companies are from Taiwan , Hong Kong and Macau .
In terms of production value , they account for at least half of this RMB 50 billion local industry .
Dongguan holds the highest concentration of Taiwan firms anywhere on the mainland .
According to TBAD statistics , there are now 30,000 Taiwanese companies on the mainland , -LRB- official PRC statistics , which include service - industry firms , put the number at 45,000 -RRB- .
Guangdong Province can boast one - third of the total , of which 3,200 are in Dongguan .
Most of these are telecom , cable , plastics , shoes , electronics and electric machinery companies .
Why has Dongguan been such a magnet for Taiwan firms ?
Kao Wen - lai points out that Dongguan is strategically located between Shenzhen and Guangzhou -LRB- Canton -RRB- and accessible to the entire Pearl River delta .
It is three hours by car to Hong Kong and one and a half hours by boat to Humen .
When compared to Shenzhen , moreover , land and labor in Dongguan are cheap .
" The local cadres have been smart , providing all manner of land and tax incentives , " says Chen Ming - chih , TBAD 's secretary general .
Two keys to the miracle
One afternoon in the days before the Chinese New Year , Chinese businessmen wearing suits arrived at the People 's Government administration building in Dongguan 's Qishi district .
After a long wait , they sat down at a table to negotiate with Qishi 's Communist Party secretary , the district chief , and various staff from its foreign economic office .
Qishi 's factory rents , electricity charges and land leases were all focuses of discussion .
TBAD , as is frequently the case , introduced the two parties .
" The factory rent was set at RMB 8.00 -LRB- about NT$ 32 -RRB- a square meter .
The electricity charge was RMB .87 a kilowatt hour , and there were various tax incentives , " explains Wang Jung - tuo , who notes there is still room for negotiation .
All in all , it was a very attractive package .
In 1990 , Wang went to Malaysia thinking about opening a factory there , but he discovered that Malaysia 's market was much smaller than the mainland 's and its labor costs twice as high .
The style of life was too different there , there was a language divide , and the roads were poor .
The mainland was a much better fit for him and his printed circuit boards company .
Now , little more than a decade later , its 20 - 30 workers have grown to 2,000 .
The company is once again preparing to expand its physical plant .
He acknowledges that it was a risky move to come to mainland China , but " if you 're going to die , you might as well die among your own people . "
He traces his ancestry to Guangdong and affirms that his decision to set up in mainland China " involves ethnic pride . "
Although low land and labor costs are Dongguan 's main attractions , Taiwan firms also choose the locale for the networks of people and producers that have been built up among Taiwanese in Dongguan over the last ten years .
These two kinds of networks , says H.D. Yeh - who served as TBAD 's president for two terms - were instrumental in creating the " Taiwanese economic miracle . "
H.D. Yeh points out that competition in the 21st century is all about speed .
When customers in America make purchase orders , the whole process , including drawing up the contract and manufacturing the goods , requires four months .
But Taiwanese firms can deliver in 15 days .
" There are two keys , " he says .
" One is that all the upstream and downstream factories are here .
You can assemble a computer completely from parts made within 50 kilometers . "
And the second key is that when you deal with Taiwanese companies , you do n't have to endure a long contract process .
Everything starts rolling with a single telephone call .
Taiwanese business people are always playing golf , singing karaoke or chewing betel nut together .
" Everyone is always asking how everyone else is doing - it 's a way of networking and building up good relations , " Yeh says .
Andrew Yeh recalls that when the company first set up in Dongguan in 1990 , " Even screws had to be brought in from Taiwan . "
But now the company sources virtually all of the necessary raw materials and parts on the mainland and is reliant for very little on Taiwan .
" What does industrial emigration entail ?
Usually it means downstream industries coming first , forcing the mid-stream industries to follow , " says Sylvia Yang , deputy chairperson of TBAD 's women 's division .
And in Dongguan downstream Taiwan firms have expanded into the mid-stream , becoming more vertically integrated .
Tahsin Printing only made paper boxes in Taiwan but when they set up a plant in Dongguan they discovered that it was hard to obtain the paper rolls they needed and thus learned how to make them themselves .
Now the company makes paper boxes both from rolled paper and from colored flat paper .
To each its own domain
Many companies have expanded into new business realms in Dongguan .
A frequently cited example is Primax , H.D. Yeh 's electronics firm .
The company rented a factory in Dongguan in 1989 and at first produced labor - intensive power surge protectors .
After three years , they began in 1992 to invest massively on the mainland , establishing computer mouse production lines .
Thereafter , Primax launched new products every year : cellular phone parts , overhead projectors , paper shredders , scanners . . .
Constantly expanding its product lines and production capacity , Primax expanded from a single Dongguan plant with 25 workers in 1989 to its current nine factories and 4,000 - plus workforce .
Primax 's performance , H.D. Yeh notes , pushed its mother company in Taiwan to go public seven years ago .
Primax is one of the few Taiwan electronics companies with a definite " China orientation . "
" It does n't cost much to set up a factory in mainland China , and shipping times are stable .
These are helpful to the mother company both in terms of controlling costs and filling large orders , " says Yeh .
Dongguan Hsu Fu Chi Foods , which sells candy , cakes and candied fruit in the mainland domestic market , is another good example .
They began production there in 1992 , formally opening their own plant in Dongguan in 1994 .
The company now has three factories in Dongguan , with a combined area of 120,000 square meters , that produce 200 tons of candy , 70 tons of Chinese - style cakes , and 180 tons of gelatin and pudding a day .
" We produce 300 - 500 container loads of food a month .
You can find our cakes in supermarkets all the way from Guangzhou to Tibet . "
Norman Hsu , the company 's vice president , says that after one invests on the mainland , layouts of Taiwan factories seem exceedingly cramped .
" There 's a totally different sense of space . "
" Dongguan is by itself one - thirteenth the size of Taiwan , " notes Chen Ming - chih , secretary general of the Taiwan Business Association .
In Dongguan factories are more than ten times the sizes of similar plants in Taiwan .
One factory building at the Talingshan furniture plant is 380 meters long .
Walking the perimeter of a leading electronics plant in Qishi is " like playing four holes of golf . "
Like soldiers , workers often have to take different shifts in the cafeteria .
The Pouchen shoe plant , Dongguan 's largest , employs 100,000 .
The compound has a nursery , hospital and an operating room .
" We always jokingly refer to it as Fort Pouchen , " says Yeh .
Victory to the strivers
Although the Taiwan firms in Dongguan have left home , their success can largely be attributed to an ethos they transplanted from Taiwan - that " victory goes to those who strive the hardest . "
" In Taiwan , we used to take the children somewhere fun on weekends and holidays , " says Chang Mei - liang of TBAD 's women 's division .
But since she 's moved the factory , " there has n't been a single meal the whole family has eaten together . "
If you want to open a plant on the mainland , you 're going to have to sacrifice family intimacy . "
In Taiwan , a boss just has to set the factory 's basic course and at the very most supervise the executives , " explains Sylvia Yang , the women 's division 's deputy chairperson .
" But on the mainland , a boss has to supervise everything : customs , tax payments , workers ' disputes , meal preparation . . . .
There 's always the feeling that everyone will start to slack off once the boss leaves . "
All the job - related pressures and evenings out with fellow Taiwanese business people or Communist Party cadres result in ill health for many Taiwan business people on the mainland .
One of Chen 's tasks as chairperson of TBAD is to handle funeral arrangements for Taiwanese business people there .
" Many of them die suddenly , " he says .
The association has been trying to promote healthier lifestyles .
" Instead of just going out to karaoke bars and drinking , why not play golf too , " recommends H.D. Yeh .
Dongguan has four or five golf courses within city limits .
About 1,000 people play every day , and 80 - 90 % of them are Taiwanese .
The Taiwanese entrepreneurial spirit has blossomed here by processing goods for export through Hong Kong in addition to making the most of connections between local Taiwan firms .
With 3,000 Taiwan - owned businesses here , and 10 - 20,000 Taiwanese business people and their dependants coming in and out every day , the Dong - guan area has already developed an economic circle in which Taiwan firms can conduct most of their business among themselves .
In the vibrant district of Houjian , there is an area that locals call Taiwan Town .
A casual look around reveals shop signs familiar to any Taiwanese : Taichung Goose , Ah - shui Shih 's Pig Knuckle Kingdom , Yungho Soy Milk , the Mantu Hair Salon . . . . and most of the customers are Taiwanese .
Restaurants serve up authentic Taiwanese fare like " pineapples and bitter melon chicken " and " sesame oil chicken . "
In November 1998 Global Express , a Taiwan firm , even opened up a shuttle bus to Hong Kong 's airport .
Global Express serves as a good example of Taiwanese corporate agility .
Originally , arrivals from Taiwan en route to Dongguan had to board buses run by a Hong Kong - based and mainland - financed travel agency .
" But we felt that the service left something to be desired , and that a lot of time would always be wasted while holders of ' Taiwanese Compatriot Visas ' cleared customs , " notes David Chang , Global Travel Holding 's executive director .
Two years ago , this Taiwanese travel agency began to talk with the mainland customs and border inspection agencies and negotiated a deal to get the route .
" We tell Taiwanese business people that riding our buses is safe , the service is good , and that it makes the trip through customs easy . "
In enemy territory
As soon as you 're through customs at Hong Kong , you see them : women draped with beauty pageant - like sashes with the Chinese characters for " Global Travel " emblazoned across them .
Pushing small luggage carts , they lead customers to the buses .
They have become a " must - see " tourist sight for Taiwanese visitors to Dongguan .
" At first we thought of talking with Hong Kong airport about renting a counter , " explains Chang .
" But for just one - fourth of a six square - meter booth , the rent comes to HK$ 200,000 . "
So the company thought that instead of spending that much money on a booth it made more sense to lower operating costs and pass these along in the form of lower fares for its customers .
They never expected that the luggage carts would in fact make it much easier for customers to find them in sprawling Hong Kong airport and would become an easily recognizable company trademark .
" Now mainland Chinese travel agencies have started copying the way we use the carts , " says Chang , laughing .
Since Global buses started plying this route in November 1988 , daily bus departures have risen from 4 to 27 , with over 20,000 riders a month .
Global plans to introduce new services , including car rentals and plane ticket reservations and confirmations .
Dongguan appears to have a bright future .
" The Taiwan firms here now are powerful enough to get two or three members of the Legislative Yuan to represent their interests , " holds one senior reporter .
Although TBAD 's Yeh believes that investment prospects on the mainland are good , he does acknowledge the precariousness of their position in hostile territory .
Taiwan business interests can not put down their guard .
Because of Taiwan 's experience with rapid modernization , many CCP cadres have sought employment with Taiwanese firms , hoping to learn from the masters .
At the first opportunity , however , they leave to set up shop for themselves .
" The student then challenges the master , " explains Sylvia Yang , detailing how these mainland upstarts go on to compete with the very Taiwan firms that taught them all they know .
This scenario should be familiar to Taiwanese .
" It happens in Taiwan too . "
Apart from keeping up their guard , it is even more important that Taiwan firms raise their productivity and technological level .
" Many manufacturers , even those in mainland China , will not survive , " says Yeh .
Taiwan firms find it difficult to adjust to the instability of the mainland 's investment environment , as well as the laws there that seemingly change overnight .
The year before last the mainland announced a new tax system , under which raw materials imported by foreign firms would be taxed at a rate of 17 % , with 9 % being returned to the manufacturer when finished goods were exported .
" When I went to Beijing to negotiate , " recalls Yeh , " I asked cadres in the foreign trade office to consider the impact of the tax on the electronics industry .
Profit margins are at best 3 - 5 % .
How can manufacturers afford to pay a 17 % import tax ? "
In June of last year the PRC authorities announced the " Document # 35 " rules .
These stipulated that companies would be given grades according to the quantity of their exports and their records of breaking customs regulations .
Those meriting only a B would have to offer a deposit of 40 - 50 % against the value of their raw material imports .
This terrified Taiwan firms in Dongguan .
According to TBAD 's statistics , 75 % of the Taiwanese firms were given Bs .
The announcement caused quite a stir , but its effect on Taiwanese investment is as yet unclear .
In August of last year , as the mainland customs authorities took aggressive moves against smuggling , 12 Taiwan business people in Dongguan were detained .
The charges ran the gamut from not filling out proper forms to purchasing phony export contracts and trying to pass them off to customs .
Seven business people were arrested and charged with smuggling and are still in jail .
" I 'm constantly thinking about them .
I 'm meditating and have gone vegetarian , but I 'm still not at peace , " Yeh says .
On the mainland , the highest penalty for smuggling is death .
" Last year the mainland sent nine customs officers to the firing squad , " notes Yeh .
The fate of these Taiwanese businessmen will depend entirely on the mainland 's political climate .
Whether its arrival was by accident or design , a new age for Taiwanese firms in Dongguan is here .
It is a far cry from the days when Taiwan firms enjoyed tremendous advantages .
From the various revisions to trade law adopted by the PRC last year , Chang Han - wen extrapolates that the PRC both wants to protect its uncompetitive state firms and turn from low - tech processing to high - tech production .
" This is because state enterprises pressure the government with appeals about their right to survival , " Yeh says .
When foreign firms in the mainland are confronted with threats to their safety and property , " Hong Kong can count on the cooperation of the government , US and Japanese businesses can turn to their ambassadors , but what can Taiwan firms do ? " asks Yeh .
In Dongguan they can help each other .
Currently , more than 80 % of the 3,000 Taiwanese firms in Dongguan have joined TBAD .
TBAD has 29 local branches in Dongguan and is , moreover , the only Taiwan business association in mainland China with a women 's division .
Major companies listed on the TAIEX , including Lite - on Electronics and Delta Electronics , are members of TBAD .
It is the largest and strongest of all Taiwan business groups on the mainland both in terms of organization and operations .
Many Taiwanese believe that at a time of cross-strait tension , Taiwan firms have made their own decisions to invest in the mainland and therefore should bear the risk themselves too .
And by investing their money , technology and so forth on the mainland , are they not to some degree abandoning Taiwan ?
TBAD takes issue with this view .
H.D. Yeh points out that in 1998 Taiwan had an overall trade surplus of US$ 5.9 billion , and a surplus of US$ 12.76 billion with mainland China .
If not for its trade with the PRC , therefore , Taiwan would have had a trade deficit .
" We make our money here , but we pay taxes in Taiwan , and most of our families and children do most of their consumer spending in Taiwan , " insists TBAD chairperson Chang Mei - liang .
Chang notes that after the major earthquake in Taiwan on September 21 , Taiwan business associations throughout mainland China contributed NT$ 60 million .
TBAD contributed NT$ 30 million all by itself .
Hence , he argues that it 's very unfair to say that Taiwanese businesses in the mainland are n't contributing to Taiwan .
The question is , how should the ROC government view Taiwan firms in the mainland ?
And for that matter how is the PRC government looking at the Taiwanese in Dongguan ?
TBAD 's spiritual leader H.D. Yeh often goes to Beijing to represent Taiwan firms in negotiations with the government .
Once , in the presence of many Communist Party cadres , a high - ranking official of the State Council 's Taiwan Affairs Office asked him this question : " You 've gathered so many Taiwan firms in Dongguan and stirred up such enthusiasm among them - but for what purpose ? "
It threw him for a loop .
Yeh is still trying to figure out what the mainland authorities think of TBAD .
For Taiwan firms in Dongguan , investing in mainland China is a road of no return .
" In recent years many Taiwan business people have also tried to invest in Vietnam , only later to close their factories there , " says Chang Han - wen .
Mainland China shares the same language as Taiwan and it offers attractive investment conditions .
It would be surprising if it did n't attract Taiwan firms that are eager to set up offshore .
Amid the cross-strait political standoff , one can expect that Taiwan firms in Dongguan will continue to live out this exciting tale of gain and loss .
